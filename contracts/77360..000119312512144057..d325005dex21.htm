_Section 1.07_ _Effect on Capital Stock_. (a) At the Effective Time, by

share of Patriot Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than shares of Patriot Common Stock not entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07(b) hereof, shall be
converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of
Fountain Common Stock. The shares of Fountain Common Stock to be issued upon
the conversion of Patriot Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.07 and cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock to be paid as
contemplated by Section 1.12 are referred to collectively as the " _Merger

shares of Patriot Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10 and Section
1.13 upon surrender of such certificate, without interest. The issuance of
Fountain Common Stock in connection with the Merger is referred to as the "
_Fountain Stock Issuance_."

(b) Each share of Patriot Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of Patriot or
Fountain shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time, but shall not
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01

Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.16 2/3 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. 

 



4 _Section 1.08_ _Patriot Stock Options and Equity-Based Awards_. (a) No later
than immediately before the Effective Time, Patriot and Fountain shall take
such actions as may be required to provide that:

(i) each outstanding Patriot Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall
be converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Patriot Stock Option
immediately before the Effective Time, a number of shares of Fountain Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Patriot Common Stock subject to such
Patriot Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time at a price
per share (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per
share of Patriot Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Patriot
Stock Option (each Patriot Stock Option as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted
Stock Option_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such conversion shall be
effected in accordance with Section 424(a) of the Code.

(ii) each outstanding Patriot RSU, whether vested or unvested, shall be
converted at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit, subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Patriot RSU
immediately before the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of
Fountain Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Patriot Common Stock
subject to such Patriot RSU immediately before the Effective Time (each
Patriot RSU as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted RSU_ ");

(iii) each outstanding Patriot Restricted Share shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive a number of shares of Fountain Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Patriot Common Stock subject to such
Patriot Restricted Share immediately before the Effective Time, subject
to the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Patriot
Restricted Share immediately before the Effective Time (each Patriot
Restricted Share as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Restricted Share_ "); and

 

(iv) each outstanding Patriot Other Share-Based Award, whether vested or
unvested, shall be converted at the Effective Time into an award with respect
to shares of Fountain Common Stock, subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Patriot Other Share-Based Award immediately
before the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of Fountain
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Patriot Common Stock subject to
such Patriot Other Share-Based Award immediately before the Effective Time
(each Patriot Other Share-Based Award as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted
Other Share-Based Award_ ").

(b) Patriot and Fountain shall take such actions as may be required to provide
that any then-current purchase period under a Patriot Stock Purchase Plan
shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms following the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that at the end of each such purchase period, with respect
to an applicable participant, such participants accumulated payroll
deduction shall be used to purchase shares of Fountain Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Patriot Stock Purchase Plan.

 



5 (c) Fountain shall take all actions necessary to reserve for issuance, from
and after the Effective Time, a sufficient number of shares of Fountain
Common Stock for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section
1.08. At or before the Effective Time, Fountain shall cause to be filed with
the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective
amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the Securities
Act with respect to the Adjusted Restricted Shares and the shares of Fountain
Common Stock subject to Adjusted Stock Options, Adjusted RSUs and Adjusted
Other Share-Based Awards and shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as to comply with
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such
awards remain outstanding.

(d) By approving this Agreement, (i) the Board of Directors of Fountain
shall be deemed to have approved and authorized each and every amendment to
any of the Fountain Benefit Plans as may be necessary or appropriate to give
effect to the provisions of Section 1.08, and (ii) the Board of Directors of
Patriot shall be deemed to have approved and authorized each and every
amendment to any of the Patriot Benefit Plans, Patriot Stock Options, Patriot
RSUs, Patriot Restricted Shares and Patriot Other Share-Based Awards as may be
necessary or appropriate to give effect to the provisions of Section 1.08.

_Section 1.09_ _Exchange of Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, Patriot
shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Trident as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). In connection with the foregoing,
Trident, Fountain, Merger Sub and, as necessary, AcquisitionCo, shall enter
into an exchange and nominee agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Patriot, setting forth the procedures to be used in
accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this Section
1.09 and Section 1.10. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Fountain shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Patriot Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article I through
the Exchange Agent, evidence in book-entry form representing the shares of
Fountain Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Article I in exchange for
outstanding shares of Patriot Common Stock. For the purposes of such deposit,
Fountain shall assume that there shall not be any fractional shares of
Fountain Common Stock. Fountain shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed or as
reasonably requested by Patriot, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.12 and cash sufficient to
pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 1.13. All
evidence in book-entry form of Fountain Common Stock including cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section
1.12 and the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to the Patriot Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.13 are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall, subject to the terms of the exchange agent and nominee
agreement entered into with Trident, Fountain, Merger Sub and, as necessary,
AcquisitionCo, deliver the Fountain Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Article I out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

_Section 1.10_ _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time of the Merger, and to the extent not previously distributed
in connection with the Distribution, Fountain shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to any holder of record of outstanding shares of Patriot Common Stock
whose shares of Patriot Common Stock were

 



6  converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.07(a): (a) a letter of transmittal and (b) instructions
for use in effecting the exchange of any shares of Patriot Common Stock for
Merger Consideration. Upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of the letter of
transmittal, duly executed and with such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares of Patriot Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (i) that number of
whole shares of Fountain Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of
Patriot Common Stock exchanged by such holder), which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article I, (ii) payment by cash or check in
lieu of fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock which such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.12 and (iii) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.13. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable shares of Patriot Common Stock is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
applicable shares of Patriot Common Stock to be exchanged be in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration pay any and all transfer and other similar
Taxes required to be paid as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares of Patriot Common
Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes
have been paid or are not payable. Until exchanged as contemplated by this
Section 1.10, any shares of Patriot Common Stock shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such exchange the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 1.10 and any amounts to be paid pursuant to
Section 1.12 and/or Section 1.13. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the
Merger Consideration or any cash payable upon exchange of any shares of
Patriot Common Stock.

_Section 1.11_ _No Further Ownership Rights in Patriot Common Stock_. The
portion of the Merger Consideration issued (and paid) and any cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article I upon conversion of any shares of
Patriot Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Patriot Common Stock.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Patriot shall be closed
with respect to the shares of Patriot Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Patriot Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares of Patriot
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

_Section 1.12_ _No Fractional Shares_. (a) No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock or book-entry credit
of the same shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of Patriot Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.07(a), no dividends or other distributions of
Fountain shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a holder of Fountain Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 1.12, all
fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be
aggregated, and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

 



7 (b) Fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock that would otherwise be
allocable to any former holders of shares of Patriot Common Stock in the
Merger shall be aggregated, and no holder of shares of Patriot Common Stock
shall receive cash equal to or greater than the value of one full share of
Fountain Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole shares
obtained thereby to be sold, in the open market or otherwise as reasonably
directed by Fountain, and in no case later than 30 Business Days after the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall make available the net proceeds
thereof, after deducting any required brokerage charges, commissions and
transfer Taxes, on a pro rata basis, without interest, as soon as practicable
to the holders of shares of Patriot Common Stock entitled to receive such
cash. Payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock
shall be made solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Fountain of issuing fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock and shall
not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

_Section 1.13_ _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.
No dividends or other distributions with respect to Fountain Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unexchanged shares of Patriot Common Stock with respect to the shares of
Fountain Common Stock issuable upon exchange thereof, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
1.12, until, in each case, the exchange of such shares of Patriot Common Stock
in accordance with this Article I. Subject to applicable Law, following the
exchange of any such shares of Patriot Common Stock, there shall be paid to
the record holder of whole shares of Fountain Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (a) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Fountain Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.12 and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Fountain Common Stock
and (b) at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such exchange payable with
respect to such whole shares of Fountain Common Stock. In no event shall the
Exchange Agent have the right to vote any shares of Fountain Common Stock held
by the Exchange Agent.

_Section 1.14_ _Withholding Rights_. Fountain, Patriot, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Persons with respect to
which such deduction and withholding was made. Fountain, Patriot, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall pay, or
shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate
Governmental Authority within the period required under applicable Law. 

_Section 1.15_ _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of shares of Patriot Common Stock for 180
calendar days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Fountain upon
demand, and any holders of shares of Patriot Common Stock

 



8  who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look
only to Fountain for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fountain Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.12 and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 1.13.

 

 _Section 1.16_ _No Liability_. None of the Parties or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Patriot Common
Stock or Fountain Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TRIDENT_

For all purposes of this Article II, for the avoidance of doubt, Fountain and
each other member of the Fountain Group shall be a Subsidiary of Trident

Distribution). Trident hereby represents and warrants to Patriot that, except
(i) as set forth in the applicable section (or another section to the extent
provided in Section 8.14) of the Trident Disclosure Letter or (ii) to the
extent disclosed or identified in any report, schedule, form or other document
filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by Trident and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement and after September 26, 2009, or in the Draft
Form 10, to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure to the applicable
representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on its face (other than any
forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section (except for
any disclosure therein related to historical facts), any disclosures in any
section relating to forward-looking statements and any other similar
disclosures included therein to the extent that they are primarily cautionary
in nature):

 

 _Section 2.01_ _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. (a)
Trident is a corporation limited by shares ( _Aktiengesellschaft_ ) that is
duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of Switzerland with its
legal seat in the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Fountain is a
corporation limited by shares ( _Aktiengesellschaft_ ) that is duly organized
and validly existing under the Laws of Switzerland with its legal seat in the
Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Each Fountain Sub is a corporation or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(where applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, except where the failure to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Fountain
Business MAE. AcquisitionCo is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Merger
Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Minnesota. Trident and its Subsidiaries have
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate their
respective properties, rights and Assets that shall be contributed to the
Fountain Group pursuant to the Separation Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement and to carry on the Fountain Business as it is now being
conducted. Trident and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (to the extent such concept is
recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the
properties, rights or Assets owned, leased or operated by the Fountain

 



9  Business that shall be contributed to the Fountain Group pursuant to the
Separation Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the nature of the Fountain
Business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Fountain Business MAE.

 

(b) Section 2.01(b) of the Trident Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, a list of the Fountain Subs and their respective jurisdictions
of incorporation or organization. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Fountain Sub are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will be, as of
the Separation, owned directly or indirectly by Fountain, free and clear of
all Security Interests other than restrictions under the Securities Act or

Trident Organizational Documents and the Fountain Organizational Documents.

 

 _Section 2.02_ _Authorization of Agreement_. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements by each of

consummation by each of them of the Transactions, have been duly authorized
and approved by their respective Boards of Directors and this Agreement has
been approved and adopted by (i) Fountain as the sole shareholder of
AcquisitionCo and (ii) AcquisitionCo as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. No
other corporate or shareholder action on the part of Trident, Fountain,
AcquisitionCo or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements or the
consummation of the Transactions, except for the (x) approval of
the Distribution and any related resolutions necessary to effect the
Distribution by shareholders of Trident holding a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast (the " _Trident Shareholder Approval_ "), (y) appointment

paid up share capital, including a sufficient number of shares, to effect the
Distribution and the Merger and to have such amount of additional treasury
shares as may be proposed by Patriot and approved by Trident (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which authorization
shall be undertaken prior to the Distribution pursuant to Section 3.7 of the
Separation Agreement. The Board of Directors of Trident has resolved to
recommend, subject to the terms of this Agreement, that the Trident
Shareholders approve the Distribution (the " _Trident Recommendation_ "), and
such resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn prior to
the date hereof.

Ancillary Agreements to which each is a party, when executed, shall be, duly
executed and delivered by each of Trident, Fountain, AcquisitionCo and Merger
Sub, as applicable, and, to the extent it is a party thereto, each is (or when

Fountain, AcquisitionCo and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Trident,
Fountain, AcquisitionCo and Merger Sub, as applicable, in accordance with
their terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to

 



10  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

Stock are, and all such shares of Fountain Common Stock that may be issued

Separation Agreement shall be when issued, duly authorized and validly
issued, fully paid in and nonassessable and not issued in violation of any

the right to subscribe for, any Fountain Equity Interests and (ii) there are
no outstanding obligations of Fountain to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any outstanding Fountain Equity Interests.

 



11 (d) Except as provided by the Separation Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement
or the Fountain Organizational Documents, there are no voting trusts or other

Agreement and the Transactions. AcquisitionCo and Merger Sub were formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. 

(f) As of the Effective Time, Fountain and the Fountain Group will not have
any indebtedness for borrowed money (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not be deemed to include capital leases) (other than intercompany indebtedness
for borrowed money solely among members of the Fountain Group) or be subject
to guarantee obligations to any third parties in respect of borrowed money,
in each case other than pursuant to the Financing.

_Section 2.04_ _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

(a) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each

Merger Sub, the performance by each of Trident, Fountain, AcquisitionCo and
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions, except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings
that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have,

understood that references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such Trident
Regulatory Approvals shall mean making such declarations, filings or

 _Section 2.05_ _Reports; Financial Information; Absence of Changes_. (a)
As of the date of this Agreement, neither Fountain nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or

(b) Section 2.05(b) of the Trident Disclosure Letter sets forth the draft
registration statement on Form 10 of Fountain substantially in the form that
such statement would have been filed with the SEC had the Merger not been
contemplated in accordance with this Agreement (the " _Draft Form 10_ "). As
of its draft date, the sections of the Draft Form 10 entitled "Risk Factors,"
"Selected Historical Combined Financial Data," "Managements

 



13  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"
"Business" and, other than with respect to any information or discussion
regarding the Other Transaction Agreements, "Certain Relationships and
Related Party Transactions" do not, solely with respect to the Fountain
Business, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(c) Trident has previously made available to Patriot:

(i) the audited combined balance sheets of the Fountain Business as of
September 24, 2010 and September 30, 2011, and the related audited combined
statements of income, cash flows and equity for the fiscal years ended
September 25, 2009, September 24, 2010 and September 30, 2011, including the
notes thereto (collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "); and

(ii) the unaudited interim combined balance sheet of the Fountain Business at
December 24, 2010 and December 30, 2011 and the related unaudited interim
combined statements of income, cash flows and equity for the three months
ended December 24, 2010 and December 30, 2011 (collectively, the " _Interim
Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Subsequent Interim Financial
Information and the Audited Financial Statements, the " _Fountain Financial
Statements_ ").

(d) The Fountain Financial Statements present fairly (or, in the case of the
Subsequent Interim Financial Information, will present fairly) in all
material respects the financial position of the Fountain Business as of the
dates thereof, and the results of operations and cash flows, changes in equity
or other information included therein for the periods or as of the dates then
ended, in each case except as otherwise noted therein (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as would be permitted by Regulation S-X and Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act). The Fountain Financial Statements have been (or, in
the case of the Subsequent Interim Financial Information, will be) prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods covered
(except with respect to the Interim Financial Statements and the Subsequent
Interim Financial Statements as would be permitted by Regulation S-X and Form
10-Q under the Exchange Act).

(e) (i) Trident has established, and Trident and Fountain maintain,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act), that satisfy the requirements of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act with respect to Persons subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Tridents
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information disclosed by Trident in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Tridents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required
pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") with respect to such filings. Trident is and has been
since September 24, 2010, in compliance in all

 



14  material respects with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable
to it and the certifications provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof
were accurate when made with respect to Trident and its Subsidiaries.
Tridents internal control over financial reporting is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Fountain Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.
Tridents management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Tridents internal control over financial reporting for the year ended
September 30, 2011 that satisfies the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to Persons subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

 

(ii) Trident has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Tridents
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Trident (A) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Tridents or Fountains ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Tridents or Fountains internal control over financial reporting.

(iii) Since September 24, 2010, to the Knowledge of Trident, (A) none
of Trident, Fountain or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any director,
officer, employee, auditor, accountant or similar representative of Trident,
Fountain or any of their respective Subsidiaries, has received any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Fountain or any Fountain Sub or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
Fountain or any Fountain Sub has engaged in improper accounting or auditing
practices, and (B) no attorney representing Trident, Fountain or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Trident, Fountain or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Fountain or any Fountain Sub or their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Trident or Fountain or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Trident or Fountain.

(f) Since September 30, 2011 to the date hereof, (i) except as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, the Fountain
Business has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices and (ii) there has not occurred a
Fountain Business MAE.

(g) Except for matters included in the audited combined balance sheet included
in the Audited Financial Statements of the Fountain Business as of September
30, 2011 (including the notes thereto), neither Trident nor any of its
Subsidiaries have any liabilities or obligations of any nature that would be
Fountain Liabilities and that would be required under GAAP, as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, to be reflected on a combined balance sheet of
the Fountain Business or in the notes thereto, except for liabilities and
obligations that (i) were incurred since September 30, 2011 and in the
ordinary course of business, (ii) are incurred in 

 



15  connection with the Transactions, (iii) are included in the unaudited
interim balance sheet included in the Interim Financial Statements of the
Fountain Business (including the notes thereto) as of December 30, 2011 or
(iv) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Fountain Business MAE.

_Section 2.06_ _Information to be Supplied_. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Trident, Fountain, AcquisitionCo or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Trident
Filings or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC shall, on
the date of its filing or, in the case of the Form S-4 or the Form 10, at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as
applicable, or on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the
Patriot shareholders or the Trident Proxy is mailed to Trident shareholders,
as applicable, at the time of the Patriot Shareholder Meeting or the Trident
Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, and on the Fountain Distribution Date, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

understood that references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such Patriot
Regulatory Approvals shall mean making such declarations, filings or
registrations; giving such notices; obtaining such final authorizations,
consents or approvals; and having such waiting periods expire as are necessary
to avoid a violation of Law).

 

 _Section 3.05_ _Patriot SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Absence of
Changes_. (a) Patriot has timely filed or furnished all registration
statements, prospectuses, forms, reports and documents and related exhibits
required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, since December 31, 2010 (the " _Patriot SEC
Filings_ "). The Patriot SEC Filings when filed or furnished with or to the
SEC (or, if amended or supplemented, then as of the time of its most recent
amendment or supplement (as applicable)) (i) complied or will comply, as
applicable, in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (ii) did not or will not, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of
Patriot is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

(b) (i) Patriot has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act), as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Patriots
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure that
all material information disclosed by Patriot in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Patriots management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to such filings.
Patriot is and has been since December 31, 2010, in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to it and
the certifications provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof were
accurate when made with respect to Patriot and its Subsidiaries. Neither
Patriot nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Patriots internal
control over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Patriots management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Patriots internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

(ii) Patriot has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to Patriots
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Patriot (A) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal

 



29  control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Patriots ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Patriots
internal control over financial reporting.

(iii) Since December 31, 2010, to the Knowledge of Patriot, (A) neither
Patriot nor any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or similar representative of Patriot or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Patriot or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Patriot
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper accounting or auditing
practices, and (B) no attorney representing Patriot or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors or Patriot or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of
Patriot.

 

(c) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Patriot (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) contained in the Patriot SEC Filings was
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods
covered (except with respect to unaudited interim financial statements as
would be permitted by Regulation S-X and Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act),
and each presented fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial
position and results of operations of Patriot and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as would be permitted by Regulation S-X and Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act).

(d) Except for matters included in the consolidated balance sheet of Patriot
as of the end of the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2011, including the
notes thereto, neither Patriot nor any of its Subsidiaries have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature that would be required under GAAP, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be included in a consolidated
balance sheet of Patriot and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in the
notes thereto, except for liabilities and obligations that (i) were incurred
since December 31, 2011 and in the ordinary course of business, (ii) are
incurred in connection with the Transactions or (iii) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Patriot MAE.

(e) Since December 31, 2011 to the date hereof, (i) there has not occurred a
Patriot MAE and (ii) Patriot has conducted its businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.

 

 _Section 3.06_ _Information to be Supplied_. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Patriot specifically for inclusion in the
Trident Filings or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC
shall, on the date of its filing or, in the case of the Form S-4 or the Form
10, at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act or Exchange
Act, as applicable, or on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to
the Patriot

 



30  shareholders or the Trident Proxy is mailed to Trident shareholders, as
applicable, at the time of the Patriot Shareholder Meeting or the Trident
Shareholder Meeting, as applicable, and on the Fountain Distribution Date, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to projected
financial information provided by or on behalf of Patriot (if any), Patriot
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith
by management of Patriot on the basis of assumptions believed by such
management to be reasonable as of the time made. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, except that no representation or warranty
is made by Patriot with respect to statements included or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Trident or
Fountain for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 

_Section 3.07_ _Voting Requirements; Approval; Board Approval_. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of Patriot Common Stock is the only vote of any class or
series of Patriots capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement, the
Other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the applicable
Transactions (the " _Patriot Shareholder Approval_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Board of Directors of Patriot has taken all requisite action to
ensure that the requisite shareholders vote to approve the Merger has been
decreased from two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
Patriot Common Stock to a majority. The Board of Directors of Patriot has
resolved to recommend, subject to the terms of this Agreement, that the
Patriot Shareholders approve this Agreement, the Other Transaction Agreements
and the Transactions (the " _Patriot Recommendation_ "), and such resolutions
have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn prior to the date hereof.

 

 _Section 3.08_ _Litigation_. There is no pending Action and to the
Knowledge of Patriot, no Person has threatened to commence any Action,
including any cease and desist letters or invitations to take a patent
license, against Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Assets,
rights or properties owned or used by any of them, in each case which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot
MAE. None of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective Assets,
rights and properties, is subject to any Order which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot MAE.

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot
MAE, the businesses of each of Patriot and its Subsidiaries is being
conducted, and since January 1, 2010 has been conducted, in compliance with
all applicable Laws and Orders. Since January 1, 2010, neither Patriot nor any
Subsidiary of Patriot has received any written notice or, to the Knowledge of
Patriot, other communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any
actual or possible violation (as yet unremedied) of, or failure to comply
with, any Law or Order, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot MAE. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 3.09(a), no representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made in this Section 3.09(a) in respect of Tax, employee
benefits, labor, intellectual property or environmental matters.

 



31 (b) Patriot and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications,
registrations and orders of any Governmental Authority, and all rights under
any Contract with any Governmental Authority, necessary for the conduct of
its respective business as such business is currently being conducted (the "
_Patriot Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Patriot
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Patriot MAE. All Patriot Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot
MAE. Patriot is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, and each of their respective
businesses as being conducted is, in compliance in all respects with the terms
and requirements of such Patriot Permits, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

legal, valid and binding or to be in full force and effect as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Patriot

Merger or the Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, reasonable
best efforts, including with respect to the matters contemplated by this
Section 5.01, shall not require Trident, any Trident Subsidiary, Patriot or
any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or accept any term or condition to any
Regulatory Approval, or any Regulatory Approval that includes terms or
conditions, if the terms and conditions of or to the Regulatory Approvals
would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse impact on
the value, financial condition or credit quality of Fountain and the Fountain
Subs, taken as a whole and including for such purposes Patriot and its
Subsidiaries.

_Section 5.02_ _Public Announcements_. Trident and Patriot agree that, from
the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or
termination of this Agreement, except in connection with a Patriot Change of
Recommendation or Trident Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.07 or Section 5.08, as applicable (or as otherwise expressly permitted by
such Sections), no release or announcement concerning this Agreement, the
Other Transaction Agreements or the Transactions shall be issued by Patriot or
Trident without the prior written consent of Trident or Patriot, respectively
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the regulations of any applicable securities exchange, in which case the Party
proposing to issue such release or make such announcement shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other Party
before issuing such release or making

 



51  any such announcement; _provided_ , that Trident may issue any such release
or announcement without prior Patriot consent or review to the extent such
release or announcement relates to either the Athens Separation or both the

shall be in the same format and prepared on the same basis as the comparable
portions of the Fountain Financial Statements, except as would be permitted by
Regulation S-X and Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act for unaudited interim
financial statements (the " _Subsequent Interim Financial Information_ ").

(b) Trident shall promptly, and in any event within 90 days of the date of
this Agreement, prepare and deliver to Patriot an unaudited combined balance
sheet as of September 30, 2011 of the Trident Group, prepared to give pro
forma effect to the Separation and the Distribution (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Athens Separation and the ADT Distribution (as
defined in the Separation Agreement)) and based on the principles set forth in
Section 5.03(b) of the Trident Disclosure Letter.

(c) Each of Patriot, Trident and Fountain agrees to cooperate in good faith in
order to obtain, from one or more third party financing sources, indebtedness
to be (x) incurred by Fountain and/or the Fountain Subs or (y) if mutually
agreed by the Parties, incurred by Trident and contributed to Fountain and/or
the Fountain Subs at or prior to the Closing (a " _Trident Financing_ "), in
each case in a principal amount equal to $500 million; _provided_ , that none
of Fountain, the Fountain Subs or Trident shall be required to (absent, in the
case of Fountain and/or the Fountain Subs, Tridents prior consent) incur any
such indebtedness unless the incurrence thereof is concurrent with and
subject to the Closing. Patriot shall be entitled to negotiate and, subject to
the proviso in the foregoing sentence, determine the terms of any such
indebtedness in its sole discretion, including any related credit agreements
and similar documents related thereto, and in connection therewith, each of
Trident and Fountain shall, subject to Section 5.03(d) and the proviso in the
foregoing sentence, enter into all necessary or appropriate arrangements
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper or advisable with respect thereto, in each case as may be reasonably
requested by Patriot. Patriot shall provide to Trident and Fountain copies of
all agreements relating to any such indebtedness and keep Trident and Fountain
reasonably informed of all material developments in respect thereof. Each of
Trident, Fountain and Patriot agree to allow the others accounting
representatives a reasonable opportunity to review any financial statements
required in connection therewith and to allow such representatives reasonable
access to the records of Fountain, the Fountain Subs and each other
Subsidiary of Trident, as appropriate, and of Patriot and each of its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, in connection therewith. Each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its outside auditors to participate in
the preparation of any pro forma financial statements necessary

 



52  or desirable for use in connection with obtaining any such indebtedness.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.03(b), Tridents
cooperation shall not include any requirement or obligation of Trident or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than Fountain and the Fountain Subs), and Patriots
cooperation shall not include any requirement or obligation of Patriot or any
of its Subsidiaries, in each case, to pay any consideration, extend any
credit, guaranty any performance, payment or other obligation, incur any
financial obligation, offer or grant any financial accommodation or other
benefit, release any claim or incur any other liability whatsoever (in each
case other than fees and disbursements of outside counsel and any other
advisors), except, (1) in the case of Patriot, for any such action the
effectiveness of which is expressly conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Closing and (2) in the case of a Trident Financing, for any such requirement
and/or obligation that is incurred at the time such Trident Financing is
consummated and that is released upon contribution of such indebtedness to
Fountain.

 

(d) If, following the Parties compliance with the provisions of Section
5.03(b), Patriot is unable to obtain prior to the Closing third party
indebtedness to be incurred by Fountain and/or the Fountain Subs on Acceptable
Terms, then, immediately prior to the Distribution, at Tridents discretion,
either (i) Fountain or a Fountain Sub shall issue to Trident or a Subsidiary
of Trident, as directed by Trident, the Bridge Note or (ii) Trident and
Fountain shall modify existing intercompany indebtedness of members of the
Fountain Group owed to members of the Trident Group, as selected by Trident
and approved by Patriot (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) to provide that (x) such intercompany indebtedness
shall be in a principal amount equal to $500 million and shall otherwise be on
terms consistent with the terms of the Bridge Note and (y) notwithstanding
any provisions of the Separation Agreement to the contrary, such indebtedness
shall survive the Closing.

(e) For purposes of this Section 5.03:

(i) " _Acceptable Terms_ " means terms no less favorable to Fountain and the
Fountain Subs (including Patriot and its Subsidiaries) than those set forth in
Section 5.03(e)(i) of the Patriot Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,
that Patriot may, in its sole discretion, elect to accept any less favorable
terms but it shall be under no obligation to do so.

(ii) " _Bridge Note_ " means a bridge note on the terms set forth in Section
5.03(e)(ii) of the Patriot Disclosure Letter.

 

 _Section 5.04_ _Access_. From the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective
Time or the Termination Date, to the extent permitted by Law, each of Trident
and Patriot shall allow all designated Representatives of Trident or Patriot,
as the case may be, access at reasonable times upon reasonable notice and in a
manner as shall not adversely impact the conduct of the business of either
Party or the Fountain Business in any material respect to the personnel, books
and records, files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all
information relating to commitments, Contracts, titles,
insurance, operational data, results of operations, and financial position,
or otherwise pertaining primarily to the business and affairs of the Fountain
Business and Patriot and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall
modify or qualify any representation or warranty given by any

 



53  Party hereunder and (ii) notwithstanding the provision of information or
investigation by any Party, no Party shall be deemed to make any
representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no Party shall be required to provide any
information which it determines in good faith it may not provide to the other
Party by reason of applicable Law (including any information in confidential
personnel files), which such Party determines in good faith constitutes
information protected by attorney/client privilege or which it is required to
keep confidential by reason of Contracts with third parties and (B) no
Party shall be required to provide access to any of its properties if such
access would result in damage to such property or if such access is for the
purpose of performing any onsite procedure or investigation (including any
Phase II or other intrusive onsite environmental investigation or study but
not including any Phase I environmental investigation or other environmental
investigation that does not include any sampling or testing), without that
Partys written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Parties shall make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable, under
circumstances in which the restrictions in clauses (A) and (B) of the
preceding sentence apply. Each of Trident and Patriot agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.04 for any purpose unrelated
to the Transactions and operation of the Fountain Business.

_Section 5.05_ _Preparation of SEC Filings_. (a) As promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, to the extent such filings are required
by applicable Law (i) Trident, Fountain and Patriot shall jointly prepare, and
Patriot shall file with the SEC, a proxy statement/prospectus (such

be mailed to Patriots shareholders in connection with the Patriot
Shareholder Approval, (ii) Trident, Fountain and Patriot shall jointly

prepare and file such other appropriate documents with the SEC as may be
applicable.

its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trident Proxy to be mailed to
Tridents shareholders, and Patriot shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Patriots
shareholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable after the

qualified) required to be taken under applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Fountain Common Stock in the Distribution or
the Merger.

 



54 (c) Trident shall furnish all information concerning Trident, Fountain,
AcquisitionCo and Merger Sub and the Fountain Business and the Surviving

Statement/Prospectus shall be made by Patriot, no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Form 10 shall be made by Fountain and no
change, as it relates to the Transactions, shall be made by Trident to the
Trident Proxy, in each case without providing the other Parties a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon.

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Trident or Patriot or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors (or the Patriot Board Appointees) should be discovered by Trident or
Patriot which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4, the Form 10 or the Trident Proxy, so
that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the applicable
Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the applicable shareholders.

(e) The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff

supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,

Trident Shareholder Approval.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.06, Patriot and
Trident shall cooperate in good faith to coordinate the timing of the Patriot
Shareholder Meeting and the Trident Shareholder Meeting such that they occur
on the same day, and neither Patriot nor Trident shall be required to hold the
Patriot Shareholder Meeting or the Trident Shareholder Meeting, respectively,
prior to the date of the date of the Trident Shareholder Meeting or the
Patriot Shareholder Meeting, respectively (it being understood that nothing in
this Section 5.06(c) shall in any way limit Patriots or
Tridents obligations under Section 5.05 or otherwise under this Agreement to
use their respective required efforts to consummate the Transactions
(including the Separation and Distribution)).

 

 _Section 5.07_ _No Solicitation by Patriot_. (a) Patriot agrees that,
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the Termination Date, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees,
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to (and shall not authorize or permit
its and their respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or the making, submission, announcement or consummation of any
Patriot Takeover Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding
Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Trident) in
connection with or in response to a Patriot Takeover Proposal, (iii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Trident) with respect to any Patriot Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse
or recommend any Patriot Takeover Proposal or propose publicly to approve,
endorse or recommend any Patriot Takeover Proposal, (v) enter into any letter
of intent, agreement in principle or other agreement providing for any
Patriot Takeover Transaction, (vi) take any action to make the provisions of
any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business

Transaction, (vii) take any

 



56  action to make the consummation of any Patriot Takeover Proposal exempt
under the terms of the Rights Agreement or (viii) resolve, propose to resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
receipt of the Patriot Shareholder Approval, Patriot may, in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide, written Patriot Takeover Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.07(a) and that the Board of Directors of
Patriot determines, in good faith, after consulting with its independent
financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be likely to lead to a
Patriot Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information (including non-
public information) with respect to Patriot and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Patriot Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and (y)
engage in discussions and negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Patriot Takeover Proposal if, and only if, (1)
the Board of Directors of Patriot concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action with
respect to such Patriot Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with the
Boards duties under applicable Laws, (2) Patriot complies with Section
5.07(c) and (3) Patriot furnishes any non-public information provided to the
maker of such Patriot Takeover Proposal only pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement between Patriot and such Person on terms no less favorable in any
material respect to Patriot than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) the terms of such confidentiality agreement shall not in
any way restrict Patriot from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement, including disclosure obligations with respect to such proposal, and
(B) all such information has previously been provided to Trident or is
provided to Trident prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person).

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.07(b), neither the Board
of Directors of Patriot nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to include
the Patriot Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the Patriot Recommendation in a manner adverse to Trident
(it being understood that any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be
deemed a withholding, withdrawal, qualification or modification of the Patriot
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Trident) or (iii) approve, adopt or
recommend any Patriot Takeover Proposal (each such action set forth in
clauses (i) through (iii) above being a " _Patriot Change of Recommendation_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Patriot
Shareholder Approval, (x) the Board of Directors of Patriot receives a
Patriot Superior Proposal or (y) in response to an Intervening Event the Board
of Directors of Patriot determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action with respect
to such Intervening Event would constitute a breach of the Boards duties
under applicable Laws, then the Board of Directors of Patriot may make a
Patriot Change of Recommendation and/or, in the case of clause (x), terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(iii); _provided_ , that (1) in the
case of clause (x), Patriot has not violated Section 5.07(a) in any material
respect (it being understood that terminating this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(f)(iii) in order to enter into a written definitive agreement
for a Patriot Superior Proposal shall not be deemed a violation of Section
5.07(a)), (2) prior to taking any such action the Board of Directors of
Patriot has provided to Trident three Business Days prior written notice of
its intent to effect a Patriot Change of Recommendation or, in the case of
clause (x), terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(iii) (which
notice shall include the reasonable details regarding the cause for, and
nature of, the Patriot Change of Recommendation or proposed termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(iii)) and, if requested by Trident
in good faith, negotiated in good 

 



57  faith with Trident during such three Business Day period to enable Trident
to propose changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause, as
applicable, such Patriot Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Patriot
Superior Proposal or such Intervening Event to no longer require the Patriot
Change of Recommendation, in each case if such changes were to be given
effect, and (3) following any such good faith negotiation, such Patriot
Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Patriot Superior Proposal or such
Intervening Event continues to require the Patriot Change of Recommendation;
and _provided further_ that if any Patriot Superior Proposal is received
less than three Business Days prior the Patriot Shareholder Meeting, the
three Business Day period contemplated by the proviso above shall be shortened
such that it will expire as of the close of business on the day preceding the
Patriot Shareholder Meeting. The Board of Directors of Patriot may not make a
Patriot Change of Recommendation in a manner adverse to Trident except in
compliance in all respects with this Section 5.07(b). For the avoidance of
doubt, a change of the Patriot Recommendation to "neutral" is a Patriot
Change of Recommendation. Except as permitted by Section 7.01(f)(iii), nothing
in this Section 5.07(b) shall be deemed to modify or otherwise affect the
obligation of Patriot to call the Patriot Shareholders Meeting and to submit
this Agreement and the Merger to the Patriot shareholders for approval in
accordance with Section 5.06(a).

(c) Patriot promptly, and in no event later than 48 hours after its receipt of
any Patriot Takeover Proposal, shall advise Trident orally and in writing of
any Patriot Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such
Patriot Takeover Proposal and (x) if it is in writing, deliver to Trident a
copy of such Patriot Takeover Proposal and any related draft agreements
(subject to customary redactions in the case of any financing commitments)
and (y) if oral, deliver to Trident a reasonably detailed summary of any such
Patriot Takeover Proposal. Patriot shall (i) keep Trident reasonably informed
in all material respects on a prompt basis of the status, including any
change to the status or material terms, of any such Patriot Takeover Proposal
(and in no event later than 48 hours following any such change) and (ii)
promptly notify Trident of any determination of the Board of Directors of
Patriot that a Patriot Takeover Proposal constitutes a Patriot Superior
Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section 5.07
shall not prohibit Patriot from taking and disclosing to the Patriot
Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Patriot Takeover
Proposal or otherwise making a disclosure required by applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such rules or Law shall not in
any way modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules or Law
has under any other provision of this Agreement (it being understood that any
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be deemed a withholding,
withdrawal, qualification or modification of the Patriot Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Trident).

(e) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Patriot shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions existing
as of the date of this Agreement between Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives and
any Person (other than Trident and Fountain) that relate to any
Patriot Takeover Proposal and, to the

 



58  extent provided by the applicable confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement governing such discussions, require any Person or "Group" (as
defined in the Exchange Act) to such discussions to return to Patriot or to
destroy all confidential information of Patriot and its Subsidiaries. Patriot
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, waive, or otherwise
release any Person or "Group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) from, the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Patriot or
any of its Subsidiaries is or may become a party.

(f) As used in this Agreement:

(i) " _Patriot Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest (other than an offer, inquiry, proposal or
indication of interest by a Party to this Agreement) received from a Person or
"Group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) relating to any Patriot Takeover
Transaction;

(ii) " _Patriot Takeover Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or series
of related transactions involving: (A) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, recapitalization, business combination or similar transaction
involving Patriot other than the Transactions; (B) any direct or indirect
acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction in which a Person or "Group" (as defined in the Exchange Act)
directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities
representing 10% or more of any class of equity securities of Patriot; (C) any
direct or indirect acquisition of any business or businesses or of Assets that
constitute or account for 10% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or Assets of Patriot and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (D) any
liquidation or dissolution of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries; and

 

(iii) " _Patriot Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide proposal made
by a Person or "Group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) (other than a Party
to this Agreement) to acquire at least a majority of the equity securities or
all or substantially all of the Assets of Patriot, pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a
recapitalization, a sale of Assets or otherwise, on terms which the Board of
Directors of Patriot determines in its good faith judgment (A) after
consulting with its independent financial advisor to be superior from a
financial point of view to the holders of Patriot Common Stock to the
Transactions (including any proposed modifications to the Transactions which
are proposed in writing by Trident in response to such proposal or
otherwise) and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on its terms,
taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects (including
certainty of closing) of the proposal and the Person or "Group" (as defined in
the Exchange Act) making the proposal.

_Section 5.08_ _No Solicitation by Trident_. (a) Trident and Fountain
agree that, following the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the Termination Date, neither they nor any of their
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees,
shall, and that they shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives not to (and shall not authorize or permit their
respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,

knowingly take any other action designed to

 



59  facilitate any inquiries or the making, submission, announcement or
consummation of any Fountain Takeover Proposal or any Trident Takeover
Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding Trident or any

only if, (1) the Board of Directors of Trident concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action with respect to such Fountain Takeover Proposal or Trident Takeover
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Boards duties under applicable Laws,
(2) Trident complies with Section 5.08(c) and (3) Trident furnishes any non-
public information provided to the maker of such Fountain Takeover Proposal or
Trident Takeover Proposal only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement between
Trident and such Person on terms no less favorable in any material respect to

to taking any such action the Board of Directors of Trident has provided to
Patriot three Business Days prior written notice of its intent to effect a
Trident Change of Recommendation (which notice shall include the reasonable
details regarding the cause for, and nature of, the Trident Change of
Recommendation) and, if requested by Patriot in good faith, negotiated in good
faith with Patriot during such three Business Day period to enable Patriot to
propose changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause, as

Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the

shareholders who are U.S. persons and are or will be "five-percent transferee
shareholders" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

Code, (ii) the Anticipated Post-Closing Transactions will not prevent the
qualification of the Distribution or the Merger for the Intended Tax-Free
Treatment and (iii) the Merger will qualify as a reorganization pursuant to

(f) Each Party represents that the information and representations furnished
by it in or with respect to the Rulings or the Tax Opinions are accurate and
complete as of the Closing Date. Each Party covenants (i) to use its
reasonable best efforts, and to cause its Affiliates to use their reasonable
best efforts, to verify that such information and representations are
accurate and complete as of the Closing Date and (ii) if, after the Closing
Date, it or any of its Affiliates obtains information indicating, or otherwise
becomes aware, that any such information or representation is or may be
inaccurate or incomplete, to promptly inform the other Parties. The Parties
shall not take any action or fail to take any action, or permit any of their
Affiliates to take any action or fail to take any action, that is or is
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Ruling or the Tax Opinions.

_Section 5.11_ _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) For a period of 12
months following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), each of
the Parties covenants and agrees that Fountain and the Fountain Subs,

_Trident Continuing Employees_ ") a salary or hourly wage rate and cash and
long-term equity incentive target opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the
Closing with respect to each such Trident Continuing Employee to the extent
such Trident Continuing Employee remains employed by Fountain or the Fountain
Subs; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms and conditions of employment of
any employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall be governed by
such agreement in accordance with its terms. During the Continuation Period,
with respect to Trident Continuing Employees, each of the Parties covenants
and agrees that Fountain and the Fountain Subs, including Patriot and its
Subsidiaries, shall honor and maintain, for the benefit of Trident Continuing
Employees, the Fountain Benefit Plans (including all severance benefits and
similar plans, programs or arrangements) in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Fountain Distribution Date. Patriot and
Fountain shall undertake those actions set forth in Section 5.11(a) of the
Patriot Disclosure Letter.

(b) With respect to each compensation or benefit plan sponsored or otherwise
maintained by Fountain or any Fountain Sub, including Patriot and its
Subsidiaries, after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation
entitlement, service with Trident or any of its Subsidiaries by a Trident
Continuing Employee shall be treated as service with the entity sponsoring
such plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.
Such service also shall apply for purposes

 



65  of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations with respect to any
such ongoing plan. Each such ongoing plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the same extent waived under the corresponding Fountain Benefit
Plan or Patriot Benefit Plan. Trident Continuing Employees shall be given
credit, to the extent administratively feasible, for amounts paid under a
corresponding Fountain Benefit Plan or Patriot Benefit Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the ongoing plan during the applicable plan year.

(c) Notwithstanding the forgoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment to any Fountain Benefit Plan or Patriot Benefit Plan,
(ii) give any person other than the Parties the right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 5.11 or (iii) obligate any of the Parties to (x)
maintain any Fountain Benefit Plan or Patriot Benefit Plan or any other
particular compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or understanding or
(y) retain the employment of any particular employee of any of the Parties.

extent as if such Person was a Party. None of Trident, Fountain or Patriot or
their respective Subsidiaries shall settle any Action related to the
Transactions that would enjoin, restrain, prohibit or impose damages on
Fountain or the Fountain Subs without the prior written consent of Patriot and
Trident, in each case not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

material respect any covenant, condition or agreement that could be complied
with or satisfied by it at such time under this Agreement, or which has
resulted, or which, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would result, in

related to the separation of the Fountain Business from the Trident Retained
Business (as defined in the Separation Agreement) shall not be construed as a
prerequisite of any subsequent step or action which is directly related to the
separation of the Fountain Business from the Trident Retained Business and
the failure to occur of any prior step or action not directly related to the
separation of the Fountain Business from the Trident Retained Business shall
have no effect on any Parties obligation to undertake any subsequent step or

75  clause (ii) above such payment shall be made concurrently with or prior to
such termination and in the case of termination pursuant to clause (iii) above
such payment shall be made on the date of execution of such definitive
agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions). Patriot shall
not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this Section
8.02(e). Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
obligations contained in this Section 8.02(e) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these covenants
and obligations, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and
that the Patriot Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Trident and Fountain in
the circumstances in which such Patriot Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Upon payment of the Patriot Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 8.02(e), none of Patriot or any of its respective former, current or
future Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability to
Trident, Fountain, AcquisitionCo or Merger Sub or their respective
shareholders with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. In the event
that Patriot shall fail to pay when due the Patriot Termination Fee required
to be paid by it pursuant to this Section 8.02(e), such Patriot Termination
Fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such Patriot
Termination Fee becomes past due, at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the
prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal plus (ii) 4.0% per annum, calculated on a daily basis until the
date of actual payment. In addition, if Patriot shall fail to pay the Patriot
Termination Fee when due, Patriot shall also pay to Trident all of Tridents
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with
efforts to collect such amount.

 

(f) _Trident Termination Fees_. Trident shall pay to Patriot a fee of $145
million (the " _Fountain Takeover Termination Fee_ ") as liquidated damages
if: (i) Patriot terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(iv) as a
result of a Trident Change of Recommendation in connection with a Fountain
Takeover Proposal or a Trident Change of Recommendation pursuant to clause
(ii) thereof not related to a Trident Takeover Proposal; or (ii) (A) any
Person makes (1) a Fountain Takeover Proposal or (2) a Trident Takeover
Proposal that was publicly disclosed, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Fountain
Takeover Proposal or Trident Takeover Proposal (and such Fountain Takeover
Proposal or Trident Takeover Proposal or such announcement of an intention to
make a Fountain Takeover Proposal or Trident Takeover Proposal is not publicly
withdrawn at the time of such termination) more than five days prior to the
Trident Shareholder Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is terminated
by Trident or Patriot either pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), or by Patriot pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(i) as a result of a
breach by Trident of its obligations under Section 5.08(a) of this Agreement,
and (B) within 12 months following such termination Trident enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a Fountain Takeover
Proposal or, in the case of clause (ii)(A)(1), a Trident Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , that for purposes of clause (ii) of this sentence of Section
8.02(f), the references to "10%" in the definition of Fountain Takeover
Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "50%". Further, Trident shall
pay to Patriot a fee of $370 million (the " _Trident Takeover Termination
Fee_ " and, together with the Fountain Takeover Termination Fee, the "
_Trident Termination Fees_ ") as liquidated damages if: (i) Patriot terminates
this 

 



76  Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(iv) as a result of a Trident Change of
Recommendation (other than a Trident Change of Recommendation in connection
with a Fountain Takeover Proposal or a Trident Change of Recommendation
pursuant to clause (ii) thereof not related to a Fountain Takeover Proposal or
a Trident Takeover Proposal); or (ii) (A) any Person makes a Trident Takeover
Proposal that was publicly disclosed, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Trident Takeover
Proposal (and such Trident Takeover Proposal or such announcement of an
intention to make a Trident Takeover Proposal is not publicly withdrawn at
the time of such termination) more than five days prior to the Trident
Shareholder Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Trident or
Patriot either pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or pursuant to Section 7.01(e), or
by Patriot pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(i) as a result of a breach by Trident
of its obligations under Section 5.08(a) of this Agreement, and (B) within 12
months following such termination Trident enters into a definitive agreement
to consummate, or consummates, a Trident Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that
(1) for purposes of clause (ii) of this sentence of Section 8.02(f), the
references to "10%" in the definition of Trident Takeover Transaction shall
be deemed to be references to "50%" and (2) for purposes of clause (ii)(B) of
this Section 8.02(f), a Trident Takeover Proposal shall not be required to be
expressly conditioned on the Transactions not being consummated. Any Trident
Termination Fee due under this Section 8.02(f) shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (to an account specified by Patriot) promptly
following termination of the Agreement (except that in the case
of termination pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section
8.02(f) or clause (ii) of the second sentence of this Section 8.02(f), such
payment shall be made on the date of execution of such definitive agreement
or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions). For the avoidance of
doubt, Patriot shall not in any event receive both the Trident Termination Fee
and the Fountain Termination Fee. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the covenants and obligations contained in this Section 8.02(f) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these covenants and obligations, the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement and that the Trident Termination Fees are not a penalty,
but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Patriot in the circumstances in which any such Trident Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Upon payment of any Trident Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 8.02(f), none of Trident, Fountain, AcquisitionCo
or Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability to Patriot or
its shareholders with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. In the
event that Trident shall fail to pay when due any Trident Termination Fee
required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section 8.02(f), such Trident
Termination Fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the date
such Trident Termination Fee becomes past due, at a rate equal to the sum of
(i) the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The
Wall Street Journal plus (ii) 4.0% per annum, calculated on a daily basis
until the date of actual payment. In addition, if Trident shall fail to pay
any Trident Termination Fee when due, Trident shall also pay to Patriot all
of Patriots costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with efforts to collect such amount.

 



77 _Section 8.03_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Other Transaction Agreements, including any
related annexes, schedules and exhibits, as well as any other agreements and
documents referred to herein and therein, shall together constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and shall supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and
understandings of the Parties of any nature, whether oral or written, with
respect to such subject matter. If there is a conflict between any provision
of this Agreement and a provision of the Other Transaction Agreements, the
provision of this Agreement shall control unless specifically provided
otherwise in this Agreement.

 

 _Section 8.04_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with (a) the laws of the State of Minnesota with
respect to matters, issues and questions relating to the duties of the Board
of Directors of Patriot or Merger Sub or to general corporation law including
requirements for the validity of the Merger and (b) the laws of the State of
New York with respect to all other matters, issues and questions, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

_Section 8.05_   _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. The Parties understand
and agree that (a) the covenants and agreements on each of their parts herein
contained are uniquely related to the desire of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates to consummate the Transactions, (b) the Transactions
are a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of Trident and
Patriot and their respective Affiliates, (c) irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms, (d) although monetary damages may be
available for the breach of such covenants and agreements including pursuant
to Section 8.02(e) and Section 8.02(f), such monetary damages are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result
from a breach of this Agreement, would be an inadequate remedy therefor and
shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
partys right to specific performance and (e) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right none of the parties would have entered into
this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages, each of the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement exclusively in any New York State or federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York (or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York State or federal court located
within the State of New York). Each of the Parties further agrees that no
Party to this Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond
or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 8.05 and each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in any New York State or federal
court sitting in the

 



78  Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York (or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York State or federal court located
within the State of New York). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits
with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this Section 8.05, (b) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

_Section 8.06_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have

or to such other address(es) as shall be furnished in writing by any such
Party to the other Party in accordance with the provisions of this Section
8.07. Any notice to Trident shall be deemed notice to all members of the
Trident Group, and any notice to Fountain shall be deemed notice to all
members of the Fountain Group.

 

 _Section 8.08_ _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) This Agreement may be amended
and any provision of this Agreement may be waived; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such waiver shall be binding upon a Party only if such waiver is set
forth in a writing executed by such Party and any such amendment shall be
effective only if set forth in a writing executed by each of the Parties. No
course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this
Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of
this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason
of this Agreement.

(b) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or remedy. The rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise have.
Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character of any 

 



82  breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision
of this Agreement must satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.08(a) and
shall be effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.

_Section 8.09_ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the Parties and does not confer on third parties (including any
employees of any member of the Trident Group or the Fountain Group) any
remedy, claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other right in addition to
those existing without reference to this Agreement.

_Section 8.10_ _Assignability; Binding Effect_. This Agreement is not
assignable by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties
and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent shall be void
and of no effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

_Section 8.11_   _Construction; Interpretation_. Headings of the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall
be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of
contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement or the Trident
Disclosure Letter or Patriot Disclosure Letter shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of
nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. Reference
to any agreement, document or instrument means such agreement, document
or instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
word "or" shall not be exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase does not simply mean "if". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All references to any period of days shall be to the relevant number of
calendar days unless otherwise specified. All references to dollars or $ shall
be references to United States dollars. All accounting terms shall have their
respective meanings under GAAP. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Other Transaction
Agreements. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, "consistent with
past practice" when used with respect to Fountain or any of its Subsidiaries
means the past practice of Trident with respect to the Fountain Business.

 

 _Section 8.12_ _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



83 _Section 8.13_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one Party), each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement,
and any amendments hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party
shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting
Party. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or other
electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or other
electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such
Party forever waives any such defense.

_Section 8.14_ _Disclosure Letters_. There may be included in the Trident
Disclosure Letter and/or the Patriot Disclosure Letter items and information
that are not "material," and such inclusion shall not be deemed (x) to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or (y) to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of
this Agreement. No information contained in this Agreement or in the
Trident Disclosure Letter and/or Patriot Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
be an admission by any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever
(including any violation of Law or breach of contract). Matters reflected in
the Trident Disclosure Letter or Patriot Disclosure Letter are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed
therein. The Trident Disclosure Letter and Patriot Disclosure Letter set forth
items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the Trident
Disclosure Letter or Patriot Disclosure Letter, as applicable, relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one Section of
such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.
