_Patriot_ ").

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Green, Merger Sub and Patriot have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination
transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into
Patriot (the " _Merger_ "), so that Patriot is the surviving corporation in
the Merger and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Green, and (ii) immediately
thereafter, Patriot will merge (the " _Second-Step Merger_ ", and together
with the Merger, the " _Integrated Mergers_ ") with and into Green, with Green
being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such
capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and within the meaning of
Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g);

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Greens willingness to enter into this Agreement,
certain shareholders of Patriot have each entered into a support agreement
with Green in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (collectively, the "
_Patriot Support Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Patriots willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain shareholders of Green have each entered into a voting
agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (collectively, the "
_Green Support Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Greens willingness to enter into this Agreement,
certain individuals have each entered into their respective employment
agreement with Green and/or Green Bank, each set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto,
which shall become automatically effective as of the Effective Time (such
agreements collectively, the " _New Employment Agreements_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

      
 

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with applicable law including the Texas Business Organizations Code
(the " _TBOC_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
Patriot. Patriot shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Texas. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall terminate.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the
Texas Secretary of State (the " _Texas Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date. The
term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the TBOC.

 



 

1.4 _Conversion of Patriot Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Green, Merger Sub or Patriot
or the holder of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value $0.50
per share, of Patriot issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Patriot Common Stock_ "), except for (i) shares of
Patriot Common Stock owned by Patriot as treasury stock or owned by Patriot or
Green (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted) and (ii) any shares held by Dissenting
Shareholders (as defined below), shall be converted into the right to receive
a number of shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Green
(the " _Green Common Stock_ ") equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration
_divided by_ the Exchangeable Shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such
shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Exchange Ratio shall be expressed
as a number rounded to the nearest four decimal points.

 



 

(b) All of the shares of Patriot Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Green Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it
being understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Patriot Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of
Patriot Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i)
a certificate (or evidence of book-entry as determined by Green in its sole
discretion) representing the number of whole shares of Green Common Stock
which such shares of Patriot Common Stock have been converted into the

 



      
 

 



 

right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
Patriot Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e), without
any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates
previously representing shares of Patriot Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of Green Common Stock (together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If,
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Green Common Stock or
Patriot Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Patriot Common Stock that are owned by Patriot
or Green (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no stock of Green or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

1.5 _Green Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of (i)
capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the surviving corporation in the
Merger and (ii) Green Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



 

1.6 _Determination of Exchange Ratio_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 



 

(i) " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to 10,757,273 shares
of Green Common Stock; _provided_ that the Aggregate Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted downward by 0.0824 shares of Green Common Stock for (1) each
dollar of cash payable in respect of Patriot Stock Options (as defined below)
pursuant to Section 1.7(a), and (2) each dollar the Final Adjusted TBV (as
defined below) is less than the amount shown on _Schedule 1.6(a)(i)_ for the
month-end with respect to which Adjusted TBV is measured.

 



 

(ii) " _Exchangeable Shares_ " means the aggregate number of shares of Patriot
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including any shares of Patriot Common Stock underlying Patriot Restricted
Stock Awards and any shares of Patriot Common Stock issued in connection with
the conversion of all of Patriots outstanding Series D Preferred Stock and
Series F Preferred Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) " _Patriot Stock Plans_ " means each plan listed on _Section
1.6(a)(iii)_ of the Patriot Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(iv) " _Per Patriot Share Cash Consideration_ " means the product of (1) the
Exchange Ratio times (2) the average of the closing sale prices of Green
Common Stock on the NASDAQ as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ for the
ten (10) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 1.6(b)_ sets forth a summary consolidated balance sheet of
Patriot and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015 (the " _Preliminary Closing
Statement_ "), which is derived from the Balance Sheet described in Section
3.6(a) and prepared, with respect to the calculation of Book Value (as defined
below) and Tangible Book Value (as defined below), in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently
applied. The Preliminary Closing Statement shall set forth (1) the
consolidated common shareholders equity of Patriot and its Subsidiaries (for
a given date, the " _Book Value_ ") as of March 31, 2015, (2) as of March 31,
2015, the consolidated tangible common shareholders equity of Patriot and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Tangible Book Value_ "), which for a given date shall be
equal to the Book Value as of such date, less goodwill, core deposit
intangibles and other intangible assets (if any), (3) to the extent not
already reflected in the Tangible Book Value whether or not required under
GAAP, the sum of (x) all professional fees and expenses, including legal,
accounting and investment banking fees and expenses, any supplemental

and/or severance expenses, any transaction-related success fees, the costs and
expenses related to the purchase of the DandO Tail (as defined below), all costs
associated with the termination of the Patriot Employment Agreement (as
defined below) and SERP Plan (as defined below), and any other transaction-
related costs and expenses, in each case, incurred or expected to be incurred
by Patriot, its Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (y) fifty
percent (50%) of the fees, expenses and other costs of the Neutral Auditor as
contemplated by Section 1.6(g) below (if any), in the case of each of clauses
(x) and (y) on an after-tax basis subject to Schedule 1.6(b) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, without duplication (collectively, the " _Transaction
Expenses_ "), and (4) as of March 31, 2015 the " _Adjusted TBV_ ", which, for
a given date, shall equal (i) the Tangible Book Value as of such date, _plus_
(ii) to the extent not already reflected in the Tangible Book Value, the
increase in the common shareholders equity of Patriot as a result of the
conversion of the Series D and Series F preferred stock, _less_ (iii) to the
extent not already reflected in the Tangible Book Value whether or not
required under GAAP, the Transaction Expenses incurred as of such date and/or
anticipated to be incurred through the Closing Date; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Patriot shall following the date of this Agreement
continue to accrue for dividends in respect of Patriots outstanding
cumulative preferred stock through the date of redemption or conversion, as
applicable, of such outstanding cumulative preferred stock.

 



 

(c) Not later than ten (10) days after each month-end during the period from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Patriot shall prepare in
good faith and deliver to Green an updated Preliminary Closing Statement as of
such month-end (each such statement, an " _Interim Closing Statement_ "). Each
such Interim Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the Preliminary Closing Statement and each earlier Interim

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Statement and shall set forth Patriots estimate of the Book Value and
the Tangible Book Value as of such month-end, a breakdown of the Transaction
Expenses incurred as of such month-end and/or anticipated to be incurred
through the Closing Date and the Adjusted TBV resulting therefrom. In the
event Green disputes any part of any Interim Closing Statement (including the
Adjusted TBV stated therein), it shall give prompt notice to Patriot of such
disputed item or items and Patriot and Green shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve such dispute as promptly as possible.

 



 

(d) Not later than ten (10) business days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Patriot shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Green an updated
Preliminary Closing Statement as of the month-end immediately preceding the
anticipated Closing Date (such statement, the " _Final Closing Statement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing Date is anticipated to occur in
the first ten (10) days of a calendar month, then the Final Closing Statement
shall be prepared as of the month-end of the earlier preceding month ( _i.e._
, if the Closing Date is anticipated to occur on August 1, then the Final
Closing Statement shall be prepared as of June 30). Such Final Closing
Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Preliminary
Closing Statement and the Interim Closing Statements and shall set forth the
Book Value and the Tangible Book Value as of the month-end immediately
preceding the anticipated Closing Date (or the prior month-end, if
applicable), a breakdown of the Transaction Expenses incurred as of such
month-end and/or anticipated to be incurred through the Closing Date and the
Adjusted TBV resulting therefrom (such Adjusted TBV, the " _Final Adjusted
TBV_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, a " _business day_ " shall be any
day, other than a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which national banks in
Houston, Texas are required or permitted to be closed.

 



 

(e) Subject to applicable law, Green shall have the right to review, and shall
have reasonable access to, all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and
other documents prepared by Patriot or its Subsidiaries or their respective
accountants in connection with Patriots preparation of the Preliminary
Closing Statement, the Interim Closing Statements and the Final Closing
Statement, as well as to executive, finance and accounting personnel of
Patriot or its Subsidiaries and any other information which Green may
reasonably request in connection with its review of the Preliminary Closing
Statement, the Interim Closing Statements and the Final Closing Statement;
_provided_ that Patriot and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide
Green access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would reasonably be expected to waive the protection of any privilege or the
work product doctrine. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



 

(f) In the event Green disputes the Final Closing Statement (including the
Final Adjusted TBV), Green shall, within five (5) business days following the
delivery of the Final Closing Statement, give Patriot written notice of its
objections thereto (the " _Objection Notice_ "), describing the nature of the
dispute in reasonable detail and specifying those items and amounts as to
which Green disagrees and, based on the information at its disposal,
specifying Greens good faith proposed calculation of Final Adjusted TBV. If
Green does not timely deliver an Objection Notice within such five (5)
business day period, the Final Adjusted TBV set forth in the Final Closing
Statement delivered by Patriot shall be utilized for the calculation of

 



      
 

 



 

the Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a) above and,
absent fraud, shall be final and binding on all the parties. Any items or
amounts set forth in the Final Closing Statement as to which Green does not
specifically and timely disagree in the manner set forth above shall be final
and binding on all the parties, absent fraud.

 



 

(g) If Green timely delivers an Objection Notice, Green and Patriot shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Green and Patriot cannot resolve the dispute within five (5) business days
after the date of the Objection Notice (the " _Initial Resolution Period_ "),
Green and Patriot shall appoint KPMG, LLP, or if KPMG, LLP is unwilling or
unable to serve in such capacity, such other mutually acceptable independent
accounting firm of national or regional reputation (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ")
to arbitrate the dispute under the rules the Neutral Auditor imposes. The
Neutral Auditor shall be limited to addressing only the particular disputes
referred to in the Objection Notice, and the Neutral Auditors resolution of
any disputed item shall be no greater than the higher amount, and no less than
the lower amount, calculated or proposed by Green and Patriot with respect to
such disputed item, as the case may be. Upon reaching its determination of the
Final Adjusted TBV, the Neutral Auditor shall deliver a copy of its
calculation of the Final Adjusted TBV to Green and Patriot. The determination
of the Neutral Auditor shall be made within twenty (20) days after its
engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five (5) days after
the end of the Initial Resolution Period) and, absent fraud, shall be final
and binding on all the parties. No party or its affiliates shall seek further
recourse to courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the
final decision of the Neutral Auditor as to the determination of the Final
Adjusted TBV. Fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate fees, expenses and costs of
the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by Green, and the other fifty percent (50%)
of such fees, expenses and costs shall be reflected in Transaction Expenses as
contemplated by Section 1.6(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the dispute
resolution process contemplated by Section 1.6(f) and (g) shall be only to
determine the disputed items reflected on the Final Closing Statement and
necessary to the calculation of the Final Adjusted TBV as of the applicable
month-end, regardless of the date on which the Neutral Auditor delivers its
calculation.

 



 

1.7 _Treatment of Patriot Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Patriot to purchase shares
of Patriot Common Stock under a Patriot Stock Plan, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Patriot Stock Option_ ") shall fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Patriot Common Stock subject to such Patriot Stock Option multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Per Patriot Share Cash Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Patriot Common Stock, less applicable tax
withholdings. Any Patriot Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of
Patriot Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Patriot Share
Cash Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Patriot Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
a Patriot Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Patriot Restricted Stock Award_ ", and together with the Patriot
Stock Options, the " _Patriot Equity Awards_ ") shall

 



      
 

 



 

fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Patriot Common
Stock underlying such Patriot Restricted Stock Award. Green or Patriot shall
be entitled to satisfy any withholding tax obligation by withholding a number
of shares or requiring the employee to pay such withholding taxes in cash, at
Greens or Patriots option.

 



 

(c) Green shall take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient
number of shares of Green Common Stock with respect to the settlement of
Patriot Restricted Stock Awards contemplated by this Section 1.7.

 



 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Patriot, the Board of Directors of
Patriot and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.7, and to ensure that following the Effective
Time, there are no obligations with respect to Patriot Equity Awards other
than as set forth in this Section 1.7.

 



 

1.8 _Certificate of Formation of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Certificate_ "), as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of formation of the surviving corporation in the Merger until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

1.9 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the surviving corporation in the
Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

1.10 _Directors and Officers_. At and immediately after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of the surviving corporation in the Merger shall
consist of the directors and officers of Merger Sub in office immediately
prior to the Effective Time until their respective successor are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

 



 

1.11 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (i) the parties
intend that (x) the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single
integrated transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (y) Green, Merger Sub and Patriot shall each
be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code, and (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code
and within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 



 

1.12 _Intermediate HoldCo and Bank Mergers_. Immediately following the
Integrated Mergers (i) Patriot Texas Holdings, Inc. (" _Patriot Intermediate
HoldCo_ "), a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Patriot, will
merge with and into Green, with Green being the surviving corporation (the "
_Intermediate HoldCo Merger_ ") and (ii) Patriot Bank (" _Patriot Bank_ "), a
Texas chartered state non-member bank and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Patriot, will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into Green Bank, N.A. a
national banking association and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Green (" _Green
Bank_ "). Green Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and,
following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate

 



      
 

 



 

existence of Patriot Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger
shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. On the date of
this Agreement, Green Bank and Patriot Bank entered into the agreement and
plan of merger attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_
"). Patriot and Patriot Intermediate HoldCo shall cause Patriot Bank and Green
shall cause Green Bank, to consummate the Bank Merger by filing such documents
and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank
Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the Effective Time.

 



 

1.13 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each outstanding share of Patriot Common Stock the holder of
which has perfected his appraisal rights under applicable law including the
terms and provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC (each a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ " and each such share, a " _Dissenting Share_ ")
shall be entitled to those rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of
Chapter 10 of the TBOC; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that a holder of
Patriot Common Stock fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such
right or remedy granted by the Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC, each
share of Patriot Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Patriot
shall give Green prompt notice upon receipt by Patriot of any demands for
payment of the value of such shares of Patriot Common Stock and of withdrawals
of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law,
and Green shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. Patriot shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Green, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by
such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights
under applicable law. Any payments made in respect of shares held by a
Dissenting Shareholder shall be made by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _EXCHANGE OF SHARES_**

 



 

2.1 _Green to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Green
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
designated by Green and reasonably acceptable to Patriot (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Greens option, evidence
of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to herein as "
_certificates_ "), representing the shares of Green Common Stock, and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Green
Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange
for outstanding shares of Patriot Common Stock.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 days thereafter, Green shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of Patriot
Common Stock immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive Green Common Stock pursuant to Article I, a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Green Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the shares of Patriot Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b), if any. Upon proper surrender of a
Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Green Common Stock to which such holder of
Patriot Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, and the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of
Certificates. Subject to applicable law in the case of shares held by
Dissenting Shareholders, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole
shares of Green Common Stock which the shares of Patriot Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Green Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Green
Common Stock which the shares of Patriot Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

 



 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Green Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Green Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Patriot of the shares of Patriot Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Green Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Green Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Green Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Green. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, after aggregating all
shares converted with respect to such former shareholder of Patriot, Green
shall pay to each former shareholder of Patriot who otherwise would be
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale
prices of Green Common Stock on the NASDAQ as reported in _The Wall Street
Journal_ for the ten (10) full trading days ending on the day preceding the
Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Green Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Patriot for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of Patriot who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of Green Common Stock,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Green Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former
share of Patriot Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Green, Patriot, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Patriot Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Each of Green and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Green Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including Patriot Equity Awards) to any person
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld (which may be
withheld through withholding of shares of Green Common Stock) by Green, Merger
Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect
of which the deduction and withholding was made by Green, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Green, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Green may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Green Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PATRIOT_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Patriot to Green
concurrently herewith (the " _Patriot Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ ,
that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Patriot Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Patriot that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III specifically referenced
or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article III to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies
to such other sections, Patriot hereby represents and warrants to Green as
follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Patriot is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Patriot. As used
in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect
to Green, Patriot or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material
adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results
of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i),
Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A)
changes, after the date hereof, in GAAP or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public

required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (E) the expenses incurred by Patriot or Green in
negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (F) any change in the value of the
securities or loan portfolio, or any change in the value of the deposits or
borrowings, of Green or Patriot, or any of their Subsidiaries, respectively,
resulting from a change in interest rates generally; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (F), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability
of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As
used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to
any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
bank or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person
of which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at
least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others

recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions

Material Adverse Effect on Patriot and (iii) has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of Patriot to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of

may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Patriot Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Patriot Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Patriot Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS,
the DOL, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in
a Patriot Benefit Plan or any other party.

 



 

(k) None of Patriot and its Subsidiaries nor any Patriot ERISA Affiliate nor
any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the

 



      
 

 



 

Patriot Benefit Plans or their related trusts, Patriot, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Patriot ERISA Affiliate or any person that Patriot or any of
its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(l) of the Patriot Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause
the vesting, exercisability or delivery of or increase in the amount or value
of, any payment, compensation (including stock or stock-based), right or other
benefit to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, consultant
or other service provider of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in

result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Neither Patriot nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a

vehicle.

 



 

(m) No Patriot Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Patriot has made

former employer or engager of any such individual relating (A) to the right of
any such individual to work for Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) to

hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2013, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Patriot, and to the knowledge of
Patriot no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Patriot and each of its

suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether or not set forth in the Patriot Disclosure Schedule, a
" _Patriot Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Patriot or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2013, by any Regulatory Agency or

entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with
applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are

the books and records of Patriot and such Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied. Each Derivative Contract is evidenced by customary and
appropriate documentation (including an ISDA master agreement and long-form
confirmation).

 



 

3.17 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Patriot,

under any Environmental Law, pending or threatened against Patriot, which
liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Patriot. To the
knowledge of Patriot, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or
obligation that would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Patriot. Patriot is not subject
to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of
agreement by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Green to
Patriot concurrently herewith (the " _Green Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not

 



      
 

 



 

result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Green Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by Patriot that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section
of Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article IV

such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
Green Reports filed by Green since August 7, 2014, and prior to the date
hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking

or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Green hereby
represents and warrants to Patriot as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Green is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Texas and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act. Green has the corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Green.
True and complete copies of (i) the Merger Sub Certificate and Merger Sub
Bylaws and (ii) the Restated Certificate of Formation (with Amendments) of
Green (the " _Green Certificate_ ") and the bylaws of Green as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Green to
Patriot.

 



 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Green (a " _Green Subsidiary_ ") is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Green, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are
no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Green to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Green that
is an insured depository institution are insured by the FDIC through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending

as of the date hereof has been filed as an exhibit to the most recent Annual

and neither Green nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice
of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Green.

 



 

(b) Each Green Contract is valid and binding on Green or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either

Material Adverse Effect on Green. Green and each of its Subsidiaries has in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it

counterparty to each Green Contract has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under such Green Contract,
except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Green,
and no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse
of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of Green or
any of its Subsidiaries under any such Green Contract, except where such
default, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Green.

 



 

4.13 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Except as set forth on _Section

_Green Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Green or any of its Subsidiaries been

4.14 _Related Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.14_ of
the Green Disclosure Schedule, there are no transactions or series of related
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are there any
currently proposed transactions or series of related transactions, between
Green or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former
director or "executive officer" (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Act) of Green or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who beneficially owns

generally.

 



 

4.15 _State Takeover Laws_. The Board of Directors of Green has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required to render
inapplicable to such agreements and transactions Subchapter M of Chapter 21 of
the TBOC and any other Takeover Statutes.

 



 

4.16 _Reorganization_. Green has not taken any action, and is not aware of any
fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Integrated Mergers, taken together, from being treated as an integrated
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 



 

4.17 _Opinion of Green s Financial Advisor_. Prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Green has received an opinion (which, if
initially rendered orally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion
dated the same date) of Jefferies LLC to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions,
qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid by Green pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Green.

 



 

4.18 _Internal Accounting Controls_. The records, systems, controls, data and
information of Green and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of Green or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership
and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Green. To the extent required by applicable law,
Green (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Green, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Green by others
within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Greens
outside auditors and the audit committee of Greens Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Greens ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Greens internal controls over financial
reporting.

 



 

4.19 _Regulatory Approvals_. As of the date hereof, Green is not aware of any
reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be
received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a
timely basis.

 



      
 

 



 

4.20 _SEC Reports_. Green has previously made available to Patriot an accurate
and complete copy of each communication mailed by Green to its stockholders
since August 7, 2014 and prior to the date hereof. No such communication or
any final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive
proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC since August 7, 2014 by

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were

respective dates, all Green Reports filed under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement,
no executive officer of Green has failed in any respect to make the

(d) Section 4.21(d) of the Green Disclosure Schedule identifies each Green
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the " _Green Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to each Green Qualified Plan and the related
trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened),
and, to the knowledge of Green, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
Green Qualified Plan or the exempt status of the related trust or increase the
costs relating thereto. No trust funding any Green Benefit Plan is intended to

ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms
are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

 



 

(h) Neither Green nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has
any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any
post-employment or retiree health or medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date

(j) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Greens knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may
reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Green
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Green Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Green
Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of Green or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the IRS, the DOL,
any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Green
Benefit Plan or any other party.

 



 

(k) None of Green and its Subsidiaries nor any Green ERISA Affiliate nor any
other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Green Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Green, any of its Subsidiaries, any Green ERISA Affiliate or any person that
Green or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

 



 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder approval
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause
the vesting, exercisability or delivery of or increase in the amount or value
of, any payment, compensation (including stock or stock-based), right or other
benefit to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor, consultant
or other service provider of Green or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in
any limitation on the right of Green or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Green Benefit Plan
or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
Green or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither Green nor any

under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. Green has made available

knowledge of Green, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other
group seeking to represent any employees of Green or any of its Subsidiaries

contractor of Green or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation in any material
respect of any term of any Restrictive Covenant or any employment or
consulting contract, common law nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, or
other obligation: (i) to Green or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to a former

such individual to work for Green or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) to the

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 



 

(a) Green and Patriot shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no later
than 45 business days after of the date of this Agreement, the Joint Proxy
Statement and Green shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and any
amendment thereto, if any. Each of Green and Patriot shall cooperate in
respect of the form and content of any other communication with the
shareholders of Patriot. Each of Green and Patriot shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Green and
Patriot shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their
respective shareholders. Green shall also use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Patriot shall furnish all information

 



      
 

 



 

concerning Patriot and the holders of Patriot Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (and in the case of the Bank
Regulatory Applications, as defined below, within 30 business days of the date
of this Agreement) prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger (collectively the " _Bank
Regulatory Applications_ ")), and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Entities. Green and Patriot shall have the right to review in
advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other on,
in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to Patriot or Green, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each
party shall consult with the other in advance of any formal meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Green or
Patriot to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would
reasonably be expected to restrict or burden Green, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Affiliates and which would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Green, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case measured on a scale
relative to Patriot (including, without limitation, any requirement to raise
or obtain capital in excess of the amount necessary to remain well capitalized
under generally applicable regulatory capital guidelines) (a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

 



 

(c) Green and Patriot shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Green,
Patriot or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Green and Patriot shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the "
_Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and
the Texas Department of Banking and (y) any other approvals set forth in
Sections 3.4 and 4.4 which are necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, or
those the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, for the purposes of
verifying the representations and warranties of Patriot and Green and
preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this Agreement,
each party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives
of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records (excluding
Greens tax returns and related workpapers), and shall cooperate with the
other party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents which either party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. Neither party nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of such partys customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) Each of Green and Patriot shall hold all information furnished by or on
behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter agreement,
dated April 8, 2015, between Green and Patriot (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties

 



      
 

 



 

of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_. Each of Green and Patriot shall call a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _Green Meeting_ " and the " _Patriot Meeting_ ,"
respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is
declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Patriot Vote and
the Requisite Green Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the
type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders
to adopt a merger agreement, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same
date. The Board of Directors of each of Green and Patriot shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of Green and Patriot,
as the case may be, the Requisite Green Vote, in the case of Green, and the
Requisite Patriot Vote, in the case of Patriot, including by communicating to
its respective shareholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve (i)
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the case of
Patriot, and (ii) the issuance of the shares of Green Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, in the case of Green. However, subject to Section
8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Patriot or Green, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to
recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to)
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors may not take
any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at least
three (3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise
to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action
is taken by the Board of Directors of Patriot in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by the other party and after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors,
determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. Green or Patriot shall
adjourn or postpone the Green Meeting or the Patriot Meeting, as the case may
be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of Green Common Stock or Patriot Common Stock, as the
case may

 



      
 

 



 

be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting Patriot or Green, as applicable, has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Patriot Vote
or the Requisite Green Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Green Meeting and Patriot Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement
shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of Green and Patriot at the
Green Meeting and the Patriot Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting
on the adoption of this Agreement and the issuance of the shares of Green
Common Stock in connection with the Merger, as applicable, and the other
matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either Green or Patriot of such obligation.

 



 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Green and Patriot shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Patriot or Green or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Green shall cause the shares of Green Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
twenty four (24) month anniversary thereof, Green shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the employees of Patriot and its Subsidiaries who
continue to be employed by Green or its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
while employed by Green and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, with
employee benefits (excluding equity and equity based-compensation) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Green and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that
Green may satisfy its obligation under Section 6.6(a) by providing such
Continuing Employees with employee benefits that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to the employee benefits provided by Patriot or its Subsidiaries
to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Green shall keep Patriots Chairman and CEO reasonably informed regarding
its personnel plans and decisions concerning Patriot employees developed prior
to the Effective Time, including which employees are or are not anticipated to
be Continuing Employees, and the identification of employees for eligibility
for Green Stock Options pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to Section 6(f). Greens CEO and Patriots Chairman and CEO shall mutually
agree upon the manner and form of any communications regarding such matters to
the affected Patriot employees, but for purposes of clarity, mutual agreement
shall not be required for Greens personnel plans and decisions concerning
Patriot employees. Other than to the affected Patriot employees and Patriots
Chairman and CEO, Green shall not disclose its personnel plans or decisions
concerning Patriot employees to any other Patriot employee without the prior
consent of Patriots Chairman and CEO, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Green or its Subsidiaries in
which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Green shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Patriot Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time under a Patriot Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Patriot Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with Patriot and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan
to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Patriot Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for
purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or benefit plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or
provides grandfathered benefits.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation agrees to honor in accordance with their terms
all benefits vested as of the Closing Date under the Patriot Benefit Plans.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant of Patriot or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Corporation, Patriot, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, Patriot, Green or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Patriot Benefit Plan, New
Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Patriot Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.10, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
including without limitation any current or former employee, officer,
director, independent contractor or consultant (or any

 



      
 

 



 

spouse or dependent of such individual) of Patriot or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, it is anticipated that Green will identify
certain Patriot employees that will be eligible for an award of Green Stock
Options, such award to be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of
customary and appropriate documentation including a non-competition, non-
disclosure, non-solicitation and non-interference agreement.

 



 

(g) Patriot shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Restated
Employment Agreement, dated December 4, 2014, entered into among Patriot Bank,
Patriot, and W. Don Ellis (the " _Patriot Employment Agreement_ ") shall be
terminated contingent upon and effective as of the Closing and all amounts
owed in connection therewith shall be paid on the Closing Date and properly
reflected on the books and records of Patriot and fully reflected in the Final
Adjusted TBV.

 



 

(h) Patriot shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Patriot Bank
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan adopted by Patriot Bank effective
November 1, 2014 (the " _SERP Plan_ ") shall be terminated contingent upon and
effective as of the Closing and all amounts owed to participants in connection
therewith shall be paid on the Closing Date and properly reflected on the
books and records of Patriot and fully reflected in the Final Adjusted TBV and
customary release agreements shall be obtained in connection therewith from
each such participant.

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Green and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director, officer or employee of Patriot and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Patriot Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Patriot or any
of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by Patriot pursuant to the Patriot Certificate, Patriot Bylaws,
the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Patriot; and
Green and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred by
such Patriot Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled
to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Patriot
pursuant to the Patriot Certificate, Patriots Bylaws, the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Patriot and any indemnification
agreements in existence as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that, if required,
the Patriot Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Patriot Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, in close consultation with Green, Patriot
shall purchase a directors and officers liability tail insurance policy with
respect to the Patriots existing basic and excess directors and officers
liability insurance or with respect to coverage and amount that are no less
favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the
Patriots existing policies as of the date hereof (the " _D andO Tail_"), in
either case, that, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
will provide directors and officers liability insurance that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Patriot (determined
as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and
officers arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Patriot Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

 



 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Green, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Patriot, on the other) or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Green.

 



 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Green and Patriot shall each promptly (but in no
event more than 24 hours) advise the other party of any change or event (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

6.10 _Corporate Governance_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Green shall
(i) appoint William Don Ellis to the Boards of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation as a Class I director and Green Bank, where he shall also hold the
title of Vice Chairman and (ii) appoint one other individual designated by
Patriot and reasonably acceptable to Green to the Board of Directors of Green
Bank.

 



      
 

 



 

6.11 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Patriot agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with
any person concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such person of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.11(a); _provided_ , that,
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of Patriot by the
Requisite Patriot Vote, in the event Patriot receives an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Patriot shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with Patriot. Patriot will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Green
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best
efforts, subject to applicable law, to (x) enforce any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (y)
within ten (10) business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the
return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person
(other than Green and its affiliates) pursuant to any such agreement. Patriot
will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Green following receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and copies of any
written Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Green apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of Patriot and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of Patriot or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of Patriot, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Patriot or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Patriot, or
(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving

 



      
 

 



 

Patriot or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Patriot.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Patriot or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules

the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the
method or structure of effecting the combination of Patriot and Green

transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in

to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may

if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

Governmental Entities and the prior written approval of Green, Patriot may
incur indebtedness for the purpose of completing the Patriot Preferred Stock
Redemption at any time prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any indebtedness incurred by Patriot would be repaid in full prior to the
Closing. In addition, Patriot shall take all actions necessary to effect,

Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms
thereof and the documents and agreements related thereto (the " _Patriot

6.18 _Leases_. Patriot shall use commercially reasonable efforts to modify
each lease set forth in _Section 6.18(a)_ of the Patriot Disclosure Schedule
to provide for a termination date of ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date and obtain the consent of the landlord to the assumption of such lease by
Green. Patriot shall use commercially reasonable efforts to modify each of the
leases described in _Section 6.18(b)_ of the Patriot Disclosure Schedule to
provide for a termination date of not less than one (1) and no longer than (3)
years from the original termination date contained in such lease and obtain
the consent of the landlord to the assumption of such lease by Green.

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT_**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of Green or Patriot:

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of Green and Patriot in a written instrument, if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 



 

(b) by either the Board of Directors of Green or the Board of Directors of
Patriot if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory
Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either the Board of Directors of Green or the Board of Directors of
Patriot if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the one (1)
year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; _provided_ that
if the condition set forth in Section 7.1(c) shall not have been satisfied as
of such date, Green may, by written notice provided to Patriot, extend the

Patriot ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement
on the part of Patriot, in the case of a termination by Green, or Green, in
the case of a termination by Patriot, which breach or failure to be true,
either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party
(or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Green, or
7.3, in the case of a termination by Patriot, and which is not cured within 45
days following written notice to Patriot, in the case of a termination by
Green, or Green, in the case of a termination by Patriot, or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior
to the Termination Date);

 



   

     
 

 



 

(e) by Patriot, if the Board of Directors of Green shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Green approve
the issuance of shares of Green Common Stock in connection with the Merger, or
withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to
Patriot, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation
within two (2) business days after Patriot requests in writing that such
action be taken, or (ii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 in any
material respect;

 



 

(f) by Green, if the Board of Directors of Patriot shall have (i) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Patriot adopt
this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Green, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such
recommendation within two (2) business days after Green requests in writing
that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a
tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Patriot Common Stock that has
been publicly disclosed (other than by Green or an affiliate of Green) within
ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange
offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof, (ii)
recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) breached its
obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.11 in any material respect;

 



 

(g) By Green if, Patriot shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Patriot
Vote at the duly convened Patriot Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken; or

 



 

(h) By Patriot if, Green shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Green Vote
at the duly convened Green Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was taken.

 



 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Green or Patriot
as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect, and none of Green, Patriot, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and this
Section 8.2 and Article IX (other than Section 9.1) shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Green nor Patriot shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management or Board of Directors of Patriot or has
been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Patriot and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Green or
Patriot pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and Patriot shall have failed to obtain the
Requisite Patriot Vote at the duly convened Patriot Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Green pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12)

 



      
 

 



 

months after the date of such termination, Patriot enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then
Patriot shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Green, by wire
transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $5,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
"); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Green pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then Patriot shall pay Green, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Patriot pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Green shall pay Patriot, by wire transfer of same day
funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Green pursuant to
Section 8.1(g), then Patriot shall pay Green, by wire transfer of same day
funds, an amount equal to the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Green in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the execution, negotiation and diligence thereof, on the date of
termination.

 



 

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Patriot pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), then Green shall pay Patriot, by wire transfer of same day
funds, an amount equal to the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Patriot in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the execution, negotiation and diligence thereof, on the date of
termination.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, the
maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable by a
single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee.

 



 

(h) Each of Green and Patriot acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Green or Patriot fails promptly to pay
the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against
the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or the amounts contemplated by
Section 8.2(e) or Section 8.2(f), as applicable, such non-paying party shall
pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Green or Patriot, as
the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per
annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any
successor thereto) in

 



      
 

 



 

effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid.

 



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of Green and
Patriot; _provided_ , _however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the
respective shareholders of Green or Patriot, there may not be, without further
approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires
further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

 



 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after adoption of this Agreement by the respective
shareholders of Green or Patriot, there may not be, without further approval
of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion
thereof that requires further approval under applicable law. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
