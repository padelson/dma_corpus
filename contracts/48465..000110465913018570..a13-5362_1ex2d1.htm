NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

unconditionally guarantees the timely payment and performance of all
obligations of Purchaser and PRC Purchaser hereunder.

SECTION 1.03. _Consents to Certain Assignments._ (a) Prior to the Global

relating to the China Acquisition), as applicable, Seller will provide or
cause to be provided all commercially reasonable assistance to Purchaser (not
including the payment of any consideration or concession of any right)
reasonably requested by Purchaser to secure any consent or authorization that
is required from any third party in connection with the applicable
transactions contemplated hereby, including those listed in Section 3.03 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or
assign, directly or indirectly, any asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising under or resulting from such asset if an attempted direct or indirect
assignment thereof, without the consent, approval or authorization ("
_Consent_ ") of a third party (including a Governmental Entity), would
constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention of the rights
of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an
agreement concerning such asset, claim or right, would violate any Applicable
Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates or, upon transfer, Purchaser under such asset, claim or
right. If any direct or indirect transfer or assignment by Seller or any of
the Seller Affiliates to Purchaser, or any direct or indirect acquisition or
assumption by Purchaser of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or
commitment under, any asset, claim or right requires the Consent of a third
party as set forth above, then such transfer or assignment or assumption shall
be made subject to such Consent being obtained. Purchaser agrees that neither
Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to
Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such Consent
that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or because of any circumstances resulting therefrom. Purchaser
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller herein
shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such Consent, (ii) any
circumstances resulting therefrom or (iii) any suit, action or proceeding (a "
_Proceeding_ ") or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of
any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
Consent or any circumstances resulting therefrom.

 



 

(b) If any such Consent is not obtained prior to the Global Closing (with
respect to the Global Transferred Assets) or the China Closing (with respect
to the China Transferred Assets), the Global Closing or the China Closing, as
applicable, shall nonetheless take place on the terms set forth herein and,
thereafter, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure such
Consent as promptly as practicable after the Global Closing or the China
Closing, as applicable, and Seller shall provide or cause to be provided all
commercially reasonable assistance to Purchaser (not including the payment of
any consideration or concession of any right) reasonably requested by
Purchaser to secure such Consent after the Global Closing or the China
Closing, as applicable, or cooperate with Purchaser (at PurchaserÂ’s expense)
in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by
Purchaser under which (i) Purchaser shall obtain (without infringing upon the
legal rights of such third party or violating any Applicable Law) the economic
claims, rights and benefits (net of the amount of any related Tax costs
imposed on Seller, any of the Seller Affiliates or any of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

affiliates) under the asset, claim or right with respect to which the Consent
has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser
shall assume any related economic burden (including the amount of any related
Tax costs imposed on Seller, any of the Seller Affiliates or any of their
respective affiliates) with respect to the asset, claim or right with respect
to which the Consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Assumption of Liabilities._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser or PRC Purchaser shall assume,
effective as of the Global Closing (in the case of the Global Assumed
Liabilities) and the China Closing (in the case of the China Assumed
Liabilities), and shall pay, perform and discharge when due, the following
obligations, liabilities and commitments of any nature, whether known or
unknown, express or implied, primary or secondary, direct or indirect,
liquidated, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due, arising out of, relating to or otherwise in respect of the
Transferred Assets, the Business or the operation or conduct of the Business
(collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "):

 



 

(i) all obligations, liabilities and commitments under the Transferred
Contracts and the Transferred Permits to the extent such obligations,
liabilities and commitments relate to the period from and after the Global
Closing Date or the China Closing Date, as applicable (other than any such
obligations, liabilities and commitments to the extent resulting from any
breach by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates of its obligations under such
Transferred Contracts or from any violation by Seller or any of the Seller
Affiliates of such Transferred Permits prior to the Global Closing Date or the
China Closing Date, as applicable);

 



 

(ii) all obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect of any and all
products manufactured or sold by the Business at any time, including

liabilities or commitments (" _Product Claims_ "), other than Product Claims
that result from (x) any and all products sold by the Business prior to the
Global Closing or the China Closing, as applicable, and (y) the failure of any
products manufactured prior to the Global Closing or the China Closing, as
applicable, to meet the specifications for such products on the Global Closing
Date or the China Closing Date, as applicable (the " _Retained Product Claims_
");

 



 

(iii) all Assumed Environmental Liabilities;

 



 

(iv) other than the items included in Section 1.04(a)(vi), which are assumed

claims, arising out of, relating to or otherwise in any way in respect of the
Business or the operation or conduct of the Business on or after the Global
Closing Date or the China Closing Date, as applicable;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) all obligations, liabilities and commitments (including any defense costs,
third-party legal fees and similar expenses) in respect of the matters set
forth in Section 3.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, whether commenced
prior to or after the Global Closing or the China Closing, as applicable;

VI hereof;

therein (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), such Statement shall become final and
binding. During such 15-day period Purchaser and its representatives shall be

Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the
objections set forth therein and shall include a special purpose report of

the matters set forth in such Notice of Objection and that such Notice of
Objection has been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.03. Any Notice
of Objection shall

 



      
 

 



 

include only objections based on (A) mathematical errors in the computation of

(ii) If Purchaser provides the applicable Notice of Objection to Seller within
such 15-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30-day period
following SellerÂ’s receipt of such Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith
to resolve PurchaserÂ’s objections. During such 30-day period, Seller and its

the working papers of Purchaser and PurchaserÂ’s Accountants relating to such
Notice of Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and Seller are unable

nationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser

within 10 days after the end of such 30-day period, then Purchaser and Seller
shall each select such a firm and such firms shall jointly select a third
nationally recognized firm to resolve the disputed matters (such selected firm
being the " _Independent Expert_ ")). The parties shall instruct the
Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision as promptly as
practicable but in no event later than 60 days after its selection. The
resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a
judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. The fees
and disbursements of PurchaserÂ’s independent auditors incurred in connection
with their review of the applicable Statement and certification of any Notice
of Objection shall be borne by Purchaser. After the applicable Statement shall
have become final and binding, neither party shall have any further right to
make any claims against the other in respect of (i) any element of the Global

Purchaser raised, or could have raised, in the applicable Notice of Objection
or (ii) any payment made pursuant to Section 2.03(c).

entire amount, if any, by which the Global Closing Inventory exceeds
$35,000,000 (the " _Global Target Inventory_ "), if the Global Closing
Inventory exceeds $35,100,000, and the Global Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the entire amount, if any, by which the Global Closing Inventory
is less than the Global Target Inventory, if the Global Closing Inventory is
less than $34,900,000 (the Global Purchase Price as so increased or decreased
being hereinafter called the " _Adjusted Global Purchase Price_ "). The China

 



      
 

 



 

Purchase Price shall be increased by the entire amount, if any, by which the
China Closing Inventory exceeds 20,564,280 Renminbi (the " _China Target
Inventory_ "), if the China Closing Inventory exceeds 21,187,440 Renminbi, and
the China Purchase Price shall be decreased by the entire amount, if any, by
which China Closing Inventory is less than the China Target Inventory, if the
China Closing Inventory is less than 19,941,120 Renminbi (the China Purchase
Price as so increased or decreased being hereinafter called the " _Adjusted
China Purchase Price_ "). Within 10 days after the applicable Statement has
become final and binding in accordance with Section 2.03(b), (i) if the Global
Closing Date Payment or the China Closing Date Payment, as applicable, is less
than the Adjusted Global Purchase Price or the Adjusted China Purchase Price,
as applicable, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such
difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum from the
applicable Closing Date to the date payment is made in full, and (ii) if the
Global Closing Date Payment or the China Closing Date Payment, as applicable,
is greater than the Adjusted Global Purchase Price or the Adjusted China
Purchase Price, as applicable, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to such difference, plus simple interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum
from the applicable Closing Date to the date payment is made in full (the
Global Closing Date Payment and the China Closing Date Payment as so increased
or decreased being hereinafter called the " _Global Final Purchase Price_ "
and the " _China Final Purchase Price_ ", respectively, and, collectively, the
" _Final Purchase Price_ "); _provided_ that any such adjustment to the China
Closing Date Payment shall be effected by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable,
causing PRC Purchaser (or an affiliate thereof specified by Purchaser) or PRC
Seller (or an affiliate thereof specified by Seller), as applicable, to make
such payment to the other. Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) _Post-Closing Books and Records._ Following the applicable Closing through
the resolution of any adjustment to the Global Purchase Price or the China
Purchase Price, as applicable, contemplated by this Section 2.03, Purchaser
shall not take any action with respect to the accounting books and records of
the Business on which the applicable Statement is to be based that could
prevent, obstruct or otherwise affect (i) the results of the procedures set
forth in this Section 2.03, including the value of the Global Closing
Inventory or the China Closing Inventory, as applicable, or any other value
set forth on such Statement, or (ii) the procedures set forth in this Section
2.03, including the preparation of the Statement or the resolution of any
dispute regarding the Statement. During the period of time from and after the
applicable Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the Global
Purchase Price or the China Purchase Price, as applicable, contemplated by
this Section 2.03, Purchaser shall afford to Seller and any accountants,
counsel or financial advisers retained by Seller in connection with any
adjustment to the Global Purchase Price or the China Purchase Price, as
applicable, contemplated by this Section 2.03 reasonable access during normal
business hours to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records
of the Business relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.03.

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Further Assurances._

 



      
 

 



 

(a) At the applicable Closing and from time to time after such Closing and
without further consideration, each party shall execute and deliver any
further documents, certificates and other instruments (including the execution
of local forms or notarization and/or legalization required for the recording
of any assignments of applicable Transferred Intellectual Property or
Additional Trademarks outside of the United States) and take such other action
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, as may reasonably be requested by
the other, for the purpose of effectuating the intent of this Agreement.
Should either Closing occur and Purchaser thereafter claim that one or more
assets that should have constituted Global Transferred Assets or China
Transferred Assets, as the case may be, were not transferred to Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, PurchaserÂ’s remedies shall not be
limited to money damages and Purchaser shall be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) In addition, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection
with actions contemplated by Section 5.09, the parties shall execute the China
Land Transfer Agreement and the China Property Transfer Agreement prior to the
China Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder shall not take
effect prior to, and shall be conditioned upon consummation of, the China
Closing. For purposes of the China Land Transfer Agreement and the China
Property Transfer Agreement, the Closing Date (as such term is used therein)
shall be the China Closing Date. Purchaser hereby agrees that the China Land
Transfer Agreement and the China Property Transfer Agreement (i) shall not be
used to register, attempt to register or otherwise attempt to make effective
prior to the China Closing the conveyances provided for therein and (ii) shall
only be used in connection with the actions contemplated by Section 5.09.

Intellectual Property. In connection with the Registered Business Intellectual
Property, all registrations are in force and all applications for the same are

or threatened by or before the Governmental Entity in which the registrations
or applications are issued or filed. The Registered Business Intellectual
Property is valid and enforceable and none of the Registered Business
Intellectual Property has been declared invalid or unenforceable or been
limited by any court or arbitration panel. No material claims are pending or,
to the knowledge of Seller, threatened as of the date of this Agreement
against Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates by any person claiming that the
use of the Transferred Intellectual Property in the operation or conduct of
the Business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual
Property rights of any such person. During the three year period immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of the Seller
Affiliates has received any written notice alleging that the operation or
conduct of the Business infringes the Intellectual Property rights of any
person. The operation of the Business as currently conducted does not and, to
the knowledge of Seller, the operation of the Business as planned to be
conducted will not, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property rights of any person.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.07(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates has granted any license of any
kind relating to any Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred
Technology, except non-exclusive licenses to end-users in the ordinary course
of business. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates is bound by or a
party to any option, license or similar Contract relating to any Intellectual
Property of any other person for the use of such Intellectual Property in the
conduct of the Business, except where payments under the applicable Contract
are less than $50,000 per year and the Contract is (i) for non-exclusive

Affiliate regarding infringement, misappropriation or other violation by any
person of SellerÂ’s or any Seller AffiliateÂ’s rights to, or in connection with,
the Transferred Intellectual Property or Transferred Technology.

 



 

(f) All trade secrets of Seller and the Seller Affiliates that are included
in the Transferred Technology have been maintained by Seller and the Seller
Affiliates subject to secrecy safeguards in a manner substantially consistent

secrets generally. No formulas, recipes or manufacturing processes that are
owned by Seller or any Seller Affiliate that are material to the Business have
been disclosed to any third person other than pursuant to a written agreement

China Business, except (i) as required by law, regulation or legal process, in
which case Seller will provide Purchaser reasonable notice and Seller will,
and will cause all Seller Affiliates, to cooperate with PurchaserÂ’s reasonable
efforts to contest and oppose such disclosure, and such disclosed information
shall remain confidential for all other purposes and (ii) for information that
is (or after the China Closing Date, becomes, other than as a result of a
breach of this Section 5.03(b)) generally known to the public or within the
industry in which Seller and the Seller Affiliates operate.

 



 

SECTION 5.04. _Best Efforts._ (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
cause the Global Closing and the China Closing to occur, including taking all
actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on it or any of its affiliates with respect to thereto. Each of Seller
and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
affiliates to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be
expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not
being satisfied.

 



 

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than five (5) business days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such other filings
as are necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with all Applicable
Laws relating to competition and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested by applicable Governmental Entities relating thereto.
Any such filing, notification and report form and supplemental information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
such other Applicable Law. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or

 



      
 

 



 

submission that is necessary under the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law.
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable Governmental
Entity and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request and shall
promptly provide any supplemental information requested in connection with the
filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law.
Any such supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or such other Applicable Law. Each party shall use
its best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act or such
other Applicable Law for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party hereby agrees to request the early termination

for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the Acquisition
or any portion thereof and (ii) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and

offering to take or committing to take any action which Purchaser is capable
of taking and, if the offer is accepted, taking or committing to take such
action that limits PurchaserÂ’s freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Purchaser or
any of its subsidiaries or any assets of the Businesses, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Global Closing or the China Closing
beyond the Outside Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall take any
and all actions necessary to ensure that (x) no requirement of or waiver,
consent or approval of the FTC, the DOJ, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity, (y) no Judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order
or any other order in any Proceeding and (z) no other matter relating to any
antitrust or competition law or regulation, would preclude consummation of the
Acquisition by the Outside Date.

 



 

SECTION 5.05. _Non Competition_. (a) Except as expressly provided herein, for
a period of three years from and after the Global Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the business of
manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling peanut butter spread
products (the " _Competing Activities_ ") anywhere in the world; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Seller and its affiliates may own or acquire, directly or
indirectly, (i) the securities of any person that engages in any of the
Competing Activities if Seller and its affiliates do not, directly or
indirectly, own more than 20% of the aggregate outstanding equity securities
of such person and (ii) any person that engages in any of the Competing
Activities if such Competing Activities account for less than 20% of the
consolidated annual revenues or assets of such person and remains such for the
Restricted Period.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.05(a) to the contrary, none of
Seller and any of its affiliates shall be prevented from (i) continuing to
engage in, to

 



      
 

 



 

conduct or to have an ownership interest in any business which it currently is
engaging in or conducting or in which it currently has an ownership interest
(including (A) any such business that manufactures, markets, distribute or
sells peanut butter spread products and (B) from the Global Closing Date to
the China Closing Date, the China Business), including (x) any reasonable
extension or development of such business and (y) any geographical expansion
of such business (or any reasonable extension or development thereof), (ii)
engaging in, or conducting or having an ownership interest in any business
that supplies goods or services primarily to Seller or its affiliates and
(iii) treating the provisions of Section 5.05(a) as having terminated at the
time and to the extent none of Purchaser and its subsidiaries continues to
conduct in any material respect any aspect of the Business. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the Restricted Period, clause (i) of this Section
5.05(b) shall not be deemed to permit the marketing, distribution or sale of
peanut butter spread products by Seller or any Seller Affiliate in the
countries and territories set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereby
acknowledge (A) that de minimis quantities of peanut butter spread products
sold by Seller outside of the countries and territories set forth in Section
5.05(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule may be resold, marketed or
distributed by third parties within any such country or territory and (B) that
Seller shall not have any liability to Purchaser whatsoever in connection with
or as a result of any such third party actions.

as to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or person is or will be entitled to any brokerÂ’s or finderÂ’s fee or
any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except, as to Seller and its affiliates,
Lazard Freres and Co. LLC, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller and,
as to Purchaser and its affiliates, Barclays, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Purchaser.

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _No Shop._ Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof
and ends upon the earlier of the China Closing and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, Seller will not, and Seller will not
authorize any affiliate, representative or agent of Seller to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek or encourage any inquiry, proposal or
offer from, furnish any information to or participate in any discussion or
negotiation with any Person (other than Purchaser or any person on PurchaserÂ’s
behalf) regarding any acquisition of the Brand or the Transferred Assets, in
whole or in part (by asset purchase, merger, tender offer, statutory share
exchange, joint venture or otherwise), except sales of Inventory in the
ordinary course of business of Seller. Seller will, and Seller will cause each
affiliate, representative or agent of Seller to, immediately terminate all
such discussions or negotiations that may be in progress on the date hereof.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Shandong Peanut._ Upon the China Closing, Seller hereby agrees
to cause PRC Seller to use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
deregistration and dissolution of Bestfoods (Shandong) Co., Ltd. as soon as

SECTION 5.09. _Certain PRC Purchaser Matters._ Without limiting Section 5.04,
Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, take such
actions as are necessary under Applicable Law for Purchaser, through PRC
Purchaser or any other affiliate of Purchaser, to be able to conduct the China
Business at the China Facility in all material respects as such China Business
is being conducted by PRC Seller at the China Facility immediately prior to
the China Closing. Such actions may include causing PRC Purchaser to (a)
change its business scope, total investment, registered capital, articles of
association, name and related organizational items; (b) as promptly as
practicable after such changes are completed, make application to establish
the Branch; and (c) cause the Branch, once established, to promptly apply for
and procure all licenses, permits, approvals, certifications and
qualifications as are necessary under Applicable Law.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

 



 

 _Employment Matters_

 



 

SECTION 6.01. _Business Employees_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Business Employee_ " shall refer to each employee of Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates who is employed primarily in connection with the Business
and who is (a) employed at the Little Rock Facility (each individual described
in this clause (a), a " _U.S. Business Employee_ ") or (b) employed at the
China Facility (each individual described in this clause (b) a " _China
Business Employee_ "); _provided_ that the employees set forth in Section 6.01
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be Business Employees. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _China Dispatched Employees_ " shall
mean the workers dispatched by Weifang Municipal Weicheng District LiMin
Labour Security Agency Co., Ltd. (the " _Agency_ ") under a labor dispatch
service agreement entered into by and between PRC Seller and the Agency (the "
_Service Agreement_ "). Unless otherwise indicated, Sections 6.02 through
Section 6.12 shall apply only to U.S. Business Employees, Section 6.13 shall
apply only to China Business Employees and China Dispatched Employees and
Sections 6.14 through 6.16 shall apply to all Business Employees and China
Dispatched Employees.

 



 

SECTION 6.02. _Continuation of Employment._ No later than 10 days prior to the
Global Closing Date, Purchaser or one of its affiliates shall offer employment
(which shall include PurchaserÂ’s compliance with PurchaserÂ’s covenants set
forth in this Article VI), effective as of 12:01 a.m. local time on the Global
Closing Date (the " _Transfer Time_ "), to all U.S. Business Employees who on
the Global Closing Date are actively at work (each, an " _Active Employee_ ").
For purposes of this Agreement, any U.S. Business Employee who is not actively
at work on the Global Closing Date due to a short-term absence (including due
to vacation, holiday, illness or injury of shorter duration than a long-term
disability, jury duty or bereavement leave) in accordance with applicable
policies of Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate shall be deemed an
Active Employee. With respect to each U.S. Business Employee who is not an
Active Employee (an " _Inactive Employee_ "), no later than 12 days prior to
the Global Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule of the
U.S. Business Employees that Seller expects to be Inactive Employees as of the
Global Closing Date and Seller shall update

 



      
 

 



 

that schedule, if necessary, to reflect any changes to the list of Inactive
Employees between the date the schedule is provided and the Global Closing
Date as soon as practicable following the Global Closing Date, but in any
event no later than 30 days following the Global Closing Date, and Purchaser
or one of its affiliates shall make offers of employment (which shall include
PurchaserÂ’s compliance with PurchaserÂ’s covenants set forth in this Article
VI) to each Inactive Employee effective as of the date on which such Inactive
Employee presents himself or herself to Purchaser or one of its affiliates for
active employment following the Global Closing Date to the same extent, if
any, as Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate would be required to
reemploy such Inactive Employee in accordance with its policies as in effect
on the Global Closing Date and Applicable Law, as reasonably determined by
Purchaser or one of its affiliates, provided that such return occurs within
one year following the Global Closing Date. Each U.S. Business Employee who
accepts PurchaserÂ’s or one of its affiliateÂ’s offer of employment and who
satisfactorily completes all reasonable and necessary documents in order to
commence employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates as of the Transfer
Time is referred to herein as a " _U.S. Transferred Employee_ ". Effective as
of the Transfer Time, each U.S. Transferred Employee shall cease to be an
employee of Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates and shall cease to
participate in any Seller Benefit Plan, except to the extent provided under
the applicable Seller Benefit Plan. In the case of any Inactive Employee who
becomes a U.S. Transferred Employee within one year following the Global
Closing Date, all references in this Agreement to the Transfer Time shall be
deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m. local time on the date that such
individual becomes a U.S. Transferred Employee.

 



 

SECTION 6.03. _Credited Service._ From and after the Transfer Time, Purchaser
or one of its affiliates shall give each U.S. Transferred Employee full credit
for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, early
retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit
accrual but not for benefit accrual purposes for salaried employees under
PurchaserÂ’s defined benefit pension retirement plans) under any employee
benefit plans or arrangements, maintained by Purchaser and its affiliates, for
the U.S. Transferred EmployeesÂ’ service with Seller, the Seller Affiliates and
any of their respective predecessor employers to the same extent recognized by
Seller and the Seller Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.04. _Continuation of Benefits_. (a) For the two-year period
immediately following the Global Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its affiliates to, provide each U.S. Transferred Employee with (i) salary and
cash bonus opportunities that in each case are no less favorable to such U.S.
Transferred Employee than those in effect immediately prior to the Global
Closing Date and (ii) employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than
salary and cash bonus opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such U.S. Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Global Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Transition Bonus._ Within 30 days following each of the first and second
anniversaries of the Transfer Time, Purchaser or one of its affiliates shall
pay each U.S. Transferred Employee employed with the Purchaser or one of its
affiliates as of each such anniversary date a lump-sum cash payment equal to
the applicable amounts set

 



       
 

 



 

forth in Section 6.04(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, subject to any
withholdings required by Applicable Law (each such payment, a " _Transition
Bonus_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, each Transition Bonus shall be
considered, to the extent provided, an "employee benefit plan or arrangement"
provided to each U.S. Transferred Employee by Purchaser or one of its
affiliates for purposes of satisfying PurchaserÂ’s obligations as set forth in
Section 6.04(a)(ii).

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Severance_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser agrees to provide each U.S. Transferred Employee whose
employment is terminated by Purchaser or its affiliates during the two-year
period immediately following the Global Closing Date with severance benefits
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the greater of (i) the
severance benefits provided by the Seller severance plan applicable to such
U.S. Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Global Closing Date and
(ii) the severance benefits such U.S. Transferred Employee would be entitled
to receive under the plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangements of
Purchaser or its affiliates applicable to similarly situated employees
immediately prior to such termination, taking into account such U.S.
Transferred EmployeeÂ’s length of service with Seller or the applicable Seller
Affiliate as provided in Section 6.03. Seller and Purchaser intend that the
Active Employees who become U.S. Transferred Employees will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Global Closing. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and the Seller Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers, and employees from, all Losses that may result
in respect of claims made by any U.S. Business Employees for severance or
other separation benefits (including claims for wrongful dismissal, notice of
termination of employment or pay in lieu of notice) arising out of, relating
to or in connection with (a) PurchaserÂ’s failure to offer employment to any
U.S. Business Employee in accordance with this Agreement, (b) PurchaserÂ’s
failure to offer employment to any U.S. Business Employee on terms sufficient
to avoid severance or separation benefits under Applicable Law or the
applicable severance benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement
of Seller and the Seller Affiliates in effect immediately prior to the Global
Closing Date or (c) PurchaserÂ’s termination of employment of any U.S.
Transferred Employee on or following the Transfer Time; _provided_ that
Purchaser shall not indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Seller
Affiliates for any Losses arising out of SellerÂ’s and the Seller AffiliatesÂ’
failure to comply with any of their material obligations under Applicable Law
prior to the Transfer Time with respect to the termination of any U.S.
Business Employee.

 



 

SECTION 6.06. _Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan_. (a) No later than the
Global Closing Date, Purchaser shall have in effect one or more defined
contribution plans that each include a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, " _Purchaser
Â’s 401(k) Plan_") that will provide benefits, for the two-year period
immediately following the Global Closing Date consistent with Section
6.04(a)(ii). Each U.S. Transferred Employee participating in the UNICare
Savings Plan (" _Seller Â’s 401(k) Plan_") as of the Transfer Time shall become
a participant in PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan as of the Transfer Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser agrees to cause PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan to allow each U.S.
Transferred Employee to make a "direct rollover" to PurchaserÂ’s 401(k) Plan of
the account balances of such U.S. Transferred Employee (including promissory
notes evidencing any outstanding loans) under SellerÂ’s 401(k) Plan if such
direct rollover is elected in accordance with Applicable Law by such U.S.
Transferred Employee. Following a "direct rollover" of a U.S. Transferred
EmployeeÂ’s account balances, Seller shall have no liability or obligation for
any costs, expenses or damages that may result from any claim for any benefit
alleged to be payable under SellerÂ’s 401(k) Plan with respect to such U.S.
Transferred Employee and such U.S. Transferred EmployeeÂ’s beneficiaries, other
than any costs, expenses or damages that may result from any claim for any
benefit alleged to be payable under SellerÂ’s 401(k) Plan arising out of the
failure by Seller to administer SellerÂ’s 401(k) Plan in compliance with
Applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.07. _Tax-Qualified Pension Plan._ Seller shall retain all assets and
liabilities under the UNICare Retirement Plan (" _Seller Â’s Pension Plan_") in
respect of benefits accrued thereunder by U.S. Transferred Employees prior to
such employeeÂ’s Transfer Time and shall make payments to such U.S. Transferred
Employees with vested rights thereunder in accordance with the terms of
SellerÂ’s Pension Plan and Applicable Law. No U.S. Transferred Employee shall
accrue any benefit under such plan in respect of service with Purchaser or any
of its affiliates after such employeeÂ’s Transfer Time. No assets or
liabilities of SellerÂ’s Pension Plan shall be transferred to any retirement
plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 6.08. _Certain Welfare Benefits Matters._ (a) No later than the
Global Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or cause to be established, at
its own expense, benefit plans that provide life insurance, health care,
dental care, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability and
other group welfare benefits for U.S. Transferred Employees (" _Purchaser
Welfare Plans_ "). Purchaser shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the participating U.S. Transferred
Employees and their dependents under the Purchaser Welfare Plans to the extent
waived under the applicable corresponding Seller Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Transfer Time and (ii) provide each participating U.S.
Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Transfer Time in the calendar
year in which the Transfer Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Purchaser
Welfare Plans in which such U.S. Transferred Employee participates after the
Transfer Time.

 



 

(b) Seller and the applicable Seller Affiliates shall be responsible in
accordance with their respective welfare plans in effect prior to the Transfer
Time for all reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims) for
expenses incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims (such as life
insurance claims) incurred, under such plans prior to the Transfer Time by
U.S. Transferred Employees and their dependents. Purchaser shall be
responsible in accordance with the applicable Purchaser Welfare Plans for all
reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims) for expenses
incurred, and for all non-reimbursement claims (such as life insurance claims)
incurred, on or after

 



      
 

 



 

the Transfer Time by U.S. Transferred Employees and their dependents. For
purposes of this Section 6.08(b), a claim shall be deemed to have been
incurred on (i) the date of death or dismemberment in the case of claims under
life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment policies or (ii) the
date on which the charge or expense giving rise to such claim is incurred in
the case of all other claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a
hospital stay that commences prior to the Transfer Time and ends at or after
the Transfer Time, the cost thereof shall be apportioned between Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, with Seller responsible for that
portion of the cost incurred prior to the Transfer Time and Purchaser
responsible for the balance of such cost. Effective as of the Transfer Time,
Purchaser shall assume all liabilities and obligations of Seller and the
Seller Affiliates incurred on or after the Transfer Time to U.S. Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents, in respect of health insurance under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("
_COBRA_ "), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("
_HIPAA_ ") and applicable state law; _provided_ that Seller and the Seller
Affiliates shall remain obligated to provide any applicable COBRA coverage
notices in respect of events occurring prior to the Transfer Time.

 



 

(c) Seller shall be responsible for all claims for workersÂ’ compensation
benefits which are incurred prior to the Transfer Time by U.S. Transferred
Employees that are payable under the terms and conditions of SellerÂ’s or the
applicable Seller AffiliateÂ’s workersÂ’ compensation programs. PurchaserÂ’s or
its applicable affiliateÂ’s workersÂ’ compensation program(s) shall be
responsible for all claims for benefits that are incurred from and after the
Transfer Time by U.S. Transferred Employees that are payable under the terms
and conditions of PurchaserÂ’s or its applicable affiliateÂ’s workersÂ’
compensation program(s), including with respect to U.S. Transferred Employees
who became eligible for workersÂ’ compensation benefits prior to the Transfer
Time. For purposes of this Section 6.08(c), a claim for workersÂ’ compensation
benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the
claim occurs (the " _Workers Â’ Compensation Event_"). If the WorkersÂ’
Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following the
Transfer Time, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability of
Seller and Purchaser and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based upon the relative periods of
time that the WorkersÂ’ Compensation Event transpired preceding and following
the Transfer Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.09. _Cafeteria Plan._ Purchaser shall have in effect as of the
Global Closing Date flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria
plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Purchaser Â’s Cafeteria
Plan_") that provide benefits to U.S. Transferred Employees that are
consistent (in accordance with Section 6.04(a)(ii)) with those provided
pursuant to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the UNI _Care_
Benefits of Choice Program (the " _Seller Â’s Cafeteria Plan_") and Purchaser
agrees to cause PurchaserÂ’s Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-off of the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts from SellerÂ’s Cafeteria Plan and to
honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which the Transfer
Time occurs the elections made by each U.S. Transferred Employee under the
SellerÂ’s Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Transfer Time. As soon as practicable following the Transfer Time, Seller
shall cause to be transferred from the SellerÂ’s Cafeteria Plan to the
PurchaserÂ’s Cafeteria Plan the excess, if any, of the aggregate accumulated
contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made during the
year in which the Transfer Time occurs by U.S. Transferred Employees over the
aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to the
U.S. Transferred Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the SellerÂ’s Cafeteria Plan
made during the year in which the Transfer Time occurs to U.S. Transferred
Employees exceed the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for
such year by the U.S. Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall cause such excess
to be transferred to Seller as soon as practicable following the Transfer
Time. On and after the Transfer Time, Purchaser shall assume and be solely
responsible for all claims by U.S. Transferred Employees under the SellerÂ’s
Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Transfer Time, that
have not been paid in full as of the Transfer Time, and following the Transfer
Time Purchaser shall hold Seller and the Seller Affiliates harmless from any
and all claims for reimbursement under the SellerÂ’s Cafeteria Plan with
respect to U.S. Transferred Employees that are not paid in full as of the
Transfer Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.10. _Bonus Plan_. Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate shall
make a prorated annual bonus payment to each U.S. Transferred Employee who is
not an Inactive Employee as of, and who remains employed through, the Global
Closing Date, the amount (if any) of which shall equal the product of the
applicable U.S. Transferred EmployeeÂ’s annual bonus amount (as described in
the next sentence) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the calendar year during which the Global Closing Date
occurs that elapse prior to the Global Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is 365. Seller may determine the annual bonus amount using any good
faith methodology (which need not be the same for each U.S. Transferred
Employee), including by basing such amount upon target bonus or upon actual
performance. Such prorated bonuses shall be paid no later than the date on
which Seller pays annual bonuses to similarly situated other employees of
Seller and its Affiliates, but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year during which the Global Closing
occurs. In the case of any U.S. Transferred Employee who is an Inactive
Employee as of the Global Closing Date, Seller or the applicable Seller
Affiliate will comply with all Applicable Law relating to the payment to such
employee of a prorated bonus with respect to the period that precedes the
Global Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.11. _Accrued Vacation._ For purposes of determining the number of
vacation days to which each U.S. Transferred Employee shall be entitled during
the calendar year in which the Transfer Time occurs, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its affiliates to, assume and honor all vacation days accrued or earned
but not yet taken by such U.S. Transferred Employee as of the Transfer Time.
To the extent that a U.S. Transferred Employee is entitled to be paid for any
vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such U.S. Transferred
Employee as of the Transfer Time, Purchaser shall discharge the liability for
such vacation days. As soon as practicable following the Global Closing Date,
but in any event no later than 30 days following the Global Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule of such accrued or earned
but not yet taken vacation days.

 



 

SECTION 6.12. _WARN Act._ Purchaser agrees to provide any required notice
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended (the "
_WARN Act_ "), and any similar state or provincial statute, and to otherwise
comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event
affecting U.S. Business Employees (including as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring on or after
the Global Closing Date. Purchaser shall not take any action after the Global
Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any U.S.
Business Employees by Seller or the Seller Affiliates that occurs on or before
the Global Closing Date to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" or
group termination under the WARN Act or any similar statute, or that would
create any liability or penalty to Seller or the Seller Affiliates for any
employment terminations under Applicable Law. Seller shall notify Purchaser
prior to the Global Closing of any layoffs of any U.S. Business Employees in
the 90-day period prior to the Global Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and the Seller Affiliates with respect to any liability
under the WARN Act or similar statute arising from the actions of Purchaser on
or after the Global Closing Date (including as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

SECTION 6.13. _China Business Employees and China Dispatched Employees._ (a)
No later than the earlier of (i) 10 days following the date on which the
Branch has been established and (ii) 30 days prior to the China Closing Date,
(x) Purchaser or the Branch shall offer employment (which shall include
PurchaserÂ’s compliance with PurchaserÂ’s covenants set forth in this Section
6.13), effective as of 12:01 am local time on the China Closing Date (the "
_China Transfer Time_ "), to each of the China Business Employees and (y)
Purchaser or the Branch shall execute an agreement with Seller and the Agency
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the " _Assignment Agreement_ ") to
the effect that, effective as of the China Transfer Time, (A) Purchaser or the
Branch accepts and assumes all the rights and obligations of Seller and its
affiliates under the Service Agreement and (B) Seller and its affiliates are
released from all their obligations under the Service Agreement.

 



 

(b) Effective as of the China Transfer Time, each China Business Employee who
signed an agreement (the " _Tri-Party Agreement_ ") in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit I (each, a " _China Transferred Employee_ ") shall cease to
be an employee of Seller or any Seller Affiliate. Purchaser or the Branch
shall enter into a new employment contract with each China Transferred
Employee within 10 days following the China Transfer Time.

 



 

(c) Upon execution of the Assignment Agreement by and among Purchaser or the
Branch, Seller and the Agency, and effective as of the China Transfer Time,
each China Dispatched Employee shall cease to be dispatched to Seller and each
China Dispatched Employee who agrees to be dispatched to Purchaser or the
Branch

 



      
 

 



 

(each, a " _China Transferred Dispatched Employee_ ") will be dispatched for
the purposes of providing services to Purchaser or the Branch.

 



 

(d) For the two-year period immediately following the China Transfer Time,
Purchaser or the Branch shall provide (which may include doing so through the
Agency) to each China Transferred Employee and each China Transferred
Dispatched Employee terms and conditions of employment that are no less
favorable, and types and amounts of compensation and benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate, in each case, to those provided by Seller (in
respect of the China Transferred Employees) and the Agency (in respect of the
China Transferred Dispatched Employees) immediately prior to the China
Transfer Time.

 



 

(e) From and after the China Transfer Time, each China Transferred EmployeeÂ’s
years of service with Seller shall be recognized by Purchaser or the Branch,
and Purchaser or the Branch shall give each China Transferred Employee full
credit for all purposes (including entitlement to sick leave, annual leave,
etc.), subject to Applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and
Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should
not constitute a separation or termination of any China Transferred Employee
prior to the China Transfer Time or severance of employment of any China
Transferred Employee or a termination of the Service Agreement, in each case,
prior to or upon the occurrence of the China Transfer Time, and Seller and
Purchaser intend that the China Transferred Employees and the China
Transferred Dispatched Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted
employment or engagement, as applicable, immediately before and immediately
after the China Transfer Time.

 



 

(g) Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and each of its respective directors, officers, and employees
from, any and all Losses that may result in respect of claims made by any
China Business Employees or China Dispatched Employees for severance or other
separation benefits (including claims for wrongful dismissal, notice of
termination of employment, pay in lieu of notice or statutory economic
compensation) or claims made by the Agency under the Service Agreement, or
claims made by any China Dispatched Employee based on the de facto engagement
relationship with PRC Seller, each arising out of, relating to or in
connection with (i) the failure of Purchaser, any affiliate thereof or the
Branch to offer employment to, or continue the employment of, any China
Business Employee (A) in accordance with this Section 6.13 or (B) on terms

Branch in accordance with this Section 6.13 or the termination of the Service
Agreement by Purchaser, the applicable affiliate thereof or the Branch
following the China Transfer Time or (v) SellerÂ’s Termination of the Service
Agreement due to the fact that it cannot be transferred to Purchaser, any
affiliate thereof or the Branch.

 



 

SECTION 6.14. _Liabilities._ Except for Losses that transfer to Purchaser or
any affiliate thereof or the Branch pursuant to Applicable Law or as otherwise
specifically provided in this Article VI, effective as of the Global Closing
(in respect to the U.S. Business Employees) or the China Closing (in respect

(c) _Additional Condition to China Obligation of Seller._ The obligation of

(i) _Ancillary Agreements._ Each of the Manufacturing Agreement, the China
Purchase Agreement, the China Land Transfer Agreement and the China Property
Transfer Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by Purchaser (or the
applicable affiliate thereof) and shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

SECTION 7.05. _Frustration of Closing Conditions._ Neither Purchaser nor
Seller may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VII

occur, as required by Section 5.04.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event of termination by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this

performance by any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.

 _Indemnification_

 



 

SECTION 9.01. _Indemnification by Seller._ Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.04, from and after the Global Closing or the China Closing,
as applicable, Seller shall be liable for and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and each of its affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the
" _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all claims, losses,
damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses including reasonable third-party
legal fees and expenses and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or
settlement of the foregoing (collectively, " _Losses_ "), suffered or incurred

(i) any breach (x) as of the Global Closing Date, of any representation or
warranty of Seller with respect to the Global Business contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and (y) as of the China Closing Date, of
any representation or warranty of Seller with respect to the China Business
contained in this Agreement, in each case, without giving effect, solely for
purposes of determining the amount of any Losses associated therewith (and

has

 



      
 

 



 

occurred), to any materiality or Business Material Adverse Effect qualifier
contained therein;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement contemplated to be performed prior to the date of such

the China Closing;

 



 

(iii) any claim or Proceeding relating to or in connection with the matters
set forth in Section 3.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, whether commenced
prior to or after the Global Closing, to the extent such Losses result
primarily from the infringement of applicable Intellectual Property by Seller
prior to the Global Closing and arise from (x) a final, judicially-determined,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) a written
settlement agreement entered into by Purchaser with SellerÂ’s prior written
consent;

 



 

(iv) any Retained Liability after the Global Closing (in the case of Retained
Liabilities that are retained by Seller in connection with the Global Closing)
and after the China Closing (in the case of Retained Liabilities that are
retained by Seller in connection with the China Closing); and

 



 

(v) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller or any

person retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser._ From and after the Global

and hold harmless Seller and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and

any Loss for which indemnification may be provided under more than one
provision of this Section 9.02) to the extent arising or resulting from any of
the following:

 



 

(i) any breach as of the Global Closing Date or the China Closing Date of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, without giving effect, solely for purposes of determining
the amount of any Losses associated therewith (and not, for the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of determining if such a breach has occurred), to any
materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect qualifier contained therein;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement contemplated to be performed prior to the date of such
breach, _provided_ that breaches of covenants relating to the China Business
or the China Acquisition shall only be subject to indemnification following
the China Closing;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) any Assumed Liability after the Global Closing (in the case of Assumed
Liabilities assumed in connection with the Global Closing) and after the China
Closing (in the case of Assumed Liabilities assumed in connection with the
China Closing);

 



 

(iv) any breach by Purchaser (or any affiliate thereof) of Section 2.04(b);

SECTION 9.03. _Indemnification Procedures._ (a) _Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Third Party Claims._ If any party (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of
any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under Section 9.01
or 9.02 (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written
notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount
thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant notices and
documents (including court papers) evidencing such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in reasonable detail;
_provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give prompt notice to
the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party will
have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice by written notice of such
assumption delivered to the Indemnified Party within 45 days following the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s receipt of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim that seeks the imposition of criminal penalties
or other sanctions that would be reasonably expected to materially and
adversely affect the Business. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel
(not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party) at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party will not (A) admit to any wrongdoing or (B) consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such written consent will not be withheld or delayed
unreasonably) and (iv) all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof, including the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not
file any papers, admit any liability with respect to, or consent to the entry
of any Judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to or otherwise
compromise or discharge the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. The parties will act in good faith to
minimize Losses and mitigate damages from Third Party Claims and will act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any Judgment
that was consented to without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims._ The Indemnified Party will
promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with written notice of its discovery
of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against
or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise to the claim
of indemnity pursuant hereto, with such written notice stating the nature,
basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the
relevant notices and documents (including court papers) evidencing such matter
and the basis for indemnification sought and otherwise in reasonable detail;
_provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give prompt notice
to the Indemnifying Party shall not affect the Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party will
have 45 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the
claim to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably
cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any
claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such
matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and
resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with
respect to such matters.

 



 

SECTION 9.04. _Limitations on Indemnification._ (a) Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article IX, (i) neither party shall be liable,
pursuant to Section 9.01(i), 9.01(ii), 9.01(iii), 9.02(i) or 9.02(ii), as
applicable, unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing within the
applicable survival period, failing which such claim shall be waived and
extinguished, (ii) neither party shall be liable, pursuant to Section 9.01(i)
or 9.02(i) (as applicable, and other than in connection with the breach of a
Fundamental Representation or in the case of fraud), for (x) any Losses
suffered by any Indemnified Party unless the aggregate of all such Losses
suffered by such Indemnified Party exceeds,

 



      
 

 



 

on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $14,000,000, and then only to the
extent of any such excess, or (y) any individual items where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $25,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for
purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x), (iii) the aggregate
liability of a party hereunder, pursuant to Section 9.01(i) or 9.02(i), as
applicable, for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees (other than in
connection with the breach of any Fundamental Representation or in the case of
fraud) or the Seller Indemnitees (other than in the case of fraud) shall in no
event exceed $140,000,000, (iv) the aggregate liability of a party hereunder,
pursuant to Sections 9.01(i), 9.01(ii), 9.01(iii), 9.02(i) or 9.02(ii), as
applicable, for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees, as applicable, shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price and
(v) neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for indirect, special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by such other party
resulting from such first partyÂ’s breach of its representations, warranties or
covenants hereunder (except to the extent that any such damages are awarded to
a third party in a Third Party Claim). Any Loss for which a party would
otherwise be obligated to provide indemnification hereunder will be offset to
the extent (but only to the extent) such Loss is reflected in an adjustment to
the Global Closing Date Payment or the China Closing Date Payment, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 2.03(c). The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any document
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Global Closing solely for
purposes of this Article IX as follows: (i) the representations and warranties
in Articles III (other than the Fundamental Representations) and IV shall
survive for 18 months following the Global Closing, (ii) Fundamental
Representations (other than Section 3.07(a)) shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, (iii) Section 3.07(a)
shall survive for 5 years following the Global Closing, (iv) the covenant in
Section 5.02 shall not survive the Global Closing and (v) the other covenants
set forth herein shall survive the Global Closing pursuant to the terms
thereof. " _Fundamental Representations_ " shall mean the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.01 (entitled "Organization and Standing"),
3.02 (entitled "Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability") and 3.03
(entitled "No Conflicts or Violations; No Consents or Approvals Required"),
clause (a) of Section 3.07 (entitled "Intellectual Property") and the first
sentence of each of Sections 3.05(a) and 3.06(b).

 



 

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by acting in good faith to
mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. In the event that Purchaser
or Seller shall fail to make such good faith efforts to mitigate or resolve
any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any person for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
obligations or expenses that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided
if Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 



 

(c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, (i) other than the
representations and warranties of Seller specifically contained in Article III
of this Agreement, none of Seller, any of its affiliates or any other person
has made any representation or warranty either expressed or implied (A) with
respect to the Business,

 



      
 

 



 

the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements or (B) as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Business, the Transferred
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Ancillary Agreements furnished or made available to Purchaser and its
representatives, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or
warranty from Seller, any Seller Affiliate or any other person in determining
to enter into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and (iii) Purchaser shall have no claim or right
to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX and none of Seller, any of its
affiliates or any other person shall have or be subject to any liability to
Purchaser or any other person with respect to any information, documents or
materials furnished by Seller, any of its affiliates or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors to Purchaser,
including the Confidential Memorandum dated October 2012 prepared by Lazard
Freres and Co. LLC and any information, documents or material made available to
Purchaser and its representatives in certain "data rooms", management
presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements (it being understood that
this clause (iii) does not supersede or otherwise affect the representations
and warranties of Seller specifically contained in Article III of this
Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
(a) neither Seller nor any of the Seller Affiliates makes any representations
or warranties relating to the maintenance, repair, condition, design,
performance or marketability of any Transferred Asset, including
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and (b) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that it shall obtain rights in the Transferred Assets
in their present condition and state of repair, "as is" and "where is".

 



 

(d) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Global Closing
occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the Business, the
Transferred Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Retained
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements (other than (i) a claim for payment due pursuant to Section

in this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby waives,
from and after the Global Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than (i) a claim for payment due pursuant to Section 2.03(c),
(ii) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud, (iii) claims for
injunctive or other equitable relief, solely with respect to Sections 2.04 and
5.05, (iv) claims for injunctive or other equitable relief arising under the
Excluded Technology License, the Transitional Trademark License or the Patent
License or (v) prior to consummation of the China Closing, claims for
injunctive or other equitable relief relating to the China Acquisition or the
China Business) Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnitee may have against
Seller or any of its affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers
and employees arising

 



      
 

 



 

under or based upon this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, any Federal, state, provincial,
local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, common law or
otherwise (including with respect to environmental matters generally and any
matters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act) (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article IX).

 



 

SECTION 9.05. _Additional Environmental Procedures Limitations._
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, with respect to any
indemnification claim by Purchaser under Section 9.01 for Losses arising under
or relating to any Retained Environmental Liability or any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.14(d) or otherwise
relating to any Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits or Hazardous
Materials or any claim relating thereto, (a) the Seller shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to manage and/or assume the control of any
investigation, sampling, cleanup or other responsive or remedial action ("
_Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ that, (i) in no case shall such Remedial
Action unreasonably interfere with operations, as then currently conducted, by
Purchaser at any Transferred Real Property; (ii) such Remedial Action shall be
conducted by a licensed environmental consultant reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser and Seller; (iii) the Seller shall provide Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on all work plans or submissions to any
Governmental Entity relating to any such Remedial Action (provided that the
Seller shall have the right to make all final decisions with respect to such
work plans and comments); (iv) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser with respect
to any Losses for physical damage to PurchaserÂ’s property or facility or
personal injury directly caused by Seller after the applicable Closing Date
while accessing any Transferred Real Property for the purpose of exercising
SellerÂ’s management and/or control of the Remedial Action; and (v) the
Remedial Action shall be conducted in accordance with Environmental Law and
shall not result in any Judgment or legally-binding agreement with a third
party that imposes any obligations or liabilities on Purchaser without
PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
(b) Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its consultants with access to any
Transferred Real Property that may be reasonably necessary in connection with
such management and/or control, except Seller and its consultants must obtain

use restrictions, as appropriate); or (ii) directly arise from any (A)
contribution to or exacerbation of such Losses caused by Purchaser after the
Global Closing Date (with respect to the Global Transferred Assets) or the
China Closing Date (with respect to the China Transferred Assets), (B) closure

by Applicable Law, (x) conducted in response to a Proceeding against Purchaser

human health and safety from a condition that poses an imminent and
substantial danger thereto.

 



 

SECTION 9.06. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments._ The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Loss (provided that an Indemnified Party shall have no
affirmative obligation to seek recovery under any insurance policies).

 



 

SECTION 9.07. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification._ For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective
affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an

ARTICLE X

 



 

 _Tax Matters_

 



 

SECTION 10.01. _Tax Matters._ (a) The parties shall determine an allocation of
a portion of the total consideration among certain of the Transferred Assets
in accordance with Section 10.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) At least five (5) days prior to the China Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Purchaser with an asset valuation report on the Transferred Assets
identified in the China Purchase Agreement with a detailed breakdown on each
category of such Transferred Assets prepared by an asset valuation institute
qualified to conduct asset valuation in the PeopleÂ’s Republic of China. Any
adjustments to the China Purchase Price or the China Final Purchase Price that
relate to such Transferred Assets shall be allocated by the parties in
accordance with such asset valuation report. The costs and expenses for
preparing such asset valuation report shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller.

 



 

(c) Except as described in Section 10.01(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
Seller (and its affiliates) and Purchaser (and its affiliates) agree to file
all Tax Returns consistent with the final versions of (i) any allocation
agreed upon by the parties pursuant to Section 10.01(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the valuation report described in Section
10.01(b).

 



 

(d) In the case of any Straddle Period with respect to a Property Tax, (i) the
amount of such Property Tax for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to
the amount of such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that is in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be the
responsibility of Seller and (ii) the amount of such

 



      
 

 



 

Property Tax for the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that is in
the Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period, and shall be the responsibility of Purchaser.
The party that has the primary obligation to do so under Applicable Law shall
file any Tax Return that is required to be filed in respect of Taxes described
in this Section 10.01(d), and that party shall pay the Taxes shown on such Tax
Return. To the extent any such Taxes paid by Purchaser (or any refund of Taxes
received by Purchaser) is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any such
Taxes paid by Seller (or any refund of Taxes received by Seller) is allocable
to the Post-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser or Seller (as applicable) shall pay
to the other party such proportionate amount promptly after the payment of
such Taxes (or the receipt of any such refund).

 



 

SECTION 10.02. _Transfer Taxes_. (a) Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in
timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in
connection with PurchaserÂ’s payment of Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser,
as appropriate, shall execute and deliver, and Seller shall cause each of the
Seller Affiliates, as appropriate, to execute and deliver, all instruments and
certificates reasonably necessary to enable the other to comply with any
filing requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) (i) The parties shall be responsible for certain Transfer Taxes as set
forth in Section 10.02(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. (ii)
Notwithstanding Section 10.02(b)(i), Purchaser (and its affiliates) shall be
responsible for, and shall pay to the applicable Taxing Authority or Seller,
as applicable, on the applicable Closing Date (or, if later, at the time such
Tax becomes due and payable under Applicable Law) any Recoverable Transfer
Taxes. At least fourteen (14) days prior to each applicable Closing Date,
Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule (the " _Recoverable Transfer
Tax Schedule_ "), based on a good faith estimate, of each Recoverable Transfer
Tax arising in connection with the applicable Closing and Seller shall make
any changes to the Recoverable Transfer Tax Schedule as reasonably requested
by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that such estimate shall not limit
PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this Section 10.02(b)(ii). (iii) The affiliate
of Purchaser that is purchasing the Canada Transferred Assets hereunder shall
provide its GST/HST and, if applicable, QST registration numbers to Seller on
or prior to the Global Closing.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees to retain all records relating to the finances and Taxes
