ARTICLE 2

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Assets_.

 

On the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, Seller
agrees to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, accept and pay
for, the Assets.

2.2 _Assets Subject to Existing Agreements and Legal Requirements_.

The sale, transfer and conveyance of the Assets to Purchaser will be
made subject to, and subject to Purchasers rights and remedies under this
Agreement, Purchaser agrees to accept the Assets subject to, and agrees to be
bound to and to perform, to the extent transferable, any and all reservations,
exceptions, limitations, contracts, assignments, leases and subleases,
farmout agreements, joint or unit operating agreements, pooling agreements,
letter agreements, production processing or handling agreements, interconnect,
transportation, gas sales, metering and allocation, pooling or unitization
agreements, easements, rights-of-way and all other agreements or instruments
pertaining to the Assets, including, but not limited to, those (i) that are
of record with the Pennsylvania Secretary of Commonwealth or any county
office, (ii) that have been disclosed or delivered to Purchaser for its review
prior to Closing, or that are referred to therein, (iii) __ that are listed
or referred to on any Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement, or (iv) __ that
were included in the Data Room made available to Purchaser by Seller, but
excluding any of the foregoing pertaining to, or constituting, any Excluded
Asset (collectively, the " _Basic Documents_ ").

 

2.3 _Purchase Price_.

 

The total purchase price for the Assets shall be Five Hundred Forty-One
Million Dollars ($541,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ ")
consisting of (i) __ the Unadjusted Cash Consideration and (ii) if Purchaser
makes a Stock Election pursuant to Section 2.5, the Stock Consideration.
The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be payable at Closing as provided in
Section 5.3, and shall be subject to adjustments as provided for in Article 3
and Article 8, and as are reflected in the Preliminary Accounting and the
Final Accounting (the Unadjusted Purchase Price, as so adjusted, being the "
_Final Purchase Price_ ").

Schedule 2.3 sets forth Purchasers good faith allocation of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price among the Oil and Gas Interests and Midstream Assets for all
purposes under this Agreement (with respect to any of the Assets, such value
is referred to herein as the " _Allocated Value_ " and collectively, the "
_Allocated Values_ "). Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make
no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

Payments to be made following the Closing under this Agreement shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business
Days after the final determination is made that such payments are due and
payable (pursuant to wire transfer instructions designated in advance by the
receiving Party or Parties to the paying Party or Parties in writing) for the
account of the respective receiving Party or Parties.

 



20

    

2.4 _Performance Deposit_.

 

Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer to
Seller Twenty-Seven Million Fifty Thousand Dollars ($27,050,000) in good and
immediately available funds, as a performance deposit (the " _Performance
Deposit_ ") on the Assets. The Performance Deposit shall be paid by wire
transfer to Seller using the following instructions:

 

Account Name: [omitted from filed copy]

 

Bank Name: [omitted from filed copy]

 

Street Address: [omitted from filed copy]

 

City, State ZIP: [omitted from filed copy]

 

Routing Number: [omitted from filed copy]

 

Account Number: [omitted from filed copy]

 

This Performance Deposit is solely to assure the performance of Purchaser
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Purchaser fails,
refuses or is unable for any reason (including failure to obtain financing) to
close the transaction in accordance with the terms hereof, Seller shall have
the right, as its sole remedy, to retain the Performance Deposit as expressly
provided in Section 13.2(b). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the
first sentence of Section 13.1, or 13.1(a), (b), (c) or (e), Seller shall
return the Performance Deposit to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt of the notice of termination.

2.5 _Stock Election_. Purchaser shall have the right to elect to pay up
to $150,000,000 of the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing through the
issuance by NFGC to Seller of up to 3,849,114 shares of NFGC Common Stock
valued at the Share Price, by providing Seller written notice thereof not
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Stock
Election_ "). Such notice shall indicate the number of whole shares of NFGC
Common Stock to be delivered to Seller at Closing as part of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Stock Election is exercised, then the number of shares of NFGC Common
Stock delivered to Seller at Closing shall be the Stock Consideration as set
forth in such Stock Election notice delivered to Seller, and all adjustments
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as provided for in Article 3 and Article 8,
and as are reflected in the Preliminary Accounting and the Final Accounting,
shall be made to the Unadjusted Cash Consideration (the Unadjusted Cash
Consideration, as so adjusted, the " _Final Cash Consideration_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser has timely made the Stock Election but NFGC
is unable or unwilling to issue all or any portion of the Stock Consideration
at Closing as required under Section 5.3(e), then the calculation of the
Unadjusted Cash Consideration payable by the Purchaser at the Closing
in accordance with Section 5.3(d) shall reflect the actual number of shares
of NFGC Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration issued to Seller at
the Closing.

 

2.6 _Qualified Intermediary_.

 

Seller and Purchaser hereby agree that this transaction may be completed as a
like-kind exchange and that each Party will assist in completing the sale as
a like-kind exchange. As a like-kind exchange, Seller and Purchaser agree that
Purchaser, in lieu of the purchase of the Assets from Seller for the cash
consideration provided herein, shall have the right at any time prior to
Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a
designated qualified intermediary as defined in Treasury Regulation Section __
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) (a " _Qualified Intermediary_ ") in order

 



21

    

 to accomplish the transaction in a manner that will comply, either in whole
or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section
1031 of the Code. Likewise, Seller shall have the right at any time prior to
Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a
Qualified Intermediary for the same purpose. In the event any Party assigns
its rights under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.6, such Party
agrees to notify the other Parties in writing of such assignment at or before
Closing. If Seller assigns its rights under this Agreement for this purpose,
Purchaser agrees to (i) consent to Sellers assignment of its rights in this
Agreement in the form reasonably requested by the Qualified Intermediary, and
(ii) pay the Final Purchase Price for the Assets into a qualified escrow or
qualified trust account at Closing as directed in writing. If Purchaser
assigns its rights under this Agreement for this purpose, Seller agrees to (i)
consent to Purchasers assignment of its rights in this Agreement in the form
reasonably requested by the Qualified Intermediary, (ii) accept the Final
Purchase Price for the Assets from the qualified escrow or qualified trust
account at Closing, and (iii) at Closing, convey and assign directly to
Purchaser the Assets that are the subject of this Agreement upon satisfaction
of the other conditions to Closing and other terms and conditions hereof.
Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that any assignment of this
Agreement shall not increase the costs, expenses or liabilities of a Party as
a result of the other Partys assignment of this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary, shall not release either Party from any of their respective
liabilities and obligations to each other under this Agreement, and that
neither Party represents to the other that any particular Tax treatment will
be given to either Party as a result thereof.

2.7 _Contingent Payments_. In the event that Purchaser makes a Stock
Election, then, as additional consideration for the Assets, Purchaser shall
make the Contingent Payments to Seller as follows:

 

(a) If the Calendar Year Average NYMEX Price for calendar year 2021 is
equal to or greater than $2.75/MMBtu, then Purchaser shall pay Seller an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Share Price multiplied by the number
of shares of NFGC Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration (such
payment, the " _First Contingent Payment_ ") in accordance with Section
2.7(c)(i).

(b) If the Calendar Year Average NYMEX Price for calendar year 2022 is
equal to or greater than $2.75/MMBtu, then Purchaser shall pay Seller an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Share Price multiplied by the number
of shares of NFGC Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration (such
payment, the " _Second Contingent Payment_ ") in accordance with Section
2.7(c)(ii).

 

(c) Not later than ten (10) Business Days following the end of each of
calendar year 2021 and 2022, as applicable, Purchaser shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to Seller a written statement setting forth Purchasers
calculation of the Calendar Year Average NYMEX Price for such calendar year.
The Contingent Payments, if any, shall be paid as follows:

(i) on January 31, 2022 (or such later date as mutually agreed upon by the
Parties), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the First Contingent Payment, if such
Contingent Payment is owed;

 



22

    

(ii) on January 31, 2023 (or such later date as mutually agreed upon by
the Parties), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Second Contingent Payment, if
such Contingent Payment is owed; and

 

(iii) all Contingent Payments shall be made by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the bank account(s) designated by Seller in writing.

(d) Seller shall have the right to dispute Purchasers calculation of any
Calendar Year Average NYMEX Price determined in accordance with Section 2.7(c)
by delivering written notice of such dispute to Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days of Purchasers delivery of its calculation of the applicable
Calendar Year Average NYMEX Price. Any such dispute shall be resolved pursuant
to Section 16.2 of this Agreement. If any dispute is pending at the time a
Contingent Payment is owed, Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay such
Contingent Payment until the date that is two (2) Business Days following the
date of the final resolution of such dispute in accordance with Section 16.2.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser does not make a Stock
Election, then Purchaser shall have no obligation to make the Contingent
Payments to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.7.

 

(f) Any Contingent Payments made pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for the Assets for
federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE 3

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

3.1 _Definition of Environmental Defect_.

 

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Environmental Defect_ " means, with
respect to any of the Assets, any (a) non-compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws or (b) condition that exists with respect to the air, land,
soil, surface, subsurface strata, surface water, ground water or sediments
that causes any Assets to be subject to obligations to perform any
investigation, monitoring, response, removal, construction, closure, disposal
or other remedial action under Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the following shall not be considered to be an Environmental
Defect: (i) __ any Retained Obligation, (ii) __ any condition,
contamination, liability, loss, cost, expense or claim related to NORM or
asbestos except to the extent currently resulting in non-compliance with, or
any remedial obligation under, Environmental Laws, (iii) __ all obligations
and liabilities for plugging, abandonment and restoration obligations as
described in Section __ 10.2 except to the extent currently resulting in
non-compliance with Environmental Laws, and (iv) __ the matters set forth on
Schedule 6.1(l).

 

3.2 _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) If, as a consequence of its Pre-Acquisition Review, Purchaser desires
to assert a claim of an Environmental Defect with respect to any Assets,
Purchaser must deliver claim notices to Seller (each an " _Environmental
Defect Notice_ ") no later than sixty (60) days after the Execution Date but
in any event at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date

 



23

    

 (such cut-off date being the " _Defect Claim Date_ "). Each Environmental
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
alleged Environmental Defect(s) reasonably sufficient for Seller to determine
the basis of the alleged Environmental Defect, including, at a minimum, the
relevant Environmental Law citation, (ii) identification of the Asset(s)
adversely affected by the Environmental Defect (each an " _Environmental
Defect Property_ "), (iii) all documents upon which Purchaser relies for its
assertion of an Environmental Defect, including, at a minimum,
supporting documents reasonably sufficient for Seller (as well as any
environmental engineering consultant hired by Seller) to identify the
existence of the alleged Environmental Defect(s), and (iv) Purchasers
reasonable estimate of the cost of eliminating, removing, curing or otherwise
addressing such Environmental Defect to the extent required by, and consistent
with, Governmental Authorities and Environmental Law in accordance with
Section 3.2(f) (the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ ") and the computations
and information upon which Purchasers belief is based, including any analysis
by any environmental engineering consultant firm hired by Purchaser. For the
avoidance of doubt, it shall be sufficient for Purchaser to satisfy clause
(iii) of this Section 3.2(a) by making such supporting documents available to
Seller for electronic download or by delivering to Seller an electronic hard
drive containing such supporting documents, in each case, within three (3)
Business Days of the Defect Claim Date. To give Seller an opportunity to
commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Purchaser agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all
Environmental Defects discovered by Purchaser during the preceding calendar
week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Defect Claim Date. 

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before 90 days after the Defect
Claim Date (the " _Cure Period_ "), any Environmental Defects for which Seller
has received an Environmental Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Defect
Claim Date. No reduction shall be made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price paid
at Closing with respect to any Environmental Defect unless Seller and
Purchaser have agreed to the existence of such Environmental Defect and the
applicable Environmental Defect Amount (and any such reduction shall be
subject to the limitations described in Section 3.2(h)). If, by the end of the
Cure Period Seller has not cured the Environmental Defects or Seller and
Purchaser cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure for any such
Environmental Defect, (ii) the Environmental Defect Amount, or (iii) whether
the alleged Environmental Defect constitutes an Environmental Defect, such
dispute(s) shall be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.2(g). Sellers election to attempt to cure an
Environmental Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under Section
3.2(g) and shall not constitute an admission against interests or a waiver
of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to
cure, the alleged Environmental Defect. During the Cure Period and following
the Closing, Seller shall conduct any cure of alleged Environmental Defects
using its own resources, personnel and advisors in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with Purchasers ownership and operation of the Assets
following Closing and in compliance with Purchasers HSSE policies to the
extent provided (or made available) to Seller in advance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser, at its expense, shall reasonably cooperate with
Sellers efforts including, without cost to Seller, granting Seller and its
consultants, advisers and contractors reasonable access to the Properties
after reasonable advance notice before accessing any Property (which shall be
not less than 48 hours advance notice), with full rights to conduct sampling
of soils and groundwater, for purposes of making any assessment or evaluation
of the alleged Environmental Defect and conducting any remediation that may be

 



24

    

 required, and making Purchasers personnel available after the Closing for
interviews conducted pursuant to Sellers cure efforts, answering reasonable
information requests and making records reasonably available for review
during normal business hours timely following Sellers request for same.
SELLER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS PURCHASER, AND EACH
MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS,
LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE
ATTORNEYS FEES), INCLUDING CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES
ATTRIBUTABLE TO PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO ACCESS TO THE ASSETS FOLLOWING CLOSING BY SELLER OR ANY MEMBER
OF THE SELLER GROUP FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING ENVIRONMENTAL CURATIVE ACTIONS
EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON,
BUT EXCLUDING AS SUCH MAY RESULT FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER GROUP.

 

(c) In the event that any Environmental Defect is not waived by Purchaser
or, subject to Section 3.2(b) and Section 3.2(g), cured prior to the end of
the Cure Period; (1) Purchaser may, in the event that its asserted
Environmental Defect Amount for an Environmental Defect Property equals or
exceeds the greater of (I) the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect
Property or (II) Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), cause Seller to
retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property, in which event,
Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property upon the reconveyance of such Environmental
Defect Property to Seller; and (2) Seller shall, after giving effect to
Purchasers right in foregoing clause (1) (if applicable), at its sole
election, and subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the
Aggregate Environmental Deductible, elect to:

 

(i) accept a reduction in the Unadjusted Purchase Price equal to the
Environmental Defect Amount, determined pursuant to Section 3.2(f) as being
the value of such Environmental Defect, in which event, Seller shall promptly
pay Purchaser an amount equal to the Environmental Defect Amount of such
Environmental Defect Property; or

 

(ii) if the Environmental Defect Amount for an Environmental Defect
Property equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of such Asset, retain the
entirety of the Property that is adversely affected by such Environmental
Defect, in which event, Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to such
Allocated Value.

 

(d) Upon Seller electing to retain a Property because of an Environmental
Defect pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(ii), the Parties shall complete any further
conveyancing or reconveyancing of property as is necessary to effect such
remedy. In the case of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the
relevant Property to or as directed by Seller using a form of assignment or
deed substantially similar to the applicable Assignment or Deed.

 

(e) Subject to Purchasers rights under Article 11, this Section 3.2 shall
be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to Environmental
Defects or any other matter or liability related to Environmental Laws or the
environmental condition of the Properties.

 



25

    

 In this regard and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if an Environmental Defect under this Section 3.2 results from any
matter which could also result in the breach of any representation or
warranty of a Seller as set forth in Section 6.1 (excluding the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1(e), 6.1(g) and
6.1(l)), then Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter as
an Environmental Defect to the extent permitted by this Section 3.2 and shall
be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any
such representation or warranty ( _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt,
that Purchaser shall be entitled to assert such matter as the basis of a
breach of the representations or warranties set forth in Sections 6.1(e),
6.1(g) and 6.1(l)).

 

(f) The Environmental Defect Amount resulting from an Environmental Defect
shall be an amount determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Environmental Defect Amount, that
amount shall be the Environmental Defect Amount;

 

(ii) the Environmental Defect Amount shall be based upon applicable
Environmental Laws in effect at the Defect Claim Date;

(iii) the estimated costs of remediating the Environmental Defect
shall not exceed the estimated costs of complying with the requirements of
Governmental Authorities or Environmental Law to remediate the Environmental
Defect; and

 

(iv) in addition, if applicable, the estimated costs of remediating the
Environmental Defect shall be based upon the costs to remediate and restore
the surface and groundwater of the Property to applicable standards consistent
with the current use of such surface and/or groundwater as of the Closing
Date.

 

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Environmental
Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts prior to the Closing, but the
Closing shall not be delayed because of failure to so agree. If, after the end
of the Cure Period, Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged
Environmental Defect, Environmental Defect Amount or whether an Environmental
Defect has been cured as provided herein (the " _Disputed Environmental
Matters_ ") such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively
and finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this
Section 3.2(g).

(i) Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the 10th Business
Day following the last day of the Cure Period an updated written description
meeting the requirements of Section 3.2(a), together with all supporting
documentation, of the Disputed Environmental Matters. By not later than
10 Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description of
the Disputed Environmental Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a
written response setting forth Sellers position with respect to the
Disputed Environmental Matters together with all supporting documentation.

(ii) By not later than 10 Business Days after Purchasers receipt of
Sellers written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed
Environmental Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration
of any such dispute(s) by written notice to

 



26

    

 Seller of any Disputed Environmental Matters (" _Final Disputed
Environmental Matters_ ") not otherwise resolved or waived that are to be
resolved by arbitration (the " _Environmental Arbitration Notice_ ").

(iii) The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator (the "
_Environmental Arbitrator_ "), determined as follows. The arbitrator shall be
a licensed environmental engineer or environmental attorney with at least ten
(10) years experience assessing the environmental condition of oil and gas
properties in the state where the Environmental Defect Property at issue is
located and who has not performed material services for either Party or their
Affiliates in the prior five (5) years. Within three (3) Business Days
following Sellers receipt of the Environmental Arbitration Notice, Seller and
Purchaser shall each exchange lists of five (5) acceptable, qualified
arbitrators. Within three (3) Business Days following the exchange of lists
of acceptable arbitrators, Purchaser and Seller shall select by mutual
agreement one arbitrator from the combined lists. If no agreement is reached,
Purchaser and Seller shall each, by 5:00 pm Central Time of the
second Business Day identify a single arbitrator from their original list of
five (5) acceptable arbitrators. The two (2) selected arbitrators shall then
together select a third arbitrator from the original lists within three (3)
Business Days following their selection. Such third arbitrator shall serve as
the Environmental Arbitrator.

 

(iv) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the
Environmental Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit one copy to the
Environmental Arbitrator of (A) this Agreement, with specific reference to
this Section 3.2(g), (B) the Purchasers written description of the Final
Disputed Environmental Matters together with the supporting documents that
were previously provided to Seller pursuant to Section 3.2(g)(i), (C) Sellers
written response to the Purchasers written description of the Final Disputed
Environmental Matters, together with the supporting documents that were
previously provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.2(g)(i), and (D) the
Environmental Arbitration Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following such
submissions, each of the Parties may submit one written response to the other
Partys submission. The Environmental Arbitrator shall resolve the Final
Disputed Environmental Matters based only on the foregoing submissions.
Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to submit additional
documentation to the Environmental Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the
other Party.

 

(v) The Environmental Arbitrator shall make its determination by written
decision within 30 Business Days following Sellers receipt of the
Environmental Arbitration Notice (the " _Environmental Arbitration Decision_
"). The Environmental Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section
3.2(g). The Environmental Arbitrator shall have no ex parte communications
with the Parties concerning the Final Disputed Environmental Matters. All
communications between any Party and the Environmental Arbitrator shall be
conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in
the same manner, or at a meeting to which all Parties have been invited and
of which such Parties have been provided at least five (5) Business Days
notice. The Environmental Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested
Third Parties, including counsel, to advise the Environmental Arbitrator,
but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any
such consultant shall not (i) be currently working as an employee or
consultant for either Party, nor be in discussions about potential future work
for either Party, (ii) have worked as an employee or

 



27

    

 consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the two (2)-year period
preceding the arbitration, or (iii) have any financial interest in the
dispute.

 

(vi) The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and
Environmental Defect Amounts and shall not be empowered to award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

 

(vii) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
preparing and presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator, including any costs
incurred by the Environmental Arbitrator that are attributable to the
consultation of any Third Party.

(viii) Following the issuance of the Environmental Arbitration Decision,
Purchaser shall have the right to make the remedy election (if applicable)
pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(1); _provided_ that if Purchaser is not entitled to
such election pursuant to the terms of Section 3.2(c)(1), then Seller shall
have the right to make its remedy election pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(2). Any
Environmental Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding as to that
Disputed Environmental Matter.

 

(ix) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 3.2
shall be decided by the Environmental Arbitrator with reference to the Laws
of the State of Texas. Any award of the Environmental Arbitrator may be
enforced against both Parties in the courts located in Harris County or
Houston, Texas, or any other state in which any Party holds or owns property
of any kind.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall there be any remedies available under this Section 3.2:

(i) for any Environmental Defect Amount with respect to an individual
Environmental Defect Property if such amount does not exceed Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the " _Individual Environmental Threshold_ ");
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that the Environmental Defect
Amounts for multiple Environmental Defects with respect to the same
Environmental Defect Property may be aggregated for purposes of satisfying the
Individual Environmental Threshold; and

 

(ii) unless the aggregate amount of all such Environmental Defect Amounts
(provided that each such Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Threshold and excluding any Environmental Defect Amounts with
respect to Environmental Defects cured by Seller) exceeds the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible, after which point, subject to the Individual
Environmental Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to remedies elected by
Seller in accordance with Section 3.2(c) only to the extent that such
Environmental Defects exceed the Aggregate Environmental Deductible. 

(iii) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or
the exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or
obligations in respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set
forth more fully in Section 15.7, time is of the essence in performing their
obligations and exercising their rights under this Section 3.2, and, as

 



28

    

 such, that subject to Section 15.11 each and every date and time by which
such performance or exercise is due shall be the firm and final date and time.

 

(i) If Seller agrees to remedy specific Environmental Defects under Section
3.2(b), then Purchaser agrees that at Sellers election, all negotiations and
contacts with Governmental Authorities for approval and review of such
remedial action shall be made by Seller with reasonable prior review and input
from Purchaser.

 

EXCEPT FOR PURCHASERS REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH OF SELLERS REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR FOR INDEMNITY UNDER ARTICLE
11, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE 3 CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS ENTIRE REMEDY WITH
RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.

 

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 3.2 AND SUBJECT TO PURCHASERS RIGHTS UNDER
ARTICLE 11, PURCHASER SHALL ACQUIRE THE PROPERTIES "WHERE IS" AND "AS IS"
WITH NO RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS FROM SELLER FOR ANY LIABILITIES,
COSTS OR EXPENSES RELATED TO THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL
RESOURCES). SUBJECT TO PURCHASERS RIGHTS UNDER THIS SECTION 3.2, ARTICLE 11
AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OF SELLERS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR
COVENANTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ACQUISITION OF THE PROPERTY CONTAINING SUCH
CONDITIONS "WHERE IS" AND "AS IS" SHALL CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS WAIVER AND
GENERAL RELEASE OF SELLER AND EACH MEMBER OF SELLER GROUP FROM ALL
LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES RELATED TO SUCH CONDITIONS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, CERCLA LIABILITY AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL
RESOURCES), WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT OR STATUTORY, REGARDLESS OF THE PAST
NEGLIGENCE OF SELLER OR ANY MEMBER OF SELLER GROUP, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLER OR ANY MEMBER
OF THE SELLER GROUP.

ARTICLE 4

 

TITLE MATTERS

 

4.1 _Exclusive Title Remedy_.

 

Purchaser represents that it has fully completed its title due diligence
investigation of the Assets and is not relying on any representation of
Seller with respect to title to the Assets other than as specifically set
forth in Section 6.1 of this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
limit the effectiveness of the special warranty of title contained in the
Assignments and Deed. Purchasers remedies for any breach of Sellers
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement or for indemnity
under Section 11.1(b) or with respect to Purchasers rights under the
special warranty of

 



29

    

 title contained in the Assignments and Deed, as applicable, are Purchasers
exclusive remedy against Seller with respect to title to the Assets.

 

4.2 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase_.

 

(a) Promptly, but no later than five (5) Business Days, after the Execution
Date, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of any
required consents to assignment that are set forth on Schedule 6.1(i)
requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase
or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 6.1(i) in compliance with the
terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights, which such notices
shall be in the form attached as Exhibit F. With respect to any required
consent to assignment, preferential right to purchase or similar right, in
each case, that would have been required to be set forth on Schedule 6.1(i)
had Seller had knowledge of such consent, preferential right or similar right
prior to the Execution Date, but which consent, preferential right or similar
right is not set forth on Schedule 6.1(i) and is discovered by Seller or
Purchaser prior to Closing, Seller shall send to the holder of each such
consent, preferential right or similar right a notice pursuant to the terms
of the prior sentence as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later
than five Business Days after discovery of any such consent, preferential
right or similar right). The consideration payable under this Agreement for
any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall
be the Allocated Value for such Asset. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (at no unreasonable out-of-pocket cost to Seller) to cause
such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or
similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior
to the Closing. Purchaser shall cooperate (at no unreasonable out-of-pocket
cost to Purchaser) with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents
to assignment and waivers of preferential rights. Solely with respect to
consents set forth on Schedule 6.1(i), at Closing, Purchaser will provide such
additional collateral or security to meet reasonable financial requirements
demanded by counterparties in order to obtain consents from such
counterparties. In the event Purchaser (or its designee) fails to provide such
reasonable adequate assurance to a counterparty or a counterparty reasonably
rejects such adequate assurance, Purchaser shall provide to Seller, at
Closing, either (i) an irrevocable standby letter of credit, commercial bank
guarantee, surety bond or similar credit support instrument that is issued by
a financial institution that has a credit rating of "A-" or better by
Standard and Poors Rating Group or Fitch Ratings Ltd. or "A3" or better by
Moodys Investor Service Inc. or (ii) a guaranty from a creditworthy entity
reasonably acceptable to Seller. Such credit support instrument shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Seller and in an amount reasonably determined by
Seller. Seller may draw upon (or seek payment under) such credit support
instrument in the event Purchaser (or its designee) does not fulfill the
obligations as to the Assets, as applicable.

 

(b) In the event that a consent requirement was not satisfied prior to
Closing:

 

(i) if such consent requirement is subject to a consent that is not a Hard
Consent, then Seller will assign such Asset to Purchaser at Closing and
Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser by reason of any inability or failure
to obtain any such consent to assignment, and Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend, and hold Seller Group harmless from any losses asserted against,
imposed upon or incurred by Seller Group resulting from the failure to obtain
such consent; and

 



30

    

(ii) if failure to obtain such consent would cause the assignment of the
Asset(s) affected thereby to be void or voidable or result in the termination
of (or right to terminate) a Mineral Interest, Surface Interest or Basic
Document under the express terms thereof or if any such consent is
expressly denied in writing (each such consent, a " _Hard Consent_ "), the
Parties will proceed with Closing without assigning such Asset(s) subject to
the Hard Consent. In the case of (A) Hard Consents identified on Schedule
6.1(i), the Unadjusted Purchase Price will not be adjusted at Closing, and
(B) any Hard Consents not identified on Schedule 6.1(i), the Unadjusted
Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such
Asset(s). The Asset(s) subject to any unobtained Hard Consents shall be held
by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Section
4.2(b); and

 

(iii) in the case of Sections 4.2(b)(ii)(A) and (B), Seller will continue
after the Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts (at no unreasonable
out-of-pocket cost to Seller) to obtain the consent within one (1) year after
the Closing so that such Asset can be transferred to Purchaser, upon receipt
of the consent. In the case of clauses (A) and (B) above, if such Hard Consent
is obtained within such one (1)-year period, then, seven (7) Business Days
after receiving such Hard Consent, (I) Seller shall transfer the Asset(s)
excluded at Closing due to such unobtained Hard Consent to Purchaser and (II)
in the case of clause (B) above, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Asset(s).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in cases
where a Hard Consent has not been obtained as of the Closing with respect to
a Basic Document and Purchaser is assigned the Assets (other than such Basic
Document) to which the Basic Document relates but the Basic Document is not
transferred to Purchaser, then the following shall apply: (i) Seller and
Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the Hard Consent so that such Basic Document can be transferred to
Purchaser upon receipt of the Hard Consent; (ii) the Basic Document shall be
held by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser; (iii) Purchaser shall pay all
amounts due thereunder; (iv) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Losses
under such Basic Document and for the performance of any obligations under
such Basic Document to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the
Assets necessary to perform under such Basic Document until such Hard Consent
is obtained and (v) until such time as Seller retains such Asset pursuant to
this Section 4.2(b) (if ever), INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD SELLER GROUP
HARMLESS FROM ANY MATTERS IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO ANY LOSSES ASSERTED AGAINST, IMPOSED UPON OR INCURRED BY SELLER GROUP: (1)
RESULTING FROM OR CAUSED BY PURCHASERS FAILURE TO PERFORM ALL OBLIGATIONS
UNDER, OR PAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE PURSUANT TO, ANY AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE ASSET;
(2) AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SELLER REMAINING A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT RELATED
TO THE ASSET THAT COULD NOT BE ASSIGNED AT CLOSING; OR (3) AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF SELLER PROVIDING PURCHASER ANY BENEFIT UNDER ANY AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE
ASSET UNTIL THE CONSENT TO ASSIGN IS SATISFIED OR THE AGREEMENT HAS
TERMINATED. Within ten (10) Business Days of receiving such Hard Consent,
Seller shall convey to Purchaser such Basic Document using a form of
assignment substantially similar to the Assignments, such assignment to be
effective as of the Effective Date.

 

(v) If any such Hard Consent is not obtained within one (1) year after
Closing, Purchaser may elect, in its sole discretion, to either: (A) receive
an assignment of such

 



31

    

 Asset and INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM ANY MATTERS
IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ASSIGNMENT in addition to any indemnification
obligations under Section 11.1(a)(iii), or (B) cause Seller to retain such
Asset subject to the unobtained Hard Consent. In the event of (B), Seller
shall have all rights available to Seller to terminate any agreement related
to the Asset and, if such unobtained Hard Consent is set forth on Schedule
6.1(i), Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any actual out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred in connection therewith.

 

(c) Until (i) consent is received from the Pennsylvania Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources for Seller to transfer its interest in the
DCNR Agreements to Purchaser and (ii) Seller assigns its interest in the DCNR
Agreements to Purchaser, Purchaser shall not access the properties that are
subject to the DCNR Agreements or perform any operations thereon without
Sellers prior written consent. However, Purchaser shall perform all
administrative and accounting obligations under the DCNR Agreements after the
Transition Services Agreement is terminated. If Seller is required to perform
any obligations under the DCNR Agreements before the agreements can be
transferred to Purchaser, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assist and cooperate with Seller to enable Sellers performance of
such obligations.

(d) If, prior to Closing, (i) the holder of a preferential right to
purchase elects not to purchase the applicable Asset or waives its right to
do so, or (ii) the time in which the preferential right to purchase may be
exercised has expired, then such Asset will be assigned to Purchaser at the
Closing in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement.

(e) If, prior to the Closing Date, a holder of a preferential right to
purchase notifies Seller that it elects to exercise its preferential right to
purchase with respect to the applicable Asset or the time period for
exercising such preferential purchase right has not expired, then (i) such
Asset will not be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and will be deemed an
Excluded Asset, and (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the
applicable Allocated Value for such retained Asset, provided, however, if
the holder of such preferential right to purchase fails to complete the
purchase of said Property (or portion thereof) within one hundred eighty (180)
days after the Closing Date, then Seller shall deliver such retained Assets to
Purchaser within three (3) Business Days following such one hundred eighty
(180)-day period and Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
amount by which the Unadjusted Purchase Price was reduced at Closing
in respect of such retained Asset.

(f) Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of the exercise of
any preferential right to purchase in respect of the Assets.

PURCHASERS REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH OF SELLERS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
OR COVENANTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FOR INDEMNITY UNDER ARTICLE 11 AND THE
SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE IN THE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENTS AND DEED
CONSTITUTE PURCHASERS ENTIRE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE TITLE TO THE ASSETS.

SUBJECT TO PURCHASERS RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 11 AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF
TITLE CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENTS AND DEED, PURCHASER SHALL ACQUIRE THE
ASSETS "WHERE IS" AND "AS IS" WITH NO

 



32

    

 RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS FROM SELLER FOR ANY DEFECT TO OR LIEN
OR ENCUMBRANCE UPON THE TITLE TO THE ASSETS.

material respects. Seller has valid and defensible title to, or a valid
leasehold interest in, all Midstream Surface Interests free and clear of all

subject to any rental, lease payment or royalty reasonably expected to exceed
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) annually. All of the Midstream Surface
Interests are legal, valid, binding and enforceable against 

 



39

    

 Seller and to Sellers Knowledge, the applicable counterparty thereto. There
is no existing material default by Seller or, to Sellers Knowledge, any
counterparties under any of the Midstream Surface Interests. The terms of all
Midstream Surface Interests permit Seller to transport Third Party
Hydrocarbons across such Midstream Surface Interests without payment of a fee
or royalty and without seeking consent from any Third Party.

account the age and history of use of such Midstream Assets, in good repair,
working order and operating condition and do not require any material
maintenance or repair services, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to be put

with applicable Law in all material respects and industry standard practice in
the areas in which they are operated or used.

 

(iv) (A) all Pipelines constructed by Seller or its Affiliates since
December 31, 2010 (and, to Sellers Knowledge, all other Pipelines) were

prudent operators of similarly situated midstream assets (taking into
account, where appropriate, all applicable Laws for pipelines designated as
transmission and regulated gathering) in the area in which the Midstream
Assets are located, and (B) all Pipelines that were designed and constructed
by Seller or its Affiliates since December 31, 2010 to be capable of operating
at a Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of 1440 PSIG or greater, as set
forth in Schedule 6.1(t), are free from any asset integrity issues which
would require any pressure derating. The pipeline pressure test records
summary provided to Purchaser in the VDR entitled "SWEPI Pipeline Pressure
Test Records Summary_3_10_20.xls" is true and correct in all material
respects. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.1(e), all permitting actions and

conducted continuously since December 31, 2010 in all material respects with
respect to the Midstream Assets.

 

(v) Seller has, in all material respects, valid and defensible title to, or
a valid leasehold interest in, all Midstream Equipment, Pipelines and other
personal property utilized in the ownership, use or operation of the Midstream
Assets, free and clear of all liens, defects and other encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances). Seller is not in default (and to Sellers
Knowledge no counterparty is in material default) under any lease for
Midstream Equipment or other personal property to which Seller is a party and

Midstream Assets. There are no Pipelines or other portions of any Midstream
Systems that are currently incomplete or under construction in any material
respects.

term limits that are renewable or extendable with the payment of fees
reasonably expected to be equal to or less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000). There is no existing material default by Seller or, to Sellers

_FERC_ ") as (i) a natural gas company under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.
Section 717, et seq., as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
(ii) an intrastate pipeline under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, 15
U.S.C. Section 3301, et seq., as amended and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, transporting gas in interstate commerce, or (iii) a common carrier
under the Interstate Commerce Act, as implemented by FERC pursuant to 49
U.S.C. Section 60502 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(w) _Non-Consent Operations_. As of the Execution Date, Seller has not
declined to participate in any operation or activity proposed with respect to
the Assets on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2 that could result in Sellers
interest in any Assets becoming subject to a penalty, non-payment or
forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such operation
or activity, except to the extent reflected in the net revenue interest and
working interest set forth on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2.

 

(x) _Investor Status; Independent Evaluation_. Seller is an "accredited

investment in the Stock Consideration, (ii) is able to bear the economic risk
of an investment in the Stock Consideration, (iii) has conducted its own
investigation of NFGC, (iv) confirms it has had access to information as it
deemed necessary to make its decision to acquire the Stock Consideration if
the Stock Election is exercised, and (v) confirms it has been offered the
opportunity to ask questions of NFGC and receive answers thereto, as it deemed
necessary in connection with the decision to acquire the Stock Consideration.
Seller further represents that it is not acquiring any Stock Consideration as
a nominee or agent or otherwise for any other person and was not formed for
the purpose of acquiring shares of NFGC Common Stock. Seller has relied
solely on the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and
in any Closing document and is not relying on any other communication (written
or oral) of NFGC or any of its Affiliates, as investment or tax advice or as
a recommendation to acquire the Stock Consideration, if any.

(y) _No Review_. Seller understands that no federal or state agency has
passed upon the merits of an investment in shares of NFGC Common Stock or made
any finding or determination concerning the fairness or advisability of such
an investment.

 

(z) _Restrictions on Transfer_.

 

(i) Seller is acquiring the Stock Consideration, if any, solely for
Sellers own account, for investment purposes, and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution of NFGC Common Stock in violation
of the Securities Act. Seller understands that the Stock Consideration, if
any, has not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities
Laws by reason of specific exemptions under the provisions thereof that depend
in part upon the investment intent of Seller and of the other representations
made by Seller in this Agreement. Seller understands that Purchaser and NFGC
are relying upon the representations and covenants in this Agreement (and any
supplemental information provided by Seller to Purchaser and NFGC expressly
for the purpose) for the purposes of determining whether this transaction
meets the requirements for such exemptions.

 



41

    

(ii) Seller understands that the Stock Consideration, if any, will
constitute "restricted securities" under applicable federal securities Laws
and that the Securities Act and the rules of the SEC provide in substance that
Seller may dispose of the Stock Consideration only pursuant to an effective
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration
requirements thereunder.

 

(iii) Seller agrees: (A) that Seller will not sell, assign, pledge, give,
transfer, grant a participation in or otherwise dispose of the Stock
Consideration, if any, or any interest therein, or make any offer or attempt
to do any of the foregoing (for purposes of this clause (iii), a " _transfer_
"), except pursuant to a registration of the Stock Consideration under the
Securities Act and all applicable state securities Laws, or in a transaction
that is exempt from such registration provisions, (B) that the certificates
(or electronic equivalent) representing any Stock Consideration will
initially bear a legend making reference to the foregoing restrictions, and
(C) that NFGC and its Affiliates will not be required to give effect to any
purported transfer of such Stock Consideration except in compliance with the
foregoing restrictions.

to be so filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2019
(collectively, the " _SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates (or, if
amended, as of the

 



46

    

 date of such amendment), the SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the respective applicable form requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and complied in all material respects with applicable accounting
standards. No SEC Document that has been filed prior to the date of this
representation has been made, after giving effect to any amendments or
supplements thereto and to any subsequently filed SEC Documents, in each case
filed prior to the date this representation is made, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the SEC Documents (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of NFGC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of its
applicable date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the SEC Documents (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, in all material respects, the results of operations, cash
flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the case may be, of NFGC and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to (A) such exceptions as are permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC and (B) normal year-end audit adjustments which have not been
and are not reasonably expected to be material individually or in the
aggregate), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

 

(iii) There were no liabilities or obligations of NFGC or any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, known,
asserted, matured or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or
reserved against in, a balance sheet of NFGC or in the notes thereto prepared
in accordance with GAAP as of December 31, 2019, other than liabilities or
obligations to the extent reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of NFGC as of December 31, 2019 (including the notes thereto).
Since December 31, 2019, no such liabilities or obligations have arisen other
than (A) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business or (B) liabilities that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material to NFGC.

 

(g) _Controls and Procedures_. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, NFGC has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the Knowledge of NFGC,
based upon its most recent evaluation, there are no material weaknesses in its
internal control over financial reporting or its disclosure controls and
procedures, each as defined under the applicable Exchange Act regulations.

 

(h) _NYSE Compliance_. NFGC has not received any notice from the NYSE of
delisting or noncompliance with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 

(j) _Legal Proceedings_. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, there
are no actions, suits, claims, investigations or other legal proceedings
pending or, to Knowledge of NFGC, threatened against NFGC or any of its
assets, except for any actions, suits, claims, investigations or other legal
proceedings which do not have or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an NFGC Material Adverse Effect.

 



47

    

(k) _Investment Company Act_. NFGC is not, and is not an Affiliate of,
and immediately after the Closing, will not be or be an Affiliate of, an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

 

(l) _Absence of Changes_. Since January 31, 2020, (a) there has not
occurred any change, event or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, an NFGC Material
Adverse Effect, (b) except to the extent reasonably required or advisable due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the business of NFGC and its subsidiaries has been
operated and maintained in the ordinary course of business consistent with
NFGCs past practices; and (c) there has not been any material change by NFGC
in accounting or Tax reporting principles, methods, or policies, except as
required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES.

 

7.1 _Access to Properties and Information_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that, as of the Execution Date, it has already
received from Seller (i) access to a virtual data room containing images of
certain documents, instruments and agreements relevant to Purchasers
examination of the Assets (such virtual data room and its contents as of one
(1) Business Day prior to the Execution Date, the " _Data Room_ "), (ii) the
opportunity to ask questions related to the Assets of certain managers and
employees of Seller and its Affiliates, (iii) the opportunity to conduct a
review of geological and geophysical data on workstations at the offices of
Seller, and (iv) drafts of the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement.

 

(b) Upon execution of and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser and its officers, employees, agents, consultants and authorized
representatives shall have the right, at reasonable times during normal
business hours, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, to reasonable access to
(i) the Assets, (ii) all Records in Sellers or any of its Affiliates
possession or control and (iii) Sellers and its Affiliates employees, in
each case, that are reasonably necessary to facilitate review without
unreasonable interruption to Sellers business and in compliance with
Sellers HSSE policies to the extent made available to Purchaser following
Purchasers request (the " _Pre-Acquisition Review_"). The scope of the Pre-
Acquisition Review includes:

(i) The right to enter all or any part of the Assets at any reasonable
time and with reasonable advance notice before accessing any Asset (which
shall be not less than 48 hours advance notice), and to inspect, inventory,
investigate, perform environmental assessments, study and examine the same
and the operations conducted thereon (an " _Environmental Site Assessment_ ")
(provided that Purchaser shall have no right to conduct any invasive
environmental sampling or testing on any Properties without the consent of
Seller, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion and may be
subject to any conditions); _provided, however_ , if, following the conduct of
any Environmental Site Assessment consistent with US EPA recognized standards
(e.g. ASTM E1527-13; E2247;-16 E1528-14e1), Purchasers Environmental
Professional, based on the findings and results of the Environmental
Site Assessment, identifies Recognized Environmental Conditions for which
further investigation, sampling or testing or other invasive investigation is
necessary to determine the existence or magnitude of an Environmental Defect
or Environmental Defect Amount, Purchaser may request to undertake further
investigation, sampling or testing or other invasive investigation activities,
which request shall be accompanied by a final version of the

 



48

    

 Environmental Site Assessment. Following the receipt of such request, Seller
shall elect, in its reasonable discretion, to permit or refuse to permit the
conduct of any such activities by Purchaser; _provided_ that, if Seller or
its Affiliate has the right to permit such activities and Seller denies
Purchasers reasonable proposal for further investigation, sampling, testing
or other invasive investigation, then Purchaser shall have the right to
exclude such Asset from the Assets to be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing, in
which event the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset; and

 

(ii) The right, subject to compliance with applicable Law, including the
HSR Act, to inspect and review at Sellers offices at reasonable times and
upon reasonable advance notice, all of the Records.

 

(c) Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall maintain the results of its
investigation, testing and evaluation and review of files and records,
confidential in accordance with and otherwise comply with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated October 29, 2019 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

(d) Purchaser shall provide Seller a copy of any final assessment reports
of or about the Assets, including, without limitation, any final reports,
data and conclusions developed pursuant to the Pre-Acquisition Review,
promptly after such assessment report has been furnished to or obtained by
Purchaser, and Seller shall be permitted in the presence of Purchaser to
discuss the portions of any such final assessment reports relating to asserted
Environmental Defects with the party who prepared such reports.

 

(e) While conducting the Pre-Acquisition Review, Purchaser and its
employees, agents and consultants shall abide by Sellers safety rules,
regulations and other operating policies applicable to such Properties that
are furnished to Purchaser by Seller prior to such Persons access.

 

7.2 _Notification of Breaches_.

 

Until the Closing,

 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains
Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on such Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect; _provided_ , that
Purchasers failure to provide such notice shall not be deemed to waive or
otherwise prejudice its rights to assert a breach of such
representations, warranties or covenants; and

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains Knowledge
that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material respect as
of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by Purchaser prior to or on such Closing Date has not been so
performed or observed in a material respect; _provided_ , that Sellers
failure to provide such notice shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise
prejudice its rights to assert a breach of such representations, warranties
or covenants.

 



49

    

Any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties that are untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the Execution Date and
the Closing Date, and any of Purchasers or Sellers covenants or agreements
to be performed or observed prior to the Closing Date that have not been so
performed or observed in any material respect, shall be considered not to have
occurred for all purposes of this Agreement to the extent that any such breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is (if curable) cured by
the Closing. 

7.3 _Operation of the Business_.

 

From the date of this Agreement until the Closing occurs, Seller will continue
to operate the Assets in the ordinary course of business and in material
compliance with all applicable Laws, including, without limitation,

in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) per operation, or
otherwise incur any other obligations or liabilities, other than in the
ordinary course of business and as would a prudent operator, except (i) to
the extent such matters are set forth on Schedule 7.3, to preserve the Assets
(including without limitation where needed to comply with any drilling
obligations needed to maintain any Mineral Interest), (ii) Seller shall be
free to continue its leasing, lease renewal or extension program in accordance
with Sellers past practice and as described on Schedule 1.2, and (iii) to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws;

Interest or where needed to comply with any drilling obligations needed to
maintain any Mineral Interest, propose the drilling of any additional wells,
or propose the deepening, plugging back or reworking of any existing wells;

 

(c) not sell, transfer or abandon any portion of the Assets other than

without the consent of Purchaser where needed to comply with Sellers HSSE
policies.

PURCHASER RELEASES SELLER AND EACH MEMBER OF SELLER GROUP FROM ANY
LIABILITY FOR SELLERS OR SELLER GROUP MEMBERS OWN NEGLIGENCE, INCLUDING

PURCHASER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER, AND EACH
MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES,

(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF
ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, BUT EXCLUDING AS SUCH MAY RESULT FROM THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP.

 

7.5 _Governmental Reviews_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that

undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) litigating, challenging or taking any other action with respect to
any judicial or administrative action or proceeding taken by any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
or (iii) divesting, selling or otherwise holding separate, or taking 

 



52

    

 any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with
respect to any of its or its respective Affiliates businesses, assets or
properties. Except for any filing fees that may be imposed by law on Seller,
Seller shall not be required to pay or reimburse Purchaser for any fees or
other payments to any Governmental Authority in connection with any such
actions, approvals, or consents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
will reimburse Seller for any filing fees required under the HSR Act in
connection with the issuance of the Stock Consideration.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, from the Execution Date until the Closing, with
respect to requirements of the HSR Act, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to:

 

(i) following approval of the other Parties, make or cause to be made any
filing required under the HSR Act (including any filing that is required, or
may be required, with respect to the Stock Consideration) as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days of
the Execution Date);

 

(ii) comply, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, with any requests
received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental
Authority under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or other

possession that is necessary in connection with such other Partys filings;

 

(iv) promptly inform the other Parties of any material communication from
or to, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority in respect of such filings or any review or investigation of the
transaction;

 

(v) subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, consult and
cooperate with the other Parties, including through the exchange of drafts
where permissible, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions made or submitted by
or on behalf of any Party to any Governmental Authorities relating to such
filings or any review or investigation of the transaction; and

 

(vi) use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration of the notice or
waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable
(including requesting early termination of the HSR Act waiting period).

 

(c) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve prior to
Closing any objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser, including by timely providing such information and
making available such personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request to
prepare for and participate in meetings with Governmental Authorities, and/or
to respond to any questions raised by Governmental Authorities.

 

If a Party intends to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority with respect to such filings, it shall give the other Party
reasonable prior notice of such meeting and permit the

 



53

    

 other Party to attend such meeting to the extent practicable and permitted
by such Governmental Authority.

 

7.6 _Operatorship; Guaranties; Consent Order_.

 

(a) Between the Execution Date and Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, in
the name of Purchaser or of its Affiliates, replacements for each of the
Seller Guaranties set forth on Schedule 6.1(s). At or prior to Closing,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller evidence of such replacements with all
applicable Governmental Authorities of such Seller Guaranties. Seller makes
no representation or warranty nor provides any assurance that Purchaser shall
succeed Seller as operator of any portion of the Properties. Purchaser agrees
that it will promptly take such actions as are necessary to become the
successor operator of those Properties now operated by Seller.

(b) If any Governmental Authority has not accepted Purchaser as operator
of any Assets (to the extent such acceptance is required by applicable Law) at
the time of Closing, then to the extent permissible under applicable Laws,
Seller shall act as operator of record of the Assets under the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement until such time as all applicable Governmental
Authorities approve Purchaser as operator of the Assets. If, within 120 days
from the date of Closing, any Governmental Authority has not accepted
Purchaser as operator of any Assets or Purchaser has not submitted written
evidence thereof to Seller, Shell shall have the right on written notice to
Purchaser to unwind this Agreement as to those Assets for which Purchaser has
not been approved as operator, in which case Purchaser shall assign to Seller
the Assets and Seller will reimburse Purchaser in an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Assets assigned to Seller, and such Assets shall be
deemed to be Excluded Assets for all purposes of this Agreement. Between the
Execution Date and Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to support Purchasers efforts to become successor operator (to the extent
permitted under applicable joint operating agreements) effective as of
Closing. PURCHASER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER AGAINST ALL
CLAIMS, LOSSES AND LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM PURCHASERS OPERATION
OF THE ASSETS DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN CLOSING AND PURCHASER OBTAINING
ANY NECESSARY APPROVALS FROM GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
SUCH CLAIMS ARISE FROM OR ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES.

 

(c) Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts (including
providing any collateral or security to meet reasonable financial
requirements required by the PDEP in connection therewith) to enter into an
agreement (the " _Replacement Consent Order_ ") on or before the date that is
one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the " _Consent Order
Replacement Deadline_ ") with the PDEP whereby Purchaser assumes all of
Sellers compliance obligations under the Consent Order and PDEP releases
Seller from all of its obligations under the Consent Order; _provided,
however_ , that Purchaser shall only assume the obligations under the Consent
Order to the extent required to operate the Assets following the Closing and
in no event shall Purchaser be responsible for any fines or penalties under
the Consent Order except to the extent assessed for Purchasers failure to
comply therewith following the Closing. If Purchaser fails to obtain a
Replacement Consent Order by the Consent Order Replacement Deadline for any
Wells that were subject to the Consent Order, Seller may elect to retain any
such Wells, and Seller shall plug, abandon, and decommission such Wells in
accordance with applicable Environmental Laws,

 



54

    

 rules or regulations, and in a manner consistent with generally accepted
industry practices, but Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the reasonable
actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller related to such plugging,
abandonment and decommissioning up to an aggregate maximum amount of Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) per Well so retained by Seller. 

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that no bonds, letters of credit, guarantee
or other security provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to
the Assets shall remain in place for the benefit of Purchaser.

 

7.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, prior to Closing, Purchaser may offer employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates to any Business Employee identified by Purchaser in its sole
discretion on terms and conditions determined by Purchaser in its sole
discretion. Within five (5) Business Days following request from Purchaser,
Seller shall post (or send via electronic mail) a written advertisement
(electronically or otherwise) prepared by Purchaser notifying Sellers
Business Employees of the positions Purchaser has open for hire and including
information on how such Business Employees may apply for such positions.
Purchaser is solely responsible for scheduling any meetings or interviews with
any Business Employees interested in employment with Purchaser. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that Purchaser or its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to interview or make an offer of employment to any of the Business
Employees (including any Business Employee who is not actively at work)
pursuant to this Agreement or for any other reason. Each Business Employee
who accepts an offer of employment with Purchaser and commences employment
with Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof immediately following the Closing or,
if applicable, the end of the transition period under the Transition Services
Agreement (such applicable date, the " _Transfer Date_ ") is referred to
herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." Seller shall be responsible for any
severance payable to any Business Employee that is triggered under any
employee benefit plan.

(b) Subject to Purchasers rights under Section 11.1(b)(iv), Purchaser
hereby releases Seller Group from any claims for Losses relating to
Purchasers hiring of Business Employees (including Purchasers use of
Business Employees in making the decision to hire or not to hire).

(c) Seller shall remain obligated to provide continuation health care
coverage (including the issuance of any required notices), in accordance with
Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 to 608 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ "), to
each Business Employee and his or her qualified dependents and each
other individual who, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, meet the definition of a "MandA qualified beneficiary" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4. Purchaser shall
have responsibility for any and all obligations under COBRA with respect to
Transferred Employees and their qualified dependents who incur qualifying
events, in each case, on or after the Transfer Date.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are solely for the benefit of the
respective Parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 7.7, express
or implied, shall confer upon any other Person, including any employee (or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof), any Third Party beneficiary rights or
other rights or remedies, including any right to continuance of employment or
any other service relationship with Purchaser, Seller or any of their
Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits or any term of condition
of employment or service of any nature or kind

 



55

    

 whatsoever under this Agreement or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 7.7,
__ express or implied, shall: (i) interfere with the right of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship
of any Transferred Employee at any time, (ii) obligate Purchaser or its
Affiliates to adopt, enter into or maintain any benefit or compensation plan,
program or arrangement at any time, (iii) be construed as the establishment
of or an amendment to any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement, arrangement or contract, or (iv) limit the ability of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or contract.

 

7.8 _Recording_ __ _ and Filing_. Within thirty (30) days of Closing,
Purchaser shall, at its expense, file or record the conveyance documents with
the appropriate governmental agencies or records office. Purchaser shall
provide a copy of same, including recording date, to the Seller and any other
contract parties requiring the same. If any governmental agency or records
office rejects the filing or recording of any Assignment or Deed due to lack
of information therein, then Seller shall promptly provide such missing
information to Purchaser.

7.9 _Notice to Third Parties_. Seller shall prepare prior to Closing, and
Purchaser and Seller shall execute at Closing, all transfer orders, division
orders, or letters-in-lieu necessary to transfer payment of the proceeds
from the sale of production from the Assets as of the Effective Date to
Purchaser, and joinders, ratifications or other similar instruments required
to transfer Assets as of the Effective Date to the Purchaser.

 

7.10 _Property Records_. Promptly after the Closing Date (but in any event
within twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date), Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser electronic copies of the Basic Documents and Records
(subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement) which were not
already delivered by Seller. Any electronic information or data provided
shall be in the same format as that then currently used by Seller and Seller
is not required to perform or create additional programming or system support
in connection therewith. Seller may retain photocopies, electronic images or
other formats of the Basic Documents and Records. Seller may excise or redact
Records to remove information that would constitute an Excluded Record. Seller
and Purchaser shall each appoint one (1) __ focal point for coordination of
the transfer of electronic information and data to Purchaser. Promptly after
Closing, Seller shall make available to Purchaser originals (or, if neither
Seller nor its Affiliates possess originals, copies to the extent in Sellers
possession) of the Basic Documents and Records at Sellers offices during
normal business hours.

 

7.11 _Use of Name_. On or before ninety (90) days after Closing (or
earlier to the extent required by Laws), Purchaser will remove, or cause to
be removed, from the facilities pertaining to the Assets, the name, logo and
service mark of Seller and its Affiliates, and all variations and derivations
thereof, and will not thereafter make use thereof.

7.12 _Seller_ __ _s Insurance_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that (a) no insurance policies arranged for the benefit of or provided to the
Seller or any member of the Seller Group, including any current insurance
policies relating to the business or assets of the Seller shall continue
after Closing, except to the extent required under the Transition Services
Agreement, (b) __ Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that no member of
the Purchaser shall, make any claims under any such insurance policies or
insurance coverage in respect of facts, events or circumstances arising prior
to the Closing and (c) __ following Closing, to the extent recoverable under
Sellers insurance, upon 

 



56

    

 Purchasers request, Seller shall file (and seek to recover) under its
insurance any claims arising out of or resulting from any of the Assumed
Obligations with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date and upon
receipt, pay to Purchaser any net proceeds received from such insurance
provider.

 

7.13 _Transition Services_. At Closing, the Parties shall enter into a
mutually agreeable transition services agreement (the "Transition Services
Agreement") pursuant to which Seller will provide gas sales accounting
services, information technology services (including the transfer to Purchaser
of any FCC licenses) and such other transition services as may be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties for a period not to exceed six (6) months following
Closing. Seller shall provide such services to Purchaser pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement for a period of two (2) months following
Closing with no fee for such services charged or chargeable to Purchaser,
_provided_ that Seller may charge a fee of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($350,000) per month (subject to proportionate reduction to the
extent of any reduced services) for its provision of services under the
Transition Services Agreement from and after such initial two (2)-month period
until the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement. Prior to Closing,
the Parties shall reasonably and in good faith negotiate the form of
Transition Services Agreement.

 

7.14 _Data Privacy_.

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges that it may be required to process Personal
Data during the undertaking of its obligations under this Agreement. Each
Party agrees that it shall comply with the obligations imposed on it by all
applicable Data Protection Laws with respect thereto and use commercially
reasonable efforts to take commercially reasonable technical and
organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized or unlawful
processing of, accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to Personal Data.

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Personal Data made
available to any Party or their representatives hereunder shall be made
available on an "as is" basis without any warranties, either express or
implied, as to the quality, completeness, accuracy, validity, non-infringement
or utility of such Personal Data. In no event shall the Party providing
Personal Data be liable for any actual, incidental, punitive, consequential or
other damages arising out of, or resulting from the receiving Partys or
their representatives (i) use of or reliance upon the Personal Data or (ii)
disclosure of the Personal Data to a Third Party in breach of this Agreement
or any applicable Data Protection Law. The Parties agree that the Party
responsible for a breach of data privacy or a violation of relevant
applicable Data Protection Laws will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
non-breaching Party from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
causes of actions, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, those
involving theories of negligence or strict liability and including court costs
and attorneys fees) asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon or
incurred by the non-breaching Party as a result of, or arising out of the
breach of data privacy or a violation of relevant applicable Data Protection
Laws.

 

7.15 _Environmental Reporting_. For any reporting to a Governmental
Authority related to the Assets that because of the Closing Date and
particular Law could involve the potential for combined or split reporting,
Purchaser and Seller shall confer at an agreed time prior to Closing in order
to resolve any issues related to such reporting.

7.16 _Amendment of Schedules_. Each Party agrees that, with respect to
the representations and warranties of such Party contained in this Agreement,
such Party shall have the

 



57

    

 continuing right until Closing to add, supplement or amend the Schedules to
its representations and warranties to include any matter arising or occurring
after the Execution Date, which, if existing as of the Execution Date, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedule. For all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of indemnification pursuant
to Article 11 and for determining whether the conditions set forth in Section
5.1 have been satisfied, the Schedules to Sellers representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the date of execution of this Agreement and
shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any addition,
supplement or amendment thereto; _provided, however_ , that if (i) any matters
disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment
would constitute a breach of any of the representations and warranties of
Seller set forth in Section 6.1 and Purchaser would have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.2(c) as a result of such
breach, and (ii) Purchaser nevertheless elects to proceed with Closing
notwithstanding (and with knowledge of) such breach, then the matters
disclosed pursuant to such addition, supplement or amendment shall be waived,
and Purchaser shall not be entitled to make a claim with respect thereto
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

 

7.17 _Gas Sales Contracts and Gas Gathering Agreement_.

 

(a) At Closing, Purchaser shall, and Seller shall cause Shell Energy North
America (US), L.P. (" _SENA_ ") to enter into new transaction confirmations
substantially similar to the forms attached hereto as Exhibit H to replace the
Gas Sales Confirmations.

 

(b) The NAESB Contract (and the corresponding Gas Sales Confirmations)
shall be retained by Seller and deemed an Excluded Asset, and Purchaser shall
have no further liability or obligation to Seller with respect thereto.

 

(c) After the Execution Date, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into a gas gathering agreement with Delmar Midstream LLC to
be entered into effective as of the Closing Date. If such gas gathering
agreement is executed on or before Closing, then the Specified Delmar
Contracts shall be assigned to Purchaser at Closing pursuant to the
applicable Assignment and shall no longer constitute Excluded Assets. In the
event the foregoing agreement is not executed on or before the Closing Date,
Purchaser and Seller shall enter into a gas gathering agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I in order to facilitate Sellers performance
of the Delmar Contracts.

 

7.18 _Financing Statements and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Seller acknowledges that Purchaser or its Affiliates may be required to
include certain audited and unaudited financial information relating to the
Assets in documents filed by Purchaser or its Affiliates or assignee with the
SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and Exchange Act, or in other materials
(including offering materials for securities offered and sold as eligible for
resale under Rule 144A of the Securities Act), and that such financial
statements may be required to be independently audited (together with any
supplementary oil and gas information required by ASC 932-235, the "Requisite
Financial Statement Information"). At Purchasers request, from and after the
Execution Date and for up to three months after Closing, Seller shall, at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, and only to the extent Purchaser does not
already have the necessary information: (i) provide reasonable assistance to
Purchaser in response to due diligence requests of potential financing sources
of Purchaser and its Affiliates, including attending, and causing employees
of Seller and its Affiliates familiar with the Assets to attend, due diligence
meetings (which may be by teleconference) during normal business hours,
responding to reasonable due diligence inquiries by potential financing
sources of Purchaser and its Affiliates and assisting in the provision of
financial data and other records of the Assets for the preparation of pro
forma financial statements of the Purchaser and (ii) provide Purchaser (or its
applicable Affiliate or assignee) and its auditors reasonable access during
normal business hours to such records (to the extent that such information is
available) and personnel of Seller and its Affiliates and use reasonable
efforts to, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, provide reasonable access
during normal business hours to Sellers and its Affiliates accounting firm,
in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), as Purchaser (or its
applicable Affiliate or assignee) may reasonably request to enable Purchaser
(or its applicable Affiliate or assignee) and its auditor, and its
representatives, for the sole purpose of creating and, to the extent required
by Law, auditing, the Requisite Financial Statement Information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.18, Seller shall
not be required to (and shall not be in breach of this Section 7.18 for
failure to) create any new records relating to the Assets or financial
statements or undertake an audit of any existing records on behalf of
Purchaser or otherwise.

 



58

    

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand Sellers
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates or any third party any rights to
which it is not entitled hereunder. Purchaser hereby releases the
Seller Group from, and shall fully protect, defend, indemnify and hold the
Seller Group harmless from and against, in each case, any and all Losses
(including costs of investigation and attorneys and experts fees and
expenses) relating to, arising out of or connected with, directly or
indirectly, any actions, representations or certifications of Sellers and
their Affiliates personnel or auditors with respect to the Requisite
Financial Information and the access, records and cooperation provided
pursuant to this Section 7.18, or Purchasers use of the Requisite Financial
Information and any other information contained in such records, or the
inclusion of such financial records in any debt or equity offering documents
or related materials. THESE INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OR ARISE OUT OF, SOLELY OR IN PART,
THE SOLE, ACTIVE, GROSS, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY MEMBER OF
THE SELLER GROUP; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE
OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
MEMBER OF THE SELLER GROUP. Purchaser will reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates, within ten Business Days after demand in writing therefor, for any
reasonable, documented, third-party out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller and
its Affiliates at the written request of Purchaser in complying with the
provisions of this Section 7.18

7.19 _Confidentiality_. The Parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect at and after the
Closing, except with respect to (a) any of Sellers or its Affiliates
confidential or proprietary records and information disclosed to Purchaser or
its Affiliates pursuant to Section 7.18 or to Purchaser pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement (but not conveyed to Purchaser hereunder), including
bids received from and records of negotiations with third Persons,
records containing Sellers or its Affiliates economic, reserves or
investment forecasts, analysis, criteria, or rationales or similar
information, but excluding in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, reserve,
production and financial information pertaining to the Assets or the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Assets acquired or to be acquired
hereunder, and (b) any documents and instruments of Seller and its Affiliates
that may be protected by attorney-client privilege (clauses (a) and (b) the
"Excepted Confidential Information"). If the Closing occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in effect with respect to the
Excepted Confidential Information for a period of three (3) years thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
Purchaser and any of its Affiliates may, without prior consent of Seller (but,
in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) of this sentence, with respect to
the Requisite Financial Statement Information, after consultation with Seller
beginning at least 24 hours in advance of disclosure), disclose the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and any information regarding this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
Assets and any related financial, reserve, production and other information or
such other information deemed necessary by Purchaser or its Affiliates) in or
in connection with (i) offering materials for an offering of securities or
other financing transaction of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
pursuant to applicable Laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and/or (iii) one or more customary investor presentations or related
conference calls by Purchaser or its Affiliates with investors or analysts.

ARTICLE 8

 

ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE and EXPENSES; ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE

 

8.1 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Except as specifically provided for in the next succeeding paragraph,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all Hydrocarbon production
revenue and Property Expenses produced from or attributable to any part of the
Assets and relating to the period prior to the Effective Date shall be owned
by and borne by Seller (" _Seller Amounts_ ") and all similar Hydrocarbon
production revenue and Property Expenses, produced from or attributable to the
Assets and relating to the period after the Effective Date, shall be owned by
and borne by Purchaser (" _Purchaser Amounts_ "). Seller shall gauge all
merchantable Hydrocarbon and non-Hydrocarbon

 



59

    

 substances associated with the Mineral Interests in storage as of the
Effective Date, and in accordance with the foregoing, Seller shall be entitled
to the proceeds of the same when sold. Substances in treating and separation
equipment below pipeline connections as of the Effective Date shall not be
considered merchantable and shall become the property of the Purchaser.

 

(b) In accordance with Section 8.1(a), the Unadjusted Purchase Price will
be increased by the following amounts (without duplication):

(i) the amount of any Property Expenses that are paid by Seller (and not
reimbursed by Purchaser) at any time and attributable to the Properties for
the period of time on or after the Effective Date;

 

(ii) the amount of Asset Taxes allocated to Purchaser pursuant to Section
9.1(a) but paid or otherwise economically borne by Seller;

(iii) the value of the following items, less any applicable Asset Taxes,
Burdens and other similar burdens paid by Purchaser:

(A) the amount of all proceeds, receipts (including producing receipts and
drilling receipts), reimbursements, credits, and income paid to or received by
Purchaser, including proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons, that are
attributable to the Properties for the period of time prior to the Effective
Date; and

(B) the amount equal to the value of all of Sellers inventories of
Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties that are in
storage above the load line or pipeline connection, as applicable, as of the
Effective Date (which value shall be computed using the applicable contract
price at the Effective Date); _provided, however_ , that the adjustment
contemplated by this paragraph shall only be made to the extent that Seller
does not receive and retain proceeds attributable to the sale of any such
Hydrocarbons; 

(iv) all Imbalances owed to Seller by a Third Party as set forth on
Schedule 6.1(n);

 

(v) the amount of all other upward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price provided for in this Agreement or otherwise agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser in writing.

(c) In accordance with Section 8.1(a), the Unadjusted Purchase Price will
be decreased by the following amounts (without duplication):

 

(i) the amount of any Property Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing
Date and attributable to the Properties for the period of time prior to the
Effective Date;

(ii) the amount of all proceeds, receipts (including producing receipts
and drilling receipts), reimbursements, credits, and income paid to or
received by Seller, including proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons, net of
all applicable Asset Taxes, Burdens and other similar burdens paid by Seller,
that are attributable to the Properties for the period of time on or after the
Effective Date;

 



60

    

(iii) with respect to Assets excluded from the transaction due to un-
obtained consent requirements or preferential purchase rights pursuant to
Section 4.2, the Allocated Value for each such Asset so excluded;

 

(iv) the amount of any Suspense Funds held by Seller and owed to Third
Parties for which Purchaser will assume responsibility;

(v) all Imbalances owed by Seller to a Third Party as set forth
on Schedule 6.1(n); and

(vi) the amount of all other downward adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price provided for in this Agreement or otherwise agreed upon by
Seller and Purchaser in writing.

 

(d) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall
furnish Purchaser with (i) a good faith estimated accounting (" _Preliminary
Accounting_ "), determined on an accrual basis in conjunction with this
Section 8.1, prepared in a manner consistent with Sellers past accounting
practices, showing Sellers estimate of each adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (including the Seller Amounts and Purchaser Amounts) through
the Closing Date including the calculations thereof and (ii) to the extent
reasonably available to Seller, the data and documentation supporting the
calculations set forth in the Preliminary Accounting. Purchaser will have
three (3) days after receipt of the Preliminary Accounting to review such
statement and to object to any item therein by written notice to Seller.
Purchasers notice will clearly identify any item(s) objected to and the
reasons and support for the objection(s). The Parties shall attempt to agree
on the amount of the adjustments to be included in the Preliminary Accounting
no later than one (1) Business Day prior to Closing. If the Parties do not
agree by that date, Sellers good faith estimates shall be used to determine
the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price. If Purchaser does
not provide written objection(s) within the three (3) day period, the Parties
will treat the Preliminary Accounting as correct and agreed for purposes of
determining the adjustments to be made at Closing to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price. The Preliminary Accounting is subject to final adjustment as provided
in Section 8.2.

 

8.2 _Final Accounting._

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to accomplish a
single final accounting and cash adjustment for the period between the
Effective Date and the Closing no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after Closing to determine the amounts of adjustments to be made to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price (" _Final Accounting_ "). Parties shall cooperate
to avoid split month accounting for revenue. To that end, in the event Closing
does not occur on the first (1st) day of a calendar month, Seller will market
Hydrocarbon production, pay associated Burdens for the calendar month in
which Closing occurs on Purchasers behalf, and Sellers remittance of the
amount of production sales, less Burdens, paid by Seller to Purchaser will be
included in the Final Accounting adjustments (but only to the extent not
already accounted for in the adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price made
at Closing and set forth in the Preliminary Accounting). Seller shall prepare
the Final Accounting and submit it to Purchaser for acceptance. To the extent
reasonably required by Seller, Purchaser shall assist in the preparation of
the Final Accounting. Purchaser shall have the right to audit the Final
Accounting. The Parties failure to complete the Final Accounting shall
not constitute a waiver of the right to receive any amount

 



61

    

 otherwise due. The Final Accounting shall become final and binding upon the
Parties and payable thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by Purchaser (the "
_Final Accounting Date_ ") unless Purchaser gives written notice of its
disagreement (an " _Accounting Notice_ ") to Seller prior to the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period. Time is of the essence with respect to the
Accounting Notice. Any Accounting Notice shall specify the dollar amount,
nature and basis of the disagreement so asserted. Purchaser shall not be
entitled to dispute any expenditure made by Seller in accordance with Sellers
past and bona fide practices, but only to the extent any such expenditure is
not made in violation of Section 7.3. If an Accounting Notice is received by
Seller in a timely manner, then the Final Accounting (as revised in accordance
with clause (i) or (ii) below) shall become final and binding on the Parties
and any amounts due shall be payable by the earlier of thirty (30) days after
(i) the date Seller and Purchaser agree in writing with respect to all matters
as to which there is a disagreement or (ii) the date on which the Accounting
Referee issues its decision.

(b) During the thirty (30) day period following the date of receipt by
Seller of an Accounting Notice, Seller shall make available the records
relevant to the disagreement and Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect
to all matters specified in the Accounting Notice. If, at the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Seller and Purchaser have not reached agreement on
such matters, the matters that remain in dispute shall be submitted to a
mutually agreed neutral accountant (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for review
and final binding resolution. The Accounting Referee shall be a certified
public accountant who is an employee or partner of a recognized independent
public accounting firm. In the event the Parties cannot agree upon the
Accounting Referee, each Party will appoint a neutral accountant who meets the
criteria set forth in the foregoing sentence and the two (2) selected
accountants shall appoint a third accountant meeting the foregoing criteria
to be the "Accounting Referee." All determinations and adjustments with
respect to allocating items to the period before or after the Effective Date
shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently applied, and this Agreement. The Accounting Referee shall render
a decision resolving the matters in dispute within fifteen (15) days following
their submission to the Accounting Referee. Seller and Purchaser shall each
be responsible for one-half (1/2) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Referee. In the event the disagreement relates to a contract interpretation
matter as opposed to an accounting matter, such matter shall be resolved
pursuant to the provisions of Article 16 and not this Article 8.

 

(c) If, prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, a Party
receives any revenues, proceeds or invoice for any additional expenses for or
on behalf of the other Party, it shall promptly remit to the other Party the
revenues or proceeds received (to the extent such amounts had not been
previously accounted for in the Final Accounting) or transmit such invoice to
the other Party (who shall timely pay such invoice). No claim made pursuant to
this Section 8.2(c) shall be valid unless it is brought prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

8.3 _Notice to Remitters of Proceeds._

 

After the Closing, the Parties shall inform the remitters of any revenues or
proceeds attributable to the Assets to pay Purchaser to the extent practical
after the Effective Date. To the extent that any remitter pays revenues or
proceeds to the incorrect Party, that Party shall promptly remit such revenues
or proceeds (without interest) to the correct Party.

 



62

    

8.4 _Accounting Standards._

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
amount of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this
Article 8 shall be determined in accordance with accrual basis of accounting
under the accounting standards of GAAP.

 

ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS 

9.1 _Apportionment of Taxes_.

 

(a) All Taxes (except Transfer Taxes allocated pursuant to Section 9.2 and
federal, state, or local income taxes, gross margin taxes, franchise taxes or
gross receipts taxes) attributable to the acquisition, operation, or ownership
of the Assets or Hydrocarbon production from the Assets and similar
obligations (" _Asset Taxes_ ") are Sellers responsibility where
attributable to the period prior to the Effective Date and Purchasers
responsibility where attributable to the period after the Effective Date (in
each case, regardless of when assessed on the Assets or Hydrocarbon
production). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Pennsylvania
Impact Fee, Seller is responsible for such impact fees assessed on the Assets
for calendar years up to and including calendar year 2019 and Purchaser is
responsible for such impact fees assessed on the Assets from calendar year
2020 and subsequent calendar years thereafter.

 

(b) To the extent possible, amounts relating to such Taxes shall be
included in the Final Accounting, but the Final Accounting shall not
constitute a final settlement of Tax liability as allocated between the
Parties pursuant to this Section 9.1. To the extent the actual amount of an
Asset Tax is not known at the time of the Final Accounting, the Parties shall
utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount of such
Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of
any Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or otherwise economically borne by
a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any)
that was taken into account in the Final Accounting, timely payments will be
made from one Party to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party
to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under
this Section 9.1.

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations in Section 9.1(a), (i)
Asset Taxes attributable to Hydrocarbon severance or production (other than
Asset Taxes described in clause (iii)) shall be apportioned based on whether
the severance or production occurs before or after the Effective Date, (ii)
Asset Taxes that are based on or related to sales or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) or
(iii)) shall be apportioned based on whether the transactions giving rise to
such Asset Taxes occur before or after the Effective Date, and (iii) Asset
Taxes that are ad valorem, property, and similar taxes imposed on a periodic
basis shall be apportioned based on the percentage of the assessment period
before and after the Effective Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
any exemption, deduction, credit, or other item that is calculated on a
periodic basis shall be allocated pro rata per day between the portion of the
assessment period ending before the Effective Date and the portion of the
assessment period beginning after the Effective Date. Each Party shall be
responsible for its own federal, state, or local income taxes, gross margin
taxes, franchise taxes or gross receipts taxes.

 



63

    

9.2 _Transfer Taxes and Other Fees_.

Purchaser shall be responsible for paying all sales, use, excise, stock,
stamp, documentary, filing, recording, permit transfer, registration,
authorization, realty transfer taxes and similar taxes, fees and charges ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, that are payable upon or because of the transfer
of any of the Assets to Purchaser. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in
good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible by Law, the amount of any
Transfer Taxes.

 

9.3 _Tax Reporting of the Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate the Unadjusted Purchase Price
and any liabilities assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement such that no
more than forty-six percent (46%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
allocated to tangible property and no less than fifty-four percent (54%) shall
be allocated to the Mineral Interests. Seller and Purchaser each agree that
the Assets subject to this Agreement do not constitute an "applicable asset
acquisition" as described under Code Section 1060, and do not constitute a
trade or business in the ordinary sense of the term. Seller and Purchaser
each agree to report the Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated
herein, and in particular to report the information consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith upon
examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation,
investigation or otherwise unless required to do so by applicable Law after
notice to the other Party, or with such other Partys prior consent;
_provided, however_ , no Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability
and discretion to negotiate, compromise, compromise, or settle any Tax audit,
claim, or similar proceeding in connection with the Tax consequences of the
transaction contemplated herein.

9.4 _Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings_.

Purchaser and Seller will cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of any Tax
Returns with respect to the Assets and any audit, litigation or other
proceedings.

liability for all plugging, abandonment and restoration obligations with
respect to the Assets, regardless of whether such obligations relate or are
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Properties prior to or after
the Effective Date, and including, but not limited to, the obligation to:

 

(i) plug and abandon (or re-plug) any and all oil, gas or condensate wells
and wellbore(s) (whether producing, not producing or abandoned or plugged
prior

 



65

    

 to or after the Effective Date), water source, water injection and other

on or comprising Assets; 

(iii) restore each Mineral Interest and wellsite(s) associated with the Oil
and Gas Interests, including the surface and subsurface;

(iv) cleanup and dispose of any equipment or materials contaminated with

(v) perform all other obligations related to the foregoing that arise by
contract, lease terms, applicable Law or demands of governmental agencies;

all to be performed in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with

or connected with, the environmental condition of the Assets ("

out of the following circumstances, conditions, occurrences, events and
activities on or related to the Assets, regardless of whether occurring, or
arising or resulting from any acts or omissions of Seller or any other Person
prior to or after the Effective Date or the condition of the Assets when

(c) _EXTENT OF INDEMNIFICATION_. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE SCOPE
OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, DEFENSE AND ASSUMPTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AN INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL
BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF
SECTIONS 11.1(a) OR 11.1(b), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ACT, OCCURRENCE OR
CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO ANY SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT
OF THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY ANY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON, PROVIDED THAT NO
SUCH INDEMNIFICATION SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT OF ANY FRAUD,
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
liability of Seller and Purchaser under this Agreement and any documents
delivered in connection herewith or contemplated hereby shall be limited as
follows:

 



68

    

(i) Except for the Fundamental Representations, which survive
indefinitely, and the representations in Section 6.1(h), which survive thirty
(30) days after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the
representations and warranties of the Parties and NFGC set forth in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12)
months and all representations and warranties of the Parties under this
Agreement shall terminate twelve (12) months after the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that any such representation or warranty for which a
written notice of claim specifying in reasonable detail the specific nature of
the Losses and the estimated amount of such Losses (" _Claim Notice_ ")
delivered in good faith in compliance with the requirements of this Section
11.1(d) shall survive with respect only to the specific matter described in
such Claim Notice until the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which a
final non-appealable resolution of the matter described in such Claim Notice
has been reached or (B) the date on which the matter described in such Claim
Notice has otherwise reached final resolution. The indemnities in Section
11.1(b)(iv) (except those indemnities for the matters described in clauses
(i), (ii), (vii), (ix) or (xi) of the definition of "Retained Obligations")
shall survive the Closing Date for a period of four (4) years. The
indemnities in Section 11.1(b)(iv) for the matters described in clauses (i),
(ii), (vii), (ix) or (xi) in the definition of "Retained Obligations" shall
survive the Closing Date indefinitely.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall:

 

A. SELLER OR PURCHASER BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (EXCEPT WHERE SUCH DAMAGES CONSTITUTE PART
OF A CLAIM OF A THIRD PARTY WHICH IS INDEMNIFIED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT);

 

B. Seller indemnify Purchaser, or be otherwise liable to Purchaser, for any
Losses arising from a breach of a representation or warranty of Seller that
is not a Fundamental Representation or the representations and warranties
contained in Section __ 6.1(h)(i)-(vi) (A) for any individual claim for Loss
that does not exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the "
_Individual Threshold_ "), and (B) __ until Purchaser has suffered Losses (in
excess of the Individual Threshold) in the aggregate in excess of the
Aggregate Indemnity Deductible, after which point Seller will be obligated
only to indemnify Purchaser from and against further Losses in excess of the
Individual Threshold and in excess of the Aggregate Indemnity Deductible; and

 

C. Seller indemnify Purchaser under (A) Sections 11.1(b)(i) with respect to
Sellers non-Fundamental Representations (excluding the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 6.1(h)(i)-(vi)) in excess of ten percent
(10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price or (B) Section 11.1(b)(i) with respect
to Sellers Fundamental Representations, the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 6.1(h)(i)-(vi) and Sections 11.1(b)(ii)-(vi) in excess
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

(i) The amount of any indemnification provided under Section 11.1(a) or (b)
shall be net of any amounts of insurance proceeds or other amounts from any
Third Party actually recovered or realized by the Indemnified Party in respect
of the indemnification claim to which such insurance proceeds or other amounts
relate.

 



69

    

(ii) Notwithstanding anything stated herein to the contrary, neither Party
will have any liability to the other Party or such other Partys indemnified
parties under this Section 11 with respect to any item for which a specific
adjustment has already been made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under the
terms of this Agreement.

(iii) Each person entitled to indemnification hereunder or otherwise to
damages in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate all losses, costs, expenses and
damages after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any losses, costs, expenses and damages that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 

(e) All claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted
and resolved pursuant to this Section 11.1(e). Any Person claiming
indemnification hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnified
Party" and any Person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is
hereinafter referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." In the event that any
Losses are asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified
Party by a Third Party, said Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The Indemnifying
Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect
to any such Losses if the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
in reasonably sufficient time so that the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the Losses is not materially prejudiced. The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days from the personal delivery or receipt of the Claim
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether
or not it disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or (ii) whether or not
it desires, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend
the Indemnified Party against such Losses; _provided, however_ , that any
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period
to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party (and
of which it shall have given notice and opportunity to comment to the
Indemnifying Party). In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Losses, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend all appropriate proceedings with counsel of its own choosing,
which proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted by them to a final
conclusion. If the Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not
control, any such defense or settlement it may do so at its sole cost and
expense. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees
to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any
Losses that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest; _provided, however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to bring, or cooperate with,
any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Losses or any
cross-complaint against any Person. No claim may be settled or otherwise
compromised without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and
no claim may be settled or compromised by the Indemnifying Party without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless such settlement or compromise entails a full and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party without any admission or
finding of fault or liability.

 

(f) Any payments made to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
11.1 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
the Assets for federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



70

    

11.2 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

If Closing occurs, except with respect to the special warranty of title
contained in the Assignments and the Deed, the indemnities set forth in this
Agreement and the remedies expressly provided for herein shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the parties indemnified hereunder for breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement;  _provided,
however_ , nothing in this Section 11.2 shall be deemed to affect any Persons
right to equitable relief (including specific performance in a court of law)
for breach of a covenant set forth in this Agreement (whether or not such
covenant is set forth in Article 7). Except for such remedies, Purchaser
releases and forever discharges Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, managers, members, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from any and all Losses whatsoever, in law or in equity,
known or unknown, which such parties might now or subsequently may have, based
on, relating to or arising from this Agreement, Sellers ownership, use or
operation of the Properties, or the condition, quality, status or nature of
the Properties, including rights to contribution under CERCLA or any other
Environmental Law, breaches of statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or
other tort actions, rights to punitive damages and common law rights of
contribution, rights under agreements between Seller or any of its Affiliates,
and rights under insurance maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates, EVEN
IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT
OR CONCURRENT, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), OF
ANY RELEASED PERSON.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after Closing, each
of Seneca and NFG Midstream shall be severally, and not jointly, liable with
respect to each representation, warranty, indemnification obligation with
respect thereto and Assumed Obligation contained herein, such that (a) NFG
Midstream shall be severally liable for (i) the representations and warranties
made by NFG Midstream, (ii) the covenants of Purchaser and Assumed Obligations
related to the Midstream Assets, and (iii) the indemnification obligations of
Purchaser with respect to such matters, and (b) Seneca shall be severally
liable for (i) the representations and warranties made by Seneca, (ii) the
covenants of Purchaser and Assumed Obligations related to the Assets (other
than the Midstream Assets), and (iii) the indemnification obligations of
Purchaser with respect to such matters; _provided, however_ , that where
Purchaser has a right or obligation (other than an indemnity obligation)
under this Agreement, each of Seneca and NFG Midstream shall exercise such
right or discharge such obligation acting jointly.

 

11.3 _Midstream Parent Guarantee_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any limitations on
Purchasers liability described in Article 11), from and after the Closing
Date, Midstream Parent shall absolutely and unconditionally guarantee any and
all indemnification obligations of NFG Midstream arising under this Agreement
(the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), such that if NFG Midstream defaults in the
full or partial performance of any Guaranteed Obligation, Midstream Parent
shall perform or cause to be performed such Guaranteed Obligations promptly
following written notice of such NFG Midstream default. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Midstream Parent reserves unto itself the right to assert any and
all claims, counterclaims, defenses, setoffs, and other rights that NFG
Midstream is entitled to

 



71

    

 assert on its own account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligations.

 

ARTICLE 12

CASUALTY LOSS

12.1 _Casualty Loss prior to Closing_

 

(i) If, between the Execution Date and the Closing, any substantial portion
of the Assets are materially damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty
(not including normal wear and tear, downhole mechanical failure or reservoir
changes) or if any substantial portion of the Assets are taken by condemnation
or under the right of eminent domain (all of which are herein called _"_
_Casualty_ ___Loss_ _"_ and are limited to property damage or taking only),
Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller learns of such event.
Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure a Casualty Loss
that consists of property damage by repairing the affected Asset to the state
existing immediately preceding such Casualty Loss no later than the Closing
Date.

 

(ii) If any uncured Casualty Loss exists at the Closing, and the loss as a
result of such Casualty Loss exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000), the Asset affected by such Casualty Loss shall be conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing and Seller shall elect by written notice to Purchaser
prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Unadjusted Purchase Price to be
reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the loss resulting from such Casualty
Loss, (ii) pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason
of the damage or taking of such Asset, and to the extent Seller is not
contractually prohibited from doing so, Seller shall assign, transfer and set
over unto Purchaser all of the right, title and interest of Seller in and to
any insurance, claims, unpaid proceeds or other payments or rights to receive
payments from Third Parties arising out of such damage or taking or (iii)
cure the Casualty Loss. EACH SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF INSURANCE COVERING CASUALTY LOSS TO THE ASSETS, AND
DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION, COVENANT OR DUTY TO PURCHASER TO ASSERT OR PURSUE
ANY CLAIM AGAINST ANY INSURER OR OTHER PERSON FOR CASUALTY LOSS TO THE ASSETS.

 

12.2 _Limitation_. Subject to Section __5.1.1(d) and Section __12.1(ii)
and notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser __ s recourse with respect to any Casualty Loss shall be limited to
an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section
12.1(i), a cure by Seller as set forth in Section __12.1(ii), or the proceeds
of Seller __ s casualty insurance coverage actually recovered by Seller in
respect thereof or other sums paid to Seller by Third Parties (or an
assignment of claims related thereto), payable to Purchaser only upon or
after the Closing of the transactions contemplated herein. Seller shall have
no other liability or responsibility to Purchaser with respect to a Casualty
Loss, even if such Casualty Loss shall have resulted from or

 



72

    

 shall have arisen out of the sole or concurrent negligence, fault, or breach
of statute (but excluding gross negligence or willful misconduct) of Seller or
any member of Seller Group.

 

ARTICLE 13

TERMINATION 

13.1 _Termination_.

 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time after the later of (i) __August
__31, 2020 and (ii) __if the Parties pursue expedited arbitration in
accordance with Section __5.1.1(d) and 5.1.2(d), five (5) Business Days
following the arbitrator s final decision pursuant to such expedited
arbitration (the " _Outside Date_ "), by Seller or Purchaser by written
notice to the other Party if the Closing has not occurred on or before such
date. This Agreement may otherwise be terminated at any time after the
Execution Date and before the Closing Date only:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

(b) by Seller, or by Purchaser, by written notice to the other Party, if a
Governmental Authority shall have issued an injunction, order or award or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such injunction, order, award or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable;

(c) by Purchaser if there has been a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement by Seller that (i) has resulted in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1.1, (ii) has not been waived by Purchaser,
and (iii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or is not
cured by the earlier of (A) ten (10) days following Purchasers written notice
to Seller of such breach and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.1(c) shall not be available
to Purchaser if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

(d) by Seller if there has been a material breach of any of
the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement by Purchaser that (i) has resulted in the failure to satisfy any of
the conditions set forth in Section 5.1.2, (ii) has not been waived by Seller,
and (iii) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or is not
cured by the earlier of (A) ten (10) days following Sellers written notice to
Purchaser of such breach and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.1(d) shall not be available
to Seller if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other agreement contained herein; or

 

(e) by either Seller or Purchaser if, under the HSR Act or otherwise, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the U.S. Department of Justice ("
_DOJ_ ") shall have commenced or threatened to commence any proceeding to
delay or enjoin or seek damages in respect of the transactions evidenced by
this Agreement ("threatened," for purposes of this Section 13.1(e), means an
actual vote of the Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission to commence
such a proceeding). For purposes of clarity, issuance of a second request by
either the FTC or the DOJ shall

 



73

    

 not constitute a proceeding to delay or enjoin or seek damages in respect of
the transactions evidenced by this Agreement.

 

13.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.1, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect (except for
the provisions of Article 1, Section 7.4, Article 13, Article 14 and all other
waivers, disclaimers and releases that are in bold and/or that are capitalized
in this Agreement, Section 15.1, Section 15.2, Section 15.5, Section 15.6,
Section 15.8, Section 15.9, Section 15.10 and its subsections, Section 15.11,
Section 15.15, Section 15.16, Article 16, and the Confidentiality Agreement).

 

(b) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(d), Seller
shall be entitled to receive the Performance Deposit as liquidated damages in
lieu of all other damages and as the Sellers sole and exclusive remedy in
such event, other than termination of this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that if Seller is entitled to receive the Performance
Deposit pursuant to this Section 13.2(b), then (i) Sellers actual damages are
difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (ii) the Performance Deposit is a
fair and reasonable estimate by the Parties of such actual damages of Seller
and (iii) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

 

(c) (i) If Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(c),
then Seller shall return the Performance Deposit to Purchaser within ten (10)
Business Days after the determination that the Closing will not occur and
Purchaser shall retain any legal or equitable remedies for Sellers breach of
this Agreement subject to the limitations set forth below; _provided,
however_ , that Seller shall not have any liability to Purchaser for monetary
damages in excess of an amount equal to the Performance Deposit; and (ii) if
Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
13.1(c), then, in lieu of termination, Purchaser may seek specific performance
to enforce Sellers compliance with this Agreement and during such time that
Purchaser is seeking specific performance in lieu of termination, Seller
shall not be obligated to return the Performance Deposit. Seller agrees to,
and does hereby, waive any requirement for the posting of a bond in connection
with any equitable relief hereunder in favor of Purchaser. If
specific performance is not granted, then Purchaser may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to, and pursue its rights set forth in, clause (i) above.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth
in Section 13.2(b) or Section 13.2(c), then the Parties, Midstream Parent and
NFGC shall have no liability or obligation hereunder as a result of such
termination, and Seller shall return the Performance Deposit to Purchaser
within ten (10) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is
terminated.

(e) If this Agreement is terminated, Purchaser shall return or destroy
(whichever is required pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement)
to Seller on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter all copies of
the Records and other information in the possession of Purchaser or obtained
or generated by Purchaser pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement any
provision of this Agreement and such Records and information shall remain
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Subject to Section 15.11, time is of the essence in this Agreement and all
time limits shall be strictly construed and enforced. Subject to the
foregoing, however, the failure or delay of any Party

delay or failure to enforce the rights when the right or obligation arose.

 

15.8 _Applicable Law_.

 

The provisions of this Agreement and the relationship of the Parties shall be
governed and interpreted according to the Laws of the State of Texas without

issues, which shall be governed by the Laws of the state where the relevant

Stock Consideration, if any, which shall be governed by the Laws of the State
of New Jersey without giving effect to principles of conflicts of Laws.

 

15.9 _Severance of Invalid Provisions_.

 

In case of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of any applicable Law, the provisions of Law shall govern over the
provisions of this Agreement. If, for any reason and for so long as, any
clause or provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable or unconscionable under
any present or future Law (or interpretation thereof), the remainder of this
Agreement shall not be affected by such illegality or invalidity. Any such
invalid provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement as if this
Agreement had been executed with the invalid provision eliminated.

The interpretation and construction of the terms of this Agreement will be
governed by the following conventions:

 

15.10.1 _Headings for Convenience_.

numbering sequences and paragraph headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall in no way define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of this Agreement or any part thereof, nor have any legal effect.

 

15.10.2 _Gender_ __ _ and Number_.

 

The use of pronouns in whatever gender or number shall be deemed to be a
proper reference to the Parties to this Agreement though the Parties may be

changes required to make the provisions of this Agreement refer to the correct
gender or number shall in all instances be assumed as though each case was
fully expressed.

15.10.3 _Independent Representation_.

 

Each Party has had the benefit of independent legal representation with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and has had the opportunity
to exercise business discretion in relation to

 



81

    

 the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arms length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. This Agreement shall be construed fairly and reasonably and not
more strictly against one Party than another, on the basis of who drafted this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

subsections are references to the articles, sections or subsections of this

connection with the Closing hereunder contain the final and entire agreement
of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this contract. There are
no representations, warranties or promises, oral or written, between the
Parties other than those included in this Agreement or in any such Closing
document. Upon execution of this Agreement by all Parties and absent Fraud,
this Agreement shall supersede and replace all previous negotiations,
understandings or promises, whether written or oral, relative to the subject
of this Agreement. Absent Fraud, each of the Parties acknowledges that no
other Party has made any promise, representation or warranty that is not
expressly stated in this Agreement or in any Closing document. This Agreement
shall not be modified or changed (nor any provision of this Agreement waived)
except by a written amendment signed by all the Parties. This Agreement is
entire as to all the performances to be rendered under it, and breach of any
provision shall constitute a breach of the entire Agreement. A waiver of any
breach or failure to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
shall not in any way affect, limit or waive a Partys rights under
this Agreement at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with any
other term or condition of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event that Closing occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
terminated in its entirety effective as of the Closing Date, except as to the
Excluded Assets.

 

15.13 _Binding Effect_.

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

15.14 _Multiple Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed by signing the original or a counterpart

Parties had signed the same instrument.

ARTICLE 16

 

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

16.1 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

In the event that any Arbitrable Dispute arises, the Parties shall first seek
to resolve such dispute by negotiations as provided in this Article 16
between senior representatives who have authority to settle the controversy. "
_Arbitrable Dispute_ " means (except for: (a) disputes involving Environmental
Defects or any cure relating thereto, which will be resolved as provided in
Section __ 3.2(g), or (b) __ any matters to be resolved by the Accounting
Referee as provided in Section __ 8.2(b)), any and all disputes, claims,
counterclaims, demands, causes of action, controversies and other matters in
question arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any alleged breach hereof, including any
disputes regarding a Partys indemnification obligations pursuant to Article
11 or relating to matters that are the subject of this Agreement or the
relationship between the Parties under this Agreement, regardless of whether
(i) __ extra-contractual in nature, (ii) __ sounding in contract, tort or
otherwise, (iii) __ provided for by Law or otherwise, or (iv) __ any such
matters could result in damages or any other relief, whether at Law, in equity
or otherwise; but the term " _Arbitrable Dispute_ " does not include any
claim for injunctive relief. Any claim for injunctive relief can only be
sought through a court of competent jurisdiction. The sole and exclusive venue
and forum for any action for injunctive relief brought in connection with
this Agreement is any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located
in Harris County, Texas.

 

(a) _Notification_. When an Arbitrable Dispute exists, each Party has the
right to give the other Party written notice of the Arbitrable Dispute.

(b) _Meeting_ _Between_ _Senior Representatives_. Senior representatives
of the Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within
fifteen (15) days after a Partys receipt of the notice of the Arbitrable
Dispute in order to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve
the matter. If a senior representative intends to be accompanied to a meeting
by an attorney, he or she shall give the other Partys senior representatives
at least three (3) Business Days notice of such intention so that he or she
also can be accompanied by an attorney. If a Partys senior representative
does not meet with the other Partys senior representative within such fifteen
(15) day period, the other Party may, at such Partys sole option, proceed
directly to arbitration under Section 16.2.

 

(c) _Confidentiality_. All offers, promises, conduct and statements,
whether oral or written, made in the course of meetings between senior
representatives, by any of the Parties, their agents, employees, experts and
attorneys and by any CPR employees, are confidential, privileged and
inadmissible for any purpose including impeachment, in any arbitration or
other proceeding involving the Parties, provided that evidence that is
otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or
non-discoverable as a result of its use in the meetings between senior
representatives.

16.2 _Arbitration_.

 

Any Arbitrable Dispute not resolved by agreement of the Parties pursuant to
Section 16.1 shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
arbitration using three (3) arbitrators applying by reference the arbitration
rules of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and

 



84

    

 Resolution (" _CPR_ ") Non-Administered Arbitration Rules, as supplemented
by the CPR Protocol on Disclosure of Documents and Presentation of Witnesses
in Commercial Arbitration (" _CPR Protocol_ "), as currently in effect on the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Rules_ "). If there is any
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the Rules, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.

(a) Arbitration must be initiated within the applicable time limits set
forth in this Agreement and not thereafter or if no time limit is given in
this Agreement, within the time period allowed by the applicable statute of
limitations; _provided, however_ , that if a Party files a notice of
Arbitrable Dispute within the applicable time limits or limitations period but
such Arbitrable Dispute is not resolved before the expiration of the
applicable time limits or limitations period, the time period for initiating
arbitration for that specific Arbitrable Dispute shall be extended for ninety
(90) calendar days. Arbitration, if initiated, must be initiated by a Party ("
_Claimant_ ") sending written notice on the other Party ("Respondent")
that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding
arbitration.

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days of written notice electing to refer the
Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration the Seller shall appoint one (1)
arbitrator and the Purchaser shall appoint one (1) arbitrator. The two (2)
arbitrators so appointed shall select the third arbitrator, and failing
agreement on selection of the third arbitrator by the two (2) arbitrators
within thirty (30) days after their appointment, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the CPR in accordance with the Rules. Each appointer of the
first two (2) arbitrators shall pay the compensation and expenses of the
arbitrator it appoints. The Seller shall pay one-half (1/2) of the
compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator and the Purchaser shall pay
the other half. All arbitrators must (i) be neutral persons who have never
been officers, directors, employees, or consultants or had other business or
personal relationships (except acting as arbitrator) with the Parties or any
of their Affiliates, officers, directors or employees and (ii) have experience
in or be knowledgeable about the matters in dispute. The location of all
arbitration proceedings shall be Houston, Texas.

(c) The Parties and the arbitrators shall proceed diligently so that the
award can be made as promptly as possible. If the amount in controversy is
less than or equal to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the hearing shall
commence within forty-five (45) Business Days after the selection of the third
arbitrator. If the amount in controversy exceeds One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), the hearing shall commence at such time as agreed by the Parties
and the arbitrators but no later than three (3) months after the selection of
the third arbitrator. Expedited discovery will be permitted if and as agreed
by the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree, the arbitrators shall
resolve any discovery disputes consistent with the Rules. The arbitrators
shall render an award in writing, setting forth the reasons supporting their
decision, within thirty (30) days after the close of proceedings.

 

(d) Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the
arbitrators shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. In
rendering any decision or award, the arbitrators must abide by all terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

(e) The Parties shall each bear their own costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in arbitrating any Arbitrable Dispute, although the
arbitrator may permit the prevailing Party to recover attorneys fees and
costs to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



85

    

16.3 _Expedited Dispute Resolution for Purposes of Section 5.1.1(d) and
5.1.2(d)_.

(a) In order for Purchaser to assert that the condition in 5.1.1(d) has
not been satisfied, Purchaser shall deliver notice thereof to Seller on or
before the Defect Claim Date. Such notice (the " _Purchaser_ __ _s 5.1.1(d)_
_Notice_ ") shall include: (i) with respect to the asserted Environmental
Defects, a written description meeting the requirements of Section 3.2(a),
together with all supporting documentation (which shall be due on the Defect
Claim Date in order to validly assert that the 5.1.1(d) condition has not
been satisfied), (ii) Purchasers estimate of all losses associated with
uncured Casualty Losses, together with all supporting documentation (
_provided_ , that Purchaser may update its Purchasers 5.1.1(d) Notice at any
time prior to Closing for any Casualty Loss occurring after the Defect Claim
Date), and (iii) the Allocated Values of the Assets withheld from Closing
pursuant to Section 4.2. In the event the Parties do not agree whether the
condition in Section 5.1.1(d) has been satisfied, Closing shall be extended
until the relevant arbitrator or arbitrators (each, a " _5.1.1(d)_
_Arbitrator_ ") has determined whether or not such condition has
been satisfied using the following procedure: Seller shall provide to the
5.1.1(d) Arbitrator and Purchaser a written response setting forth Sellers
position with respect to the matters described in Purchasers 5.1.1(d) Notice
together with all supporting documentation within twelve (12) Business Days
after receipt of Purchasers 5.1.1(d) Notice. Seller shall also include with
its submission to the 5.1.1(d) Arbitrator a copy of Purchasers 5.1.1(d)
Notice. The 5.1.1(d) Arbitrator shall make its determination in accordance
with Section 3.2(g)(v), _mutatis mutandis_ , except it shall have ten (10)
Business Days to make a determination as to the existence and amount of the
matters asserted in Purchasers 5.5.1(d) Notice and the reference in Section
3.2(g)(v) to five (5) Business Days notice shall be changed to two (2)
Business Days notice.

 

(b) The 5.1.1(d) Arbitrator with respect to disputes relating to
Environmental Defects shall be a single arbitrator (the " _5.1.1(d)
Environmental Arbitrator_ "), determined as described in Section 16.3(d)
below. The 5.1.1(d) Environmental Arbitrator shall be a licensed environmental
engineer or environmental attorney with at least ten (10) years experience
assessing the environmental condition of oil and gas properties in the state
where the Environmental Defect Property at issue is located and who has not
performed material services for either Party or their Affiliates in the prior
five (5) years.

(c) The 5.1.1(d) Arbitrator with respect to disputes relating to Casualty
Losses shall be a single arbitrator (the " _5.1.1 (d)_ _Casualty Loss
Arbitrator_ "), determined as described in Section 16.3(d) below. The
arbitrator shall be a licensed appraiser with at least ten (10) years
experience appraising oil and gas personal property and equipment in the state
where the Casualty Loss at issue is located and who has not performed material
services for either Party or their Affiliates in the prior five (5) years.

(d) Within three (3) Business Days following Sellers receipt
of Purchasers 5.1.1(d) Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall each exchange
lists of five (5) acceptable, qualified arbitrators for the 5.1.1(d)
Environmental Arbitrator and the 5.1.1(d) Casualty Loss Arbitrator, as
applicable. Within three (3) Business Days following the exchange of lists of
acceptable arbitrators, Purchaser and Seller shall select by mutual agreement
one arbitrator to serve as the 5.1.1(d) Environmental Arbitrator and/or the
5.1.1(d) Casualty Loss Arbitrator, as applicable, from the combined lists. If
no agreement is reached, Purchaser and Seller shall each, by 5:00 pm Central
Time on the second Business Day, identify a single arbitrator from their
original lists of five 

 



86

    

 (5) acceptable arbitrators. The two (2) selected arbitrators shall then
together select a third arbitrator from the original lists within three (3)
Business Days following their selection. Such third arbitrator shall serve as
the applicable Arbitrator. __

 _CERTIFICATE OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS_

 

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") provides that a
transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the
transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. federal income tax purposes
(including Section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity will
be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform
Seneca Resources Company, LLC ("Seneca") and NFG Midstream Covington, LLC
("NFG"), the transferees of a U.S. real property interest (Seneca and NFG
together, "Transferee"), that withholding of tax is not required in
connection with the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Shell Oil
Company (the owner of SWEPI LP, which has legal title to a U.S. real property
interest under local law but is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) ("Transferor"), the undersigned hereby certifies to the best of
his knowledge the following on behalf of Transferor, solely in his capacity as
an attorney-in-fact of Transferor:



   1. |

Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust,
or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder); 

---|--- 



   2. |

SWEPI LP is a disregarded entity (as defined in Treasury Regulation
§ 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii)) and is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Transferor; 

---|--- 



   3. |

Transferor is not a disregarded entity (as defined in Treasury Regulation §
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii)); 

---|--- 



   4. |

Transferors U.S. employer identification number is [***]; and 

---|--- 
 



   5. |

Transferors office address is P.O. Box, 2463 Houston, Texas 77252-2463. 

---|--- 
 

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

   

Under penalties of perjury, the undersigned declares that he has
examined this certification, and, to the best of his knowledge and belief, it
is true, correct, and complete, and he further declares that he has the
authority to sign this document on behalf of Transferor.

        |

 manifestations of them then in the possession of the affiliate to

If required by Applicable Laws, and if necessary in the normal course of
Licensees business, Licensee may disclose the Data to appropriate
governmental agencies having jurisdiction, provided that Owner consents in
writing, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, and provided
further that Licensee promptly informs Owner in writing of full details of
each request for the Data, to whom the disclosure is to be made and the reason
for such disclosure, such writing to be provided as soon as practicable prior

of the whole License Agreement or any unperformed balance thereof. 

---|--- 



   10. |

On the effective date of any termination, cancellation or expiration of this
License Agreement, the right and license granted herein to Licensee shall

      15. |

In the event any provision, clause, article, section, sentence or part of this
License Agreement is inconsistent with or contrary to any applicable law,
same shall be deemed to be modified to the extent required to comply with said

force and effect. Any provision of this License Agreement, which may be ruled

or reasonably requested by the Holder to enable the Holder to consummate a
public sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
timing and method or methods of distribution thereof.

 

(f) In the event a Holder transfers Registrable Securities included on a
Registration Statement and such Registrable Securities remain Registrable
Securities following such transfer, at the request of such Holder, the Company
shall amend or supplement such Registration Statement as may be necessary in
order to enable such transferee to offer and sell such Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement; _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company be required to file a post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement unless (i) such Registration Statement includes only Registrable
Securities held by the Holder, Affiliates of the Holder or transferees of the
Holder or (ii) the Company has received written consent therefor

G-7

    

 from a Person for whom Registrable Securities have been registered on (but
not yet sold under) such Registration Statement, other than the Holder,
Affiliates of the Holder or transferees of the Holder.

(g) The Companys obligation to include the Holders Registrable Securities
in any Registration Statement or related prospectus is contingent upon the
Holder: (i) furnishing to the Company in writing the Holders information with
respect to its ownership of Registrable Securities to be included in any
Registration Statement, amendment or supplement thereto or prospectus in
connection therewith and the intended method of disposition of such
Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request or as may be
required by applicable law for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or prospectus (or amendment or supplement thereto) and all
information required to be disclosed in order to make the information Holder
previously furnished to the Company not contain a material misstatement of
fact or necessary to cause such Registration Statement or prospectus (or
amendment or supplement thereto) not to omit a material fact with respect to
Holder necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii)
providing reasonable assistance to the Company with its compliance with (A)
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the guidance of the staff of the
Commission thereunder, (B) all applicable state securities laws, (C) the
rules of any securities exchange or trading market on which the Companys
Common Stock is listed or traded and (D) all other applicable regulations, in
each case, in connection with the registration and the disposition
of Registrable Securities; (iii) following its actual knowledge thereof,
notifying the Company of the occurrence of any event that makes any statement
made in a Registration Statement, prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus
or other free writing prospectus regarding the Holder that is based on
written information furnished by the Holder to the Company for the express
purpose of inclusion therein untrue in any material respect or that requires
the making of any changes in a Registration Statement, Prospectus or free
writing prospectus so that, in such regard, it will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements not misleading; and (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the Company in preparing the applicable
Registration Statement (including any amendment or supplement thereto) and any
related prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

 

Section 3.2 _Underwritten and Piggyback Offerings_.

 

(a) _Requested Underwritten Offering_. The Holder shall have the option
and right, exercisable by delivering written notice to the Company of its
intention to distribute Registrable Securities by means of an Underwritten
Offering (an " _Underwritten Offering Notice_ "), to require the Company,
pursuant to the terms of and subject to the limitations of this Agreement, to
effectuate a distribution of at least $50 million of its Registrable
Securities by means of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an effective
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities (a " _Requested
Underwritten Offering_ "); _provided_ that the Holder shall only be permitted
to exercise this option and right twice hereunder. The Underwritten Offering
Notice must set forth the number of Registrable Securities that such Holder
intends to include in such Requested Underwritten Offering. The Managing
Underwriter of a Requested Underwritten Offering shall be designated by the
Holder, subject to the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this _Section_
__ _ 3.2(a)_, an offering shall be deemed to be a Requested Underwritten
Offering at the time that the Underwritten Offering Notice has been delivered
to the Company; _provided_ that no Requested

 



G-8

    

 Underwritten Offering shall be considered as having been effected if, on no
more than two occasions, an Underwritten Offering Notice shall have been
delivered but no Prospectus was filed with the Commission with respect to
such offering and the offering was not launched within fifteen Business Days
of the delivery of such Underwritten Offering Notice. To the fullest extent
possible, the Holder shall control the timeline and tenor of negotiations
with respect to any Requested Underwritten Offering.

(b) _Piggyback Offering_. If the Company shall at any time following the
Repurchase Period propose to conduct a registered offering of its Common Stock
for cash, whether for its own account or for the account of one or more
stockholders of the Company, under the Securities Act (other than any
registration (i) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or other
registration solely relating to an offering or sale to employees or directors
of the Company pursuant to any employee stock plan or other employee benefit
arrangement), (ii) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or
similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or any successor rule thereto), (iii) in connection with any
dividend or distribution reinvestment or similar plan or (iv) pursuant to any
"at-the-market" offering), then the Company shall promptly notify the Holder
of such proposal reasonably in advance of (and in any event at least two
Business Days before in connection with a "bought deal" or Overnight
Underwritten Offering) the commencement of the offering, which notice shall
set forth the principal terms and conditions of the issuance, including the
proposed offering price (or range of offering prices), the anticipated filing
date of the related registration statement (if applicable) and the number of
shares of Common Stock that are proposed to be registered (the " _Piggyback
Notice_ "). Receipt of any Piggyback Notice required to be provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ to the Holder shall be kept confidential by the
Holder (except that the Holder may share such Piggyback Notice with its legal,
financial and other advisors that are under a confidentiality agreement with
the Holder or owe the holder a duty of confidentiality) until such proposed
offering is (i) publicly announced or (ii) the Holder receives notice that
such proposed offering has been abandoned, which such notice shall be provided
promptly by the Company to the Holder. The Piggyback Notice shall offer the
Holder the opportunity to include in such offering (and any related
registration, if applicable) the number of Registrable Securities as the
Holder may request in writing (a " _Piggyback Offering_ "); _provided,
however_ , that in the event that the Company proposes to effectuate the
subject offering pursuant to an effective Shelf Registration Statement of the
Company other than an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, only
Registrable Securities of the Holder which are subject to an effective Shelf
Registration Statement may be included in such offering, unless the Company is
then able to file an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, the filing of the same including
Registrable Securities of Holders that are not otherwise included in an
effective Shelf Registration Statement would not have a material adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Stock in such
Piggyback Offering. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
include in each such Piggyback Offering such Registrable Securities for which
the Company has a received written request for inclusion therein ("
_Piggyback Request_ ") within three Business Days after sending the Piggyback
Notice (or one Business Day in connection with a "bought deal" or Overnight
Underwritten Offering). The Company may postpone or withdraw the filing or
the effectiveness of a registration in connection with a Piggyback Offering at
any time in its sole discretion. A Piggyback Offering shall not be considered
a Requested Underwritten Offering for purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_.
The Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of such Holders
Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Offering at any time, and such Holder
shall continue to have the right 

 



G-9

    

 to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent Underwritten
Offerings, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Managing
Underwriter of any Piggyback Offering that is an Underwritten Offering shall
be designated by the Company.

(c) _Priority in Underwritten Offerings_. In connection with an
Underwritten Offering, if the Managing Underwriter of any such Underwritten
Offering advises the Company and the Holder in writing, that the total amount
of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock) that the Holder and any other Persons
(including the Company) intend to include in such Underwritten Offering (and
any related registration, if applicable) exceeds the number that can be
included in such Underwritten Offering without being likely to have an
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Stock
offered or the market for the Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock), then the Common Stock to be
included in such Underwritten Offering (in each case subject to the other
terms and provisions of this Agreement) shall include the number of shares of
Common Stock that such Managing Underwriter advises the Company can be sold
without having such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated as
follows:

 

(i) if the offering was initiated for and on behalf of the Company:

 

(A) first to the Company;

 

(B) second, to the Holder; and

 

(C) third, to all other holders of Common Stock entitled to participate in
such Underwritten Offering;

(ii) in the case of a Requested Underwritten Offering:

 

(A) first, to the Holder; and

 

(B) second, to the Company; and

 

(iii) if the offering was not initiated for and on behalf of the Company
and was initiated for and on behalf of any holder of registration rights
(other than the Holder):

 

(A) first, to the Holder;

 

(B) second, to the requesting holders, pro rata based on the number of
shares of Common Stock held by such requesting holders;

(C) third, to the Company; and

 

(D) fourth, pro rata among all other holders of Common Stock proposed to be
included in such offering based on the number of shares of Common Stock held
by such other holders.

 

Section 3.3 _Registration Procedures_. The procedures to be followed by
the Company and the Holder electing to sell Registrable Securities in a
Registration Statement pursuant to this

 



G-10

(a) The Company will (i) at least seven Business Days prior to the
anticipated filing of the Registration Statement and any related Prospectus or

Holder copies of all such documents prior to filing for review by the Holder,
its counsel and other relevant advisors and (ii) address in each such document
prior to filing with the Commission any comments as the Holder, its counsel
or other advisor reasonably shall propose prior to the filing thereof, with
the inclusion of any information pertaining to the Holder, its Registrable

respect of which the Holder has agreed to provide indemnification to the
Company or any underwriter in any filing being subject to the express prior
approval of the Holder.

 

(b) In connection with an Piggyback Offering or an Underwritten Offering,
the Company will (i) at least five Business Days (or one Business Day in the
case of any Overnight Underwritten Offering or "bought deal") prior to the
anticipated filing of any initial Registration Statement that identifies the
Holder and any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto
(other than amendments and supplements that do not materially alter the
previous disclosure and do nothing more than name Holder and provide
information with respect thereto as was provided by the Holder in writing to
the Company expressly for the purpose of inclusion therein), as applicable,
furnish to the Holder copies of any such Registration Statement or related
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto that identify the Holder and any
related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than
amendments and supplements that do not materially alter the previous
disclosure or do nothing more than name Holder and provide information with
respect thereto as was provided by the Holder in writing to the Company
expressly for the purpose of inclusion therein) for review by the Holder, its
counsel and other relevant advisors prior to filing and (ii) address in each
such document prior to filing with the Commission any comments as the Holder,
its counsel or other advisor reasonably shall propose prior to the filing
thereof, with the inclusion of any information pertaining to the Holder, its
Registrable Securities, the intended method of distribution or
other information in respect of which the Holder has agreed to provide
indemnification to the Company or any underwriter in any filing being subject

(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as
reasonably practicable (i) prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements to each
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be necessary under applicable law to keep such Registration Statement
continuously effective with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities covered thereby for its Effectiveness Period and, subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement, prepare and file with the Commission
such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under
the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities held by the Holder and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such additional Registration
Statements to become effective as soon as practicable after the filing
thereof (it being understood and agreed that, during any period during the
Effectiveness Period when there is not an effective Registration Statement 

 



G-11

    

 covering the Registrable Securities, the time remaining under the
Effectiveness Period shall be tolled until such time as an additional
Registration Statement has become effective); (ii) cause the related
Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required prospectus
supplement, and as so supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
(including in connection with any Underwritten Offering, to promptly
incorporate such information as is reasonably requested by the Managing
Underwriter(s) or the Holder participating in such Underwritten Offering to be
included therein, the purchase price for the securities to be paid by the
underwriters and any other applicable terms of such Underwritten Offering);
(iii) respond to any comments received from the Commission with respect to
each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and promptly provide the
Holder true and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the
Commission relating to such Registration Statement but not any comments that,
in the opinion of the Companys counsel, would result in the disclosure to the
Holder of material and non-public information concerning the Company; and
(iv) cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by
such other governmental agencies or authorities (including making any filings
with FINRA as may be required in order to obtain FINRAs preclearance or
preapproval of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus or any other
filings required to be made with, or approvals required to be obtained from,
FINRA) as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the
Company to enable the holders of such Registrable Securities to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with their intended
method of distribution thereof.

 

(d) The Company will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including all rules and regulations
of the Commission, with respect to the Registration Statements and the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by each Registration
Statement.

 

(e) The Company will promptly notify the Holder and, if applicable, the
Managing Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering: (i)(A) when a Prospectus
or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
Statement in which the Holder is included has been filed; (B) when the
Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a "review" of the
applicable Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments orally
or in writing on such Registration Statement (in which case the Company shall
provide true and complete copies or otherwise keep the Holder apprised (if
oral comments are received) thereof and all written responses thereto and
otherwise keep the Holder apprised of any oral responses thereto to the Holder
unless, in the opinion of the Companys counsel, such information
contains material, non-public information of the Company); and (C) with
respect to each applicable Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, when the same has been declared effective; (ii) of any
request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority
for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or
for additional information that pertains to the Holder as a seller
of Registrable Securities; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement
covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any
Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such
purpose; and (v) of the occurrence (but not the details) of any event or
passage of time that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be

 



G-12

    

 incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that
requires any revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other
documents so that, in the case of such Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Holder agrees
that, upon receipt of notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event
of the kind described in clauses (ii) through (v) of this  _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)_, the Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities under such Registration Statement until the Holder has received
copies of the supplemental Prospectus or amended Registration Statement or
until the Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
applicable Prospectus may be resumed (a " _Suspension Period_ "). Upon an
occurrence of any event of the kind described in clause (ii), at
the direction of the Holder, the Company shall provide the Commission or any
such other federal or state governmental authority any such requested
amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any
such additional information that pertains to the Holder as a seller of
Registrable Securities.

(f) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance
of or, if issued, will promptly obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any
suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of
the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, or if any such order or suspension is made effective
during any Blackout Period, as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
Blackout Period is over.

(g) During the Effectiveness Period, the Company will furnish to the
Holder, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration
Statement and each amendment thereto and all exhibits to the extent requested
by the Holder (including those incorporated by reference) promptly after the
filing of such documents with the Commission; _provided_ that the Company
will not have any obligation to provide any document pursuant to this clause
that is available on the Commissions EDGAR system.

 

(h) The Company will promptly deliver to the Holder such documents as the
Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period including, without
charge, as many copies of each Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form
of prospectus) authorized by the Company for use and each amendment or
supplement thereto as the Holder may reasonably request and. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, the Company consents to the use of such Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Holder in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and
any amendment or supplement thereto.

 

(i) The Company will provide or maintain a transfer agent and registrar
(which may be the same entity) for all such Registrable Securities. The
Company will cooperate with the Holder to facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be
delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which
certificates shall be free of all restrictive legends indicating that the
Registrable Securities are unregistered or unqualified for resale under the
Securities Act, Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws, and to
enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as the Holder may request in writing. In connection therewith,
if required by the Companys

 



G-13

    

 transfer agent, the Company will promptly, after the Effective Date of the
Registration Statement, cause an opinion of counsel as to the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement to be delivered to and maintained with its
transfer agent, together with any other authorizations, certificates and
directions required by the transfer agent which authorize and direct the
transfer agent to issue such Registrable Securities without any such legend
upon sale by the Holder of such Registrable Securities under the Registration
Statement.

 

(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section_ __ _
3.3(e)(v)_, the Company will promptly prepare a supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, if required by applicable law, to the
affected Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or
any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference,
and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, no
Registration Statement nor any Prospectus will contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall provide
such amendment, supplement or other document to the Holder or its transferee,
in the amount of copies that may be requested by the Holder or its
transferee, without charge.

(k) With respect to Underwritten Offerings, subject to the right of the
Holder to withdraw such Holders Registrable Securities from an Underwritten
Offering in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) the right of any
Holder to include such Holders Registrable Securities in an Underwritten
Offering shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein, (ii) the Holder participating in
such Underwritten Offering agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form and sell the Holders Registrable Securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled to
select the Managing Underwriter hereunder and (iii) the Holder participating
in such Underwritten Offering agrees to complete and execute all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities (with customary limitations
on liability), underwriting agreements and other documents customarily and
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements;
_provided_ that, in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
no holder of Registrable Securities included in any Underwritten Offering
shall be required to make any representations or warranties to the Company or
the underwriters (other than customary representations and warranties of
selling stockholders, including such holders ownership of its shares of
Common Stock to be sold in the offering and such holders intended method of
distribution) or to undertake any indemnification obligations to the Company
or the underwriters with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in and
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_. The Company hereby agrees with the
Holder that, in connection with any Underwritten Offering in accordance with
the terms hereof, it will negotiate in good faith and execute all
indemnities, underwriting and lockup agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using
all its reasonable best efforts to procure customary legal opinions, negative
assurance letters, and auditor "comfort" letters of the Company and any
consents of any independent public accountants, independent petroleum
engineers or other Persons necessary in connection with the filing of any
Registration Statement or Prospectus in connection therewith. In connection
with any Underwritten Offering, the Company shall promptly prepare and file or
cause to be prepared and filed all of the documents referenced in Section
3.1(e) (both with respect to any "blue sky" or other securities laws of other
jurisdictions and listing (or maintaining the listing) of

 



G-14

    

 the Registrable on the Trading Market and do any and all of the other acts
and things referenced in Section __ _ 3.1(e)_, in each case that may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate or reasonably requested by the Holder or
any underwriter to enable the Holder or such underwriter to consummate a
public sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
timing and method or methods of distribution thereof.

 

(l) In connection with any Requested Underwritten Offering, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as the Holder or
any underwriter reasonably requests in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities subject to such Requested
Underwritten Offering and to cause appropriate officers and employees to be
available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with
prospective investors, underwriters and their representatives in
presentations, meetings, due diligence sessions and road shows. In connection
with any Requested Underwritten Offering, the Company shall make available,
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, for inspection by any
selling holder of Registrable Securities, any underwriter participating in any
disposition pursuant to any Registration Statement and any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by any such holder or underwriter
(collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "), all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the
Companys officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection with such
Registration Statement.

 

(m) Without duplication of its agreements in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(g)_, the
Holder agrees to furnish to the Company any other information regarding the
Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company reasonably
determines is required to be included in any Registration Statement or any
Prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to an Underwritten Offering.

(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
shall not be required to file a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) (or, if the Company has filed a Shelf Registration Statement and has
included Registrable Securities therein, the Company shall be entitled
to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement) for a period of up to 60 days if (i) the Board of the
Company determines that a postponement is in the best interest of the Company
and its stockholders generally because any registration or offering of
Registrable Securities hereunder would reasonably be expected to, if not
delayed or suspended, have a material adverse effect on a pending merger,
acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or
other similar transaction involving the Company that, in each case, if
consummated, would be material to the Company, (ii) the Board of the Company
determines such registration would render the Company unable to comply with
applicable securities laws or (iii) the Board of the Company determines such
registration would require disclosure of material, non-public information that
the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential
and that would not otherwise be required to be disclosed at such time (any
such period, a " _Blackout Period_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall not
delay filing any Registration Statement or delay or suspend the offer or sale
of any Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement more than
twice in any 12-month period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall any Blackout Periods or any Suspension
Periods collectively continue for more than 60 days in the aggregate during
any 12-month period.

 



G-15

    

Section 3.4 _No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights_. The Company
shall not hereafter enter into during the Effectiveness Period, and is not
currently a party to, any agreement with respect to its securities that is
inconsistent in any material respect with the rights granted to the Holder by
this Agreement, and any such agreement shall be considered void _ab initio_.
If the Company grants any registration or similar rights to third parties,
such rights will be expressly subordinated to the Holders rights hereunder.

Section 3.5 _Registration Expenses_. All Registration Expenses incident
to the Parties performance of or compliance with their respective
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any Required
Registration, Requested Underwritten Offering or Piggyback Offering (in each
case, excluding any Selling Expenses) shall be borne by the Company, whether
or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement. "Registration Expenses" shall include, without limitation, (i) all
registration and filing fees (including fees and expenses (A) with respect to
filings required to be made with the Trading Market, (B) in compliance with
applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and (C) with respect to filings

certificates for Company Securities and of printing Prospectuses if the
printing of Prospectuses is reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable
Securities included in the Registration Statement), (iii) messenger,
telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel,
auditors, accountants and independent petroleum engineers for the Company, (v)
Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company so desires such insurance,
(vi) fees and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Company in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (vii) all expenses relating to marketing the sale of the
Registrable Securities, including expenses related to conducting a "road
show." In addition, the Company shall be responsible for all of its expenses
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including expenses payable to third parties and including
all salaries and expenses of their officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit and the fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities on the
Trading Market.

 

Section 3.6 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of
Registrable Securities, including the Holder, such holders officers,
directors, managers, members, partners, stockholders, employees and
Affiliates, and each other Controlling Person, if any, who controls any of the
foregoing Persons (collectively, " _Holder Indemnified Persons_ "), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, costs (including
reasonable costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising
from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any Holder
Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state
blue sky securities laws (collectively, " _Losses_ "), as incurred, arising
out of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement under which any Registrable
Securities were registered, in any preliminary prospectus (if the Company
authorized the use of such preliminary prospectus prior to the Effective
Date), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus (if
such free writing prospectus was authorized for

 



G-16

    

 use by the Company) or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used
during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or any violation or
alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any other similar
federal or state securities laws applicable to the Company and relating to any
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any
Registration Statement or any registration or disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement, and the Company shall
reimburse each Holder Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Holder Indemnified Person in connection with
investigating, defending or settling any such Loss; _provided, however_ , that
the Company shall not be liable to any Holder Indemnified Person to the extent
that any such claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
Registration Statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or free
writing prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf
of such Holder Indemnified Person specifically for use in the preparation
thereof. The Company shall notify the Holder promptly of the institution,
threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which the Company is aware in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have
and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Person or any indemnified
party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the Holder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this  _Section_ __ _ 3.6_
shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.

 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Holder
participates, the Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, and each Controlling Person who controls any
of the foregoing Persons (collectively, " _Company Indemnified Persons_ "),
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and
all Losses as incurred, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any such Registration
Statement, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the Effective Date
of such Registration Statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or free
writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during
the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent
that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating
to the Holder furnished in writing to the Company by the Holder expressly for
use therein, and the Holder shall reimburse each Company Indemnified Person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Company
Indemnified Person in connection with investigating, defending or settling
any such Loss. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Holder
may otherwise have and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any indemnified party.
In no event shall the liability of the Holder hereunder be greater in amount
than the dollar amount of the net proceeds actually received by the Holder
from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification obligation.

 



G-17

    

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties may exist with respect to such claim or there may be reasonable
defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed,
the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such
consent will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not
entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition
to any local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to such indemnified party that are in addition to or may conflict
with those available to another indemnified party with respect to such claim.
Failure to give prompt written notice shall not release the indemnifying party
from its obligations hereunder.

 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified
party with respect to any Losses referred to herein, the indemnifying party,
in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent
permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state
a material fact that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of
the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission; _provided_ that in no event
shall any contribution by the Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from
the offering actually received by the Holder

 

Section 3.7 _Rule 144 Compliance_. With a view to making available to the
holders of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule
or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a holder to sell
securities of the Company to the public without registration, the Company
shall:

 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times after the date hereof;

(b) use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, at any time after the date hereof;
and

 

(c) furnish to any holder so long as the holder owns Registrable
Securities, promptly upon request, a written statement by the Company as to
its compliance with the reporting

 



G-18

    

 requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such
other reports and documents so filed or furnished by the Company as such
holder may reasonably request in connection with the sale of Registrable
Securities without registration; _provided_ that the Company will not have any
obligation to provide any document pursuant to this clause that is available
on the Commissions EDGAR system.

REPURCHASE OPTION

 

Section 4.1 _Repurchase Option_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the later
of (i) the 90th day following the date hereof and (ii) the second Business
Day following the date that the Company files its annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (such period, the " _Repurchase
Period_ "), the Company shall have the irrevocable right and option (the "
_Repurchase Option_ "), but not the obligation, to repurchase from time to
time from the Holder (and any of its Affiliates holding Shares) all or a
portion of the Shares at a price per Share (the " _Repurchase Price_ ") equal
to the lesser of (x) the volume weighted average share price of Common Stock
on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. under the function "VWAP") for the
fifteen (15) consecutive trading Business Days ending on and including the
first (1st) trading Business Day preceding the date on which the Repurchase
Notice is delivered and (y) an amount equal to 110% of the Share Price;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Repurchase Price be less than the Share
Price.

 

(b) To exercise the Repurchase Option, the Company shall send notice
thereof (the " _Repurchase Notice_ ") to the Holder, which notice shall set
forth the Repurchase Price, the number of Shares to be repurchased pursuant to
such Repurchase Option (the " _Repurchase Shares_ ") and the date on which
the closing of the purchase and sale of the Repurchase Shares shall occur (the
" _Repurchase Date_ "), which date shall be not earlier than one (1) Business
Day following delivery of the Repurchase Notice and not later than the later
of (i) the last day of the Repurchase Period and (ii) five (5) Business Days
following delivery of the Repurchase Notice. On the Repurchase Date, the
Company shall pay (or caused to be paid), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Holder, an amount
equal to (x) the Repurchase Price, multiplied by (y) the number of Repurchase
Shares. Upon payment of such amount by the Company at the closing of the
Repurchase Option (in accordance with any necessary action or authorization of
the Board of the Company, which action shall be the sole responsibility of the
Company), the Repurchase Shares will no longer be outstanding, will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Each of the Company and
the Holder shall (and the Holder shall cause its Affiliates to) cooperate with
the other Party and take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate the closing of the Repurchase Option and give effect to the
forgoing transfer and cancellation of the Repurchase Shares, except that any
out-of-pocket costs or expenses in connection with such transfer and
cancellation, including any reasonable attorneys fees or transfer costs or
taxes, shall be borne solely by the Company.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company delivers a Repurchase Notice
on or prior to the last day of the Repurchase Period, such Repurchase Notice
shall be effective,

 



G-19

    

 and the Company and the Holder (and its Affiliates, as applicable) shall
proceed with the closing of the purchase and sale of the Repurchase Shares
pursuant to such Repurchase Option as provided for in this _Section_ __ _
4.1_.

(d) For purposes of determining the Repurchase Price, the Share Price
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification or other change in the Common Stock which may be made by the
Company after the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.2 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the permitted successors and assigns of each of
the Parties. All of the terms, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and their respective
successors and assigns, and no other Parties (including, without limitation,
any other stockholders or creditor of the Company, or any director, officer or
employee of the Company) are intended to be benefitted by, or entitled to
enforce, this Agreement.

Section 5.3 _Assignment of Rights_. No Party hereto may transfer
or assign any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto; _provided_ that
the Holder may transfer and assign its rights to cause the Company to register
Registrable Securities under _Article III_ to (a) any of its Affiliates that
own Shares for so long as such assignee continues to be an Affiliate of the
Holder; _provided further_ that this Agreement shall be binding upon any
transferee of Shares that is an Affiliate of the Holder as long as such

dealer registered pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, that receives
Shares in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the
Securities Act for its own account or the accounts of other qualified
institutional buyers.

 

Section 5.4 _Recapitalization, Exchanges, etc. Affecting the Stock_. The
provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein
with respect to any and all interests of the Company Group or any successor or
assign of any member of the Company Group (whether by merger, consolidation,
sale of assets or otherwise), which may be issued in respect of, in exchange
for or in substitution of, such interests, and shall be appropriately adjusted
for combinations, stock or other splits, recapitalizations, pro rata
distributions and the like occurring after the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of
this Agreement by a Party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to
and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the
right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, and each of the Parties hereby waives any and all
defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of
the court to grant such an injunction or other equitable relief or that a
remedy at law would be adequate. The existence of this right will not preclude
any such Person from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in
equity which such Person may have.

Section 5.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which
counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute
but one and the same Agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by
facsimile, portable document format (PDF) or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and effective as to each Person who
(i) executes this Agreement in the appropriate space provided in the signature
pages hereto notwithstanding the fact that other Persons who have not
executed this Agreement may be listed on the signature pages hereto and (ii)
may from time to time become a Party to this Agreement by executing a
counterpart of or joinder to this Agreement.

 



G-21

    

Section 5.7 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof.

 

Section 5.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, and all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement), will be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws. Any action against any Party relating to the foregoing
shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court
over any such action. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.

 

Section 5.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE,
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER,
RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING
IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART
OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 5.9 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 5.10 _Severability of Provisions_. In case of a conflict between
the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of any applicable law,
the provisions of law shall govern over the provisions of this Agreement. If,
for any reason and for so long as, any clause or provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid,
unenforceable or unconscionable under any present or future law (or
interpretation thereof), the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected
by such illegality or invalidity. Any such invalid provision shall be deemed
severed from this Agreement as if this Agreement had been executed with the
invalid provision eliminated.

 

Section 5.11 _Entire Agreement; Integrated Transactions_. This Agreement
and the other agreements and documents expressly referred to herein is
intended by the Parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended
to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of
the Parties in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein.
This Agreement and the other agreements and documents expressly referred to
herein or

 



G-22

    

 therein supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement shall not be
modified or changed (nor any provision of this Agreement waived) except by a
written amendment signed by all the Parties. This Agreement is entire as to
all the performances to be rendered under it, and breach of any provision
shall constitute a breach of the entire Agreement. A waiver of any breach or
failure to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not
in any way affect, limit or waive a Partys rights under this Agreement at any
time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with any other term or
condition of this Agreement.

Section 5.12 _No Presumption_. In the event any claim is made by a Party
relating to any conflict, omission, or ambiguity in this Agreement, no
presumption or burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the
fact that this Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a particular
Party or its counsel.

Section 5.13 _Further Assurances_. The Company and the Holder shall
cooperate with each other and shall take such further action and shall
execute and deliver such further documents as may be reasonably requested by
any other Party in order to carry out the provisions and purposes of this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.14 _Cumulative Remedies_. The remedies provided herein are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

Pipeline at Jackson - Tioga

(If a pooling point is used, list a specific geographic and pipeline
location):

 


 
  



 

Special Conditions:

 



1\. Condition Precedent. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations
of the parties under this Transaction Confirmation that Seneca complete a
temporary capacity release at maximum (currently $[***] per MMBTU/month)
reservation charge (subject to recall only in the event of a termination of
this Transaction Confirmation) to Shell Energy for [***] MMBtu a Day of firm
interstate Empire Pipeline, Inc., transportation under contract No. F11594
(the " _Transportation Capacity_ ") with a primary path of Sellers
interconnection with Empire at Jackson  Tioga (Point Identification Code:
EPRU91111) to Empires interconnection with TransCanada Pipeline at Chippawa
(Point Identification Code: 012000010) (the " _Transportation Path_ ") for the
entire Delivery Period free of any liens or encumbrances. Shell Energy will
have secondary receipt and delivery rights on this transportation path.


 
    

 

If the foregoing condition precedent is not satisfied by July 1, 2020, then
Shell Energy may terminate this Transaction Confirmation upon written notice
to Seneca and such termination shall be deemed to be an Event of Default under
Section 10.2 of the Contract with Shell Energy as the Non-Defaulting Party.
Seneca and Shell Energy agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and all things necessary, proper or
advisable for such Party to satisfy the condition precedent set forth in this
Special Condition 1 applicable to such Party by July 1, 2020. Seneca agrees
that Shell Energy shall not have any liability with respect to the
Transportation Capacity except to the extent such liabilities arise and are
attributable to acts or omissions by Shell Energy under the Transportation
Capacity during the Delivery Period.

 

2. Transportation Charges. During and for the Delivery Period a charge of $[***] per MMbtu will be reimbursed to Shell Energy by Seneca as partial offset of the Transportation Capacity charges for each MMbtu impacted if Empire Pipeline restricts Shell Energys ability to: (a) receive Gas into the Transportation Capacity or; (b) deliver such Gas to any delivery point on the Transportation Path of the Transportation Capacity. 

 

3. Marketing Fee. Seneca shall pay Shell Energy a $[***] per MMBtu marketing fee on the Contract Quantity specified for this Transaction Confirmation each and every Month of the Delivery Period and such fee shall be reflected in the monthly invoices exchanged between Shell Energy and Seneca. For the avoidance of any doubt, the marketing fee is not included in the Contract Price. 

4. Transporter FT Rate Changes. In the event that Empire Pipelines Maximum FT rate changes during the Delivery Period, the Contract Price will be adjusted accordingly to offset the rate change impact paid by Shell Energy to the Transporter. 

 

5. Quality. Gas delivered under this Transaction Confirmation shall be of such quality to meet the currently effective Gas quality standards set forth in Empire Pipelines effective FERC Gas Tariff; as such tariff may be changed from time to time. 

 

6. Asset Management Arrangement. 

 

A. Seneca agrees that Shell Energy shall not be obligated to utilize the
Transportation Capacity to meet its Gas purchase obligations under this
Transaction Confirmation. Seneca also agrees that Shell Energy shall be
entitled to utilize the Transportation Capacity during the Delivery Period as
Shell Energy in its sole discretion shall determine and for Shell Energys
own benefit and account and that Seneca shall not be entitled to any portion
of any profits or income realized by Shell Energy therefrom; provided that,
the foregoing shall not entitle Shell Energy to fail to perform its
obligations set forth in this Transaction Confirmation.

B. Seneca acknowledges that Shell Energy neither has nor undertakes
any fiduciary or other special duty to Seneca hereunder. The rights,
liabilities, responsibilities and remedies of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Transaction Confirmation shall be exclusively those
expressly set forth herein. Neither party is, or will represent itself as
being, a partner of, or agent or fiduciary for, the other party with respect
to the Transportation Capacity or otherwise.

 

C. The parties agree that this Transaction Confirmation along with the
temporary capacity release of the Transportation Capacity described in
Article 1 above are an Asset Management Arrangement pursuant to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commissions Order 712, 712-A, and 712-B. All required
postings of the temporary capacity release of the Transportation Capacity
shall be done in accordance with Order 712, 712-A and 712-B. Seneca agrees
that it shall provide a copy of the terms, conditions, and information to be
included in all such capacity releases postings, prior to posting such on the
applicable pipeline(s) EBB, for Shell Energys review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

D. It shall be an Event of Default under the Contract with Seneca as the
Defaulting Party if the Transportation Capacity is recalled by Seneca for any
reason other than an Event of Default by Shell Energy hereunder and
termination of this Transaction Confirmation.

 

E. In the event of the occurrence of an Early Termination Date as a result of
an Event of Default, the Defaulting Party shall pay the Non-Defaulting Party
the AMA Termination Expenses (defined below) in addition to any Net Settlement
Amount owed under the Contract. For the purposes of this Transaction
Confirmation, the " _AMA Termination Expenses_ " shall mean an amount equal
to any costs to unwind this Transaction Confirmation including any financial
hedge transactions or physical forward transactions the Non-Defaulting Party
has entered into with respect to the Transportation Capacity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the AMA Termination Expenses shall not include any costs or
expenses, which are duplicative of any costs or expenses which are already
included in the Net Settlement Amount.

F. In the event either Party terminates the Transaction Confirmation as
provided herein or under the Contract, Seneca shall recall and be responsible
for, and assume all rights and obligations for, the Transportation Capacity as
of such date of termination.

7. Other Matters:

 



Scheduling. Shell Energy shall schedule Gas with Empire Pipeline for receipt
by Empire Pipeline at the Delivery Point according to the purchase and sale
obligations agreed to under this Transaction Confirmation. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Transaction Confirmation, nothing herein shall
change the meaning or the responsibilities of the parties under Section 4.1
and 4.2 of the Base Contract.

 



Replacement Index. If the Contract Price is based on a published index (the "
_Index Price_ ") and during the term of this Contract (i) the applicable
publication is no longer published and no successor is named, or (ii) the

Pipeline at Jackson - Tioga

(If a pooling point is used, list a specific geographic and pipeline
location):

 


 
  



 

Special Conditions:

 



1\. Condition Precedent. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations
of the parties under this Transaction Confirmation that Seneca complete a
temporary capacity release at maximum (currently $[***] per MMBTU/month)
reservation charge (subject to recall only in the event of a termination of
this Transaction Confirmation) to Shell Energy for [***] MMBtu a Day of firm
interstate Empire Pipeline, Inc., transportation under contract No. F11594
(the " _Transportation Capacity_ ") with a primary path of Sellers
interconnection with Empire at Jackson  Tioga (Point Identification Code:
EPRU91111) to Empires interconnection with TransCanada Pipeline at Chippawa
(Point Identification Code: 012000010) (the " _Transportation Path_ ") for the
entire Delivery Period free of any liens or encumbrances. Shell Energy will
have secondary receipt and delivery rights on this transportation path.




 
    

 

If the foregoing condition precedent is not satisfied by July 1, 2020, then
Shell Energy may terminate this Transaction Confirmation upon written notice
to Seneca and such termination shall be deemed to be an Event of Default under
Section 10.2 of the Contract with Shell Energy as the Non-Defaulting Party.
Seneca and Shell Energy agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and all things necessary, proper or
advisable for such Party to satisfy the condition precedent set forth in this
Special Condition 1 applicable to such Party by July 1, 2020. Seneca agrees
that Shell Energy shall not have any liability with respect to the
Transportation Capacity except to the extent such liabilities arise and are
attributable to acts or omissions by Shell Energy under the Transportation
Capacity during the Delivery Period.

 

2. Transaction 2  Daily Put Option. "Put Option Contract Quantity" means such Contract Quantity of Gas per Day, up to the Maximum daily quantity ([***] MMBtu/Day), as Seneca may nominate a put to Shell Energy for sale on a particular Day, no later than 8:00 a.m. prevailing Eastern time on the Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Gas flow Day(s). If Seneca fails to make a timely nomination of the Put Option Contract Quantity then such nomination shall be considered zero. Any Put Option Contract Quantities of Gas over weekends and holidays shall be ratable, meaning equal quantities of Gas during each Day of the weekend or holiday period. For example, deliveries nominated on a Friday Trading Day for weekend delivery are for the same amount of MMBtus of Gas per Day for Saturday, Sunday and Monday unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. " _Trading Day_ " and applicable Gas flow Days shall be day(s) designated in the Next Day Trading Calendar for Physical Gas published by the Intercontinental Exchange (" _ICE_ ") for the applicable calendar year. 

3. Transportation Charges. During and for the Delivery Period a charge of $[***] per MMbtu will be reimbursed to Shell Energy by Seneca as partial offset of the Transportation Capacity charges for each MMbtu impacted if Empire Pipeline restricts Shell Energys ability to: (a) receive Gas into the Transportation Capacity or; (b) deliver such Gas to any delivery point on the Transportation Path of the Transportation Capacity. 

 

4. Marketing Fee. Seneca shall pay Shell Energy a $[***] per MMBtu marketing fee on the Contract Quantity specified in Transaction 1 for this Transaction Confirmation each and every Month of the Delivery Period and such fee shall be reflected in the monthly invoices exchanged between Shell Energy and Seneca. For the avoidance of any doubt, the marketing fee is not included in the Contract Price. 

 

5. Transporter FT Rate Changes. In the event that Empire Pipelines Maximum FT rate changes during the Delivery Period, the Contract Price will be adjusted accordingly to offset the rate change impact paid by Shell Energy to the Transporter. 

 

6. Quality. Gas delivered under this Transaction Confirmation shall be of such quality to meet the currently effective Gas quality standards set forth in Empire Pipelines effective FERC Gas Tariff; as such tariff may be changed from time to time. 

 

7. Asset Management Arrangement. 

 

A. Seneca agrees that Shell Energy shall not be obligated to utilize the
Transportation Capacity to meet its Gas purchase obligations under this
Transaction Confirmation. Seneca also agrees that Shell Energy shall be
entitled to utilize the Transportation Capacity during the Delivery Period as
Shell Energy in its sole discretion shall determine and for Shell Energys
own benefit and account and that Seneca shall not be entitled to any portion
of any profits or income realized by Shell Energy therefrom; provided that,
the foregoing shall not entitle Shell Energy to fail to perform its
obligations set forth in this Transaction Confirmation.

B. Seneca acknowledges that Shell Energy neither has nor undertakes
any fiduciary or other special duty to Seneca hereunder. The rights,
liabilities, responsibilities and remedies of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Transaction Confirmation shall be exclusively those
expressly set forth herein. Neither party is, or will represent itself as
being, a partner of, or agent or fiduciary for, the other party with respect
to the Transportation Capacity or otherwise.

 

C. The parties agree that this Transaction Confirmation along with the
temporary capacity release of the Transportation Capacity described in
Article 1 above are an Asset Management Arrangement pursuant to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commissions Order 712, 712-A, and 712-B. All required
postings of the temporary capacity release of the Transportation Capacity
shall be done in accordance with Order 712, 712-A and 712-B. Seneca agrees
that it shall provide a copy of the terms, conditions, and information to be
included in all such capacity releases postings, prior to posting such on the
applicable pipeline(s) EBB, for Shell Energys review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

D. It shall be an Event of Default under the Contract with Seneca as the
Defaulting Party if the Transportation Capacity is recalled by Seneca for any
reason other than an Event of Default by Shell Energy hereunder and
termination of this Transaction Confirmation.

 

E. In the event of the occurrence of an Early Termination Date as a result of
an Event of Default, the Defaulting Party shall pay the Non-Defaulting Party
the AMA Termination Expenses (defined below) in addition to any Net Settlement
Amount owed under the Contract. For the purposes of this
Transaction Confirmation, the " _AMA Termination Expenses_ " shall mean

 



2

            |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
    

an amount equal to any costs to unwind this Transaction Confirmation including
any financial hedge transactions or physical forward transactions the Non-
Defaulting Party has entered into with respect to the Transportation Capacity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the AMA Termination Expenses shall not include
any costs or expenses, which are duplicative of any costs or expenses which
are already included in the Net Settlement Amount.



 

F. In the event either Party terminates the Transaction Confirmation as
provided herein or under the Contract, Seneca shall recall and be responsible
for, and assume all rights and obligations for, the Transportation Capacity as
of such date of termination.



 

8. Other Matters:

 



Scheduling. Shell Energy shall schedule Gas with Empire Pipeline for receipt
by Empire Pipeline at the Delivery Point according to the purchase and sale
obligations agreed to under this Transaction Confirmation. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Transaction Confirmation, nothing herein shall
change the meaning or the responsibilities of the parties under Section 4.1
and 4.2 of the Base Contract.

 



Priority of Deliveries. Transaction 1 Contract Quantities (Baseload) will be
considered the first gas through the meter prior to delivery of the
Transaction 2 (Put Option) Contract Quantities, if any.

 



Replacement Index. If the Contract Price is based on a published index (the "
_Index Price_ ") and during the term of this Contract (i) the applicable
publication is no longer published and no successor is named, or (ii) the
applicable publication ceases to publish or update a price report providing
the information specified in the definition of the Index Price, or (iii) the
applicable publication materially alters the basis upon which the Index Price
is determined and reported (the date that the first of such events occurs
being herein called the " _Redetermination Date_ "), then the parties shall
promptly meet, following the request of either party, to negotiate in good
faith in or to agree upon an alternate publication for the purposes of
determining the Index Price. If the parties fail to agree on an alternative
price or reference publication within thirty (30) days of the _Redetermination
Date_ , then the Index Price will be determined with each party obtaining a
good faith quote from a leading, investment grade, non-affiliated dealer in
the relevant market and averaging the two quotes.

 



Conflicts. To the extent there are conflicts between this Transaction
Confirmation and the Base Contract, such conflicts will be resolved in favor
of this Transaction Confirmation.

 



Dodd Frank Trade Option Representations. To the extent this Transaction is a
commodity option (including a forward transaction with volumetric
optionality):
