                            ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of May 11, 2004 (the "Execution Date"), by and between HILLCREST
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, an Oklahoma not-for-profit corporation ("Seller"), and ARDENT
HEALTH SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").

                                  INTRODUCTION

         A. Seller is the parent of a multi-organization system of
organizations, each of which Seller, completely or partially, directly or
indirectly, owns or controls (i.e., possesses the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the entity whether through the
holding of membership interests, the ownership of voting securities, by contract
or otherwise), including, but not limited to, the organizations listed on Part A
of Exhibit A (individually, a "Seller Entity Organization" and collectively, the
"Seller Entity Organizations").

         B. Seller Entity Organizations include the organizations listed on Part
B of Exhibit A (individually, a "Seller Entity" and collectively, the "Seller
Entities") and on Part C of Exhibit A (individually, a "Seller Organization" and
collectively, the "Seller Organizations"), each of which is engaged directly or
indirectly in the business of delivering health care services to the public
and/or in activities directly or indirectly related thereto, including, without
limitation, the ownership and/or lease of assets and the employment and/or
engagement of personnel used in connection with the ownership and operation of
health care facilities and businesses.

         C. Seller Entities (a) are engaged directly or indirectly in the
business of delivering health care services and in businesses directly or
indirectly related thereto in metropolitan Tulsa, Oklahoma through (i) the
ownership and operation of the hospitals identified on Part A of Exhibit B
(individually, a "Metro Hospital" and collectively, the "Metro Hospitals") and
(ii) the ownership and operation of the health care businesses and activities
incident to the operation of the Metro Hospitals identified on Part B of Exhibit
B (individually, a "Metro Health Care Business" and collectively, the "Metro
Health Care Businesses") (the Metro Hospitals and the Metro Health Care
Businesses are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Metro
Facilities") and (b) are engaged directly or indirectly in the business of
delivering health care services and in businesses directly or indirectly related
thereto outside metropolitan Tulsa, Oklahoma in the Oklahoma communities of
Cushing, Bristow, Cleveland, Pawnee, Henryetta, Poteau and Wagoner through (i)
the operation of the hospitals identified on Part C of Exhibit B (individually,
a "Strategic Hospital" and collectively, the "Strategic Hospitals") and (ii) the
ownership and operation of the health care businesses and activities incident to
the operation of the Strategic Hospitals identified on Part D of Exhibit B
(individually, a "Strategic Health Care Business" and collectively, the
"Strategic Health Care Businesses") (the Strategic Hospitals and the Strategic
Health Care Businesses are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the
"Strategic Facilities" and the Metro Facilities and the Strategic Facilities are
referred to in this Agreement collectively as the "Facilities").

         D. Seller Organizations are engaged directly or indirectly in the
business of delivering health care services and in businesses directly or
indirectly related thereto outside metropolitan

                                       1

<PAGE>

Tulsa, Oklahoma in the Oklahoma communities of Fairfax, Coalgate and Prague
through (i) the operation of the hospitals identified on Part E of Exhibit B
(individually, an "Independent Hospital" and collectively, the "Independent
Hospitals") and (ii) the ownership and operation of the health care businesses
and activities incident to the operation of the Independent Hospitals identified
on Part F of Exhibit B (individually, an "Independent Health Care Business" and
collectively, the "Independent Health Care Businesses") (the Independent
Hospitals and the Independent Health Care Businesses are referred to in this
Agreement collectively as the "Independent Facilities").

         E. Buyer is the parent of a multi-organization system of organizations,
each of which Buyer, completely or partially, directly or indirectly, owns or
controls (i.e., possesses the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of the entity whether through the holding of membership
interests, the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise),
including, but not limited to, the organizations listed on Part A of Exhibit C
(individually, a "Buyer Entity Organization" and collectively, the "Buyer Entity
Organizations").

         F. Buyer Entity Organizations include the organizations listed on Part
B of Exhibit C (individually, a "Buyer Entity" and collectively, the "Buyer
Entities"), each of which will be engaged directly or indirectly in the business
of delivering health care services to the public and/or in activities directly
or indirectly related thereto following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

         G. On the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.1), Seller desires to
sell to Buyer and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller substantially all of the
assets of Seller and Seller Entities which are directly or indirectly related
to, necessary for, or used in connection with, the operation of the Facilities
(other than the Excluded Assets (as defined in Section 1.2)), and Buyer has
agreed to cause Buyer Entities to assume the Assumed Liabilities (as defined in
Section 1.3) for the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 1.5) and upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

         H. Further, on the Closing Date, as more fully described herein, Seller
and Seller Entity Organizations desire to cease to engage directly or indirectly
in the business of delivering health care services and in businesses directly or
indirectly related thereto.

         I. However, Seller and Seller Entities operate the Strategic
Facilities through and pursuant to agreements styled either as "operating
agreements" or "lease agreements" (individually, a "Strategic Facility
Agreement" and collectively, the "Strategic Facility Agreements"), none of which
appears to permit Seller or Seller Entities to assign in its entirety the
applicable agreement to an independent third party without first obtaining the
consent of all or some the other parties to the agreement, and none of which
appears to permit a for-profit entity to assume the position of the applicable
Seller Entity as the operator of the Strategic Facilities.

         J. Further, Seller and Seller Organizations operate the Independent
Facilities through and pursuant to agreements also styled as "operating
agreements" or "lease agreements" (individually, an "Independent Facility
Agreement" and collectively, the "Independent Facility Agreements"), several of
which do not permit Seller or Seller Organizations to unilaterally terminate the
subject agreement without cause.

                                       2

         K. Therefore, between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, and for
no additional consideration other than the Purchase Price, Seller and Buyer
shall jointly use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to
accomplish either of the following: (a) to cause the other parties to each
Strategic Facility Agreement (the "Strategic Parties") to reach, on or before
the Closing Date, an agreement, pursuant to which, on or before the Closing
Date, the Strategic Parties to each Strategic Facility Agreement will: (i) with
the consent of Seller and the applicable Seller Entity, terminate the Strategic
Facility Agreement between them and Seller and the applicable Seller Entity and
(ii) with the consent of the Buyer, enter into a new lease agreement in
substantially the form attached to Exhibit D between them and the applicable
Buyer Entity (the "Lease Agreement"), as modified as necessary to incorporate
the terms of the agreements between Buyer and Seller set forth herein, pursuant
to which the applicable Buyer Entity will replace the applicable Seller Entity
as the operator of the subject Strategic Facilities, under terms and conditions
substantially similar to the terms and conditions then in effect under the
terminated Strategic Facility Agreement, except to the extent otherwise agreed
to by Buyer and the Strategic Parties, and approved by Seller, and except to the
extent otherwise required by law, or (b) to cause the Strategic Parties to each
Strategic Facility Agreement to enter into, on or before the Closing Date, a
letter of intent between them and Buyer (a "Letter of Intent"), pursuant to
which the Strategic Parties to each Strategic Facility Agreement will agree to
take as promptly as is possible after the Closing Date, the following actions:
(a) with the consent of Seller and the applicable Seller Entity, terminate the
Strategic Facility Agreement between them and Seller and the applicable Seller
Entity and (b) enter into a Lease Agreement, as modified as necessary to
incorporate the terms of the agreements between Buyer and Seller set forth
herein, pursuant to which the applicable Buyer Entity will replace the
applicable Seller Entity as the operator of the subject Strategic Facilities,
under terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms and conditions
then in effect under the terminated Strategic Facility Agreement, except to the
extent otherwise agreed to by Buyer and the Strategic Parties, and approved by
Seller, and except to the extent otherwise required by law; with commercially
reasonable best efforts, as used in this Paragraph K, defined to include (i) the
agreement of Seller and Buyer to act cooperatively in a collaborative manner to
make all necessary and appropriate contacts with the Strategic Parties to each
Strategic Facility Agreement as may be required to cause them to enter into a
Lease Agreement or a Letter of Intent on or before the Closing Date and (ii) the
agreement of Seller and Buyer to assist the Strategic Parties to the Strategic
Facility Agreement relating to Cushing Regional Hospital to identify, develop
and implement strategies to convert the debt of Cushing Regional Hospital from
tax-exempt to taxable in order to enable the Strategic Parties to the Strategic
Facility Agreement relating to Cushing Regional Hospital to enter into a Lease
Agreement with a Buyer Entity on or before, or as soon as possible after, the
Closing Date.

         L. Further, between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, and for no
additional consideration other than the Purchase Price, Seller and the
applicable Seller Organization shall use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to reach an agreement with the other parties to each Independent
Facility Agreement (the "Independent Parties"), pursuant to which the
Independent Parties to each Independent Facility Agreement will agree to take as
promptly as possible before, on or after the Closing Date the following actions:
(a) with the consent of Seller and the applicable Seller Organization, terminate
the Independent Facility Agreement between them and Seller and the applicable
Seller Organization and (b) implement or pursue one or more alternative
strategies,

                                       3

including, but not limited to, converting their Independent Facilities to
independent, stand alone, facilities, selling their Independent Facilities to an
independent third party (including an independent third party introduced to them
by Seller), entering into a management agreement with an independent third party
(including an independent third party introduced to them by Seller) pursuant to
which the independent third party will manage the business and operations of
their Independent Facilities, or entering into an affiliation or other
collaborative arrangement with an independent third party (including an
independent third party introduced to them by Seller).

         M. On the Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, and for no additional consideration other than the Purchase
Price, Seller and Buyer shall take, and shall cause to be taken with respect to
each group of Strategic Parties that enters into a Lease Agreement on or prior
to the Closing Date, the same actions Buyer and Seller shall take hereunder
respecting the Metro Facilities (the intent of the parties being to treat said
Strategic Facilities and Metro Facilities the same), including, without
limitation, the following actions: (a) as more fully described in Section 10.11,
Seller shall, and shall cause Seller Entities to, terminate all of their
employees assigned to the Strategic Facilities who are not parties to written
employment agreements with Seller or Seller Entities, and Buyer shall cause the
applicable Buyer Entities to offer to hire all active employees of Seller and
Seller Entities assigned to the Strategic Facilities who are not parties to
written employment agreements; (b) as more fully described in Section 1.1,
Seller shall sell, convey, transfer and deliver, and shall cause Seller Entities
to sell, convey, transfer and deliver, to the applicable Buyer Entities, and
Buyer shall cause the applicable Buyer Entities to purchase, acquire and accept,
all of the right, title and interest of Seller and Seller Entities in the assets
owned and/or leased by Seller and Seller Entities and used in connection with
the operation of the Strategic Facilities as may exist on the Closing Date,
other than the Excluded Assets; (c) as more fully described in Section 1.2,
Seller and Seller Entities shall retain all of the rights, title and interest of
Seller and Seller Entities in and to the Excluded Assets; (d) as more fully
described in Section 1.3, Seller and Seller Entities shall assign to Buyer and
the applicable Buyer Entity, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the applicable
Buyer Entity to, assume and pay, perform, honor and discharge the Assumed
Liabilities; and (e) as more fully described in Section 1.4, Seller and Seller
Entities shall retain, and Buyer shall and Buyer Entities shall not assume, and
shall not be obligated to pay, the Excluded Liabilities.

         Further, on the Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and for no additional consideration other than the
Purchase Price, Seller and Buyer shall implement, and shall cause to be
implemented, with respect to each group of Strategic Parties that enters into a
Letter of Intent on or prior to the Closing Date, a transitional strategy
designed to provide each such group of Strategic Parties the time required to
enter into a Lease Agreement (or, as provided below, to pursue an alternative
strategy), which transitional strategy shall consist of the following
components: (a) on the Closing Date, Seller and the applicable Seller Entity
shall remain and continue to be parties to the applicable Strategic Facility
Agreement then in effect, the term of which shall continue until Buyer or Buyer
Entity enters into a Lease Agreement with the applicable Strategic Parties,
unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms or otherwise; (b) on the
Closing Date, Seller and/or the applicable Seller Entity and Buyer and/or the
applicable Buyer Entity shall enter into a "full services" management services
agreement in substantially the form attached to Exhibit E-1, as modified as
necessary to incorporate the terms of the agreements between Buyer and

                                       4

pertaining to fraud, environmental, health care regulatory and ERISA matters);

            (n) all liabilities and obligations relating to any oral agreements,
oral contracts or oral understandings with any referral sources including, but
not limited to, physicians, unless reduced to writing and assumed as part of the
Assumed Contracts; and

            (o) any liability arising solely out of the act of assignment of any
of the Contracts by Seller or Seller Entities to Buyer Entities at the Closing.

      1.5. PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the
Purchased Assets shall be Two Hundred Eighty One Million Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($281,200,000) plus the amount of Net Working Capital (as defined in
Section 1.6(a)), and minus the amount of any long-term debt and capitalized
leases in respect of the Facilities that are assumed by the Buyer Entities and
set forth on Schedule 1.3(b). The parties shall calculate the estimated Net
Working Capital (as determined in accordance with Schedule 1.6) as of the
Closing. The parties shall adjust the Net Working Capital after the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.6 to reflect the actual Net Working Capital (as
determined in accordance with Section 1.6(b)). In addition, the Buyer Entities
shall assume the Assumed Liabilities. The parties shall not adjust the Purchase
Price for any other reason, except as specifically provided for in Section
10.25. Net Working Capital shall not include the Net Working Capital of the
Strategic Facilities, unless a Lease Agreement is entered into on or before the
Closing Date. The Purchase Price shall be due and payable to Seller at Closing
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by
Seller to Buyer in writing.

      1.6. NET WORKING CAPITAL, ESTIMATES AND AUDITS.

            (a) NET WORKING CAPITAL. As used herein, the term "Net Working
Capital" shall mean the aggregate current assets of Seller and Seller Entities
conveyed to the Buyer Entities pursuant to Section 1.1 (excluding those Excluded
Assets which would otherwise be included in current assets), minus the aggregate
current liabilities of Seller and Seller Entities assumed by the Buyer Entities
pursuant to Section 1.3 (excluding those Excluded Liabilities which would
otherwise be included in current liabilities), all as determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting

                                       16

<PAGE>

principles ("GAAP"). Schedule 1.6(a) contains a computation of Net Working
Capital as of January 31, 2004 and the principles, specifications and
methodologies the parties shall use to determine Net Working Capital.

            (b) ESTIMATES AND ADJUSTMENTS. At least ten (10) business days prior
to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement containing its estimate of
Net Working Capital as of the end of the most recently ended calendar month
prior to the Closing Date for which financial statements of Seller and Seller
Entity Organizations are available and containing reasonable detail and
supporting documents showing the derivation of such estimate. Subject to the
mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer, the estimated Net Working Capital together
with the principles, specifications and methodologies used to determine the
estimated Net Working Capital as specified in Schedule 1.6(a), shall be used for
purposes of calculating the Purchase Price as of the Closing. Within ninety (90)
days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller its determination of the
Net Working Capital as of the Closing (following the same principles,
specifications and methodologies used to determine the estimated Net Working
Capital as set forth on Schedule 1.6(a)). Each party shall have full, complete
and equal access to the financial books and records pertaining to the Purchased
Assets, including the Facilities, to confirm or audit Net Working Capital
computations. Should Seller disagree with Buyer's determination of Net Working
Capital, Seller shall give Buyer written notice of its disagreement within sixty
(60) days after Buyer's delivery of its determination of Net Working Capital. If
Seller and Buyer fail to agree within thirty (30) days after Seller's delivery
of its notice of disagreement on the amount of Net Working Capital, they shall
resolve their disagreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 1.6(c) which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving
disputes relative to the determination of Net Working Capital. Upon the
resolution of their disagreement, the parties shall increase or decrease the
Purchase Price based on Net Working Capital as of the Closing, and within five
(5) business days after determination thereof (the "Post-Closing Adjustment
Date"), Buyer shall pay to Seller any increase in cash, and Seller shall pay to
Buyer any decrease in cash. If Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, fails to
make such payment to the other by the Post-Closing Adjustment Date, then the
party failing to receive such amount due to it shall be entitled to receive
interest on such unpaid amount at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate
reported by The Wall Street Journal under "Money Rates" on the Post-Closing
Adjustment Date, plus two percent (2%) (or the maximum rate allowed by law,
whichever is less) from the defaulting party, such interest accruing on each
calendar day after the Post-Closing Adjustment Date until payment of such amount
and all interest thereon is made.

            (c) DISPUTE OF ADJUSTMENTS. If Seller and Buyer are not able to
agree on the Net Working Capital within thirty (30) days after Seller's delivery
of notice of disagreement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer each shall have the right
to submit the disputed determination to Deloitte & Touche LLP or if Deloitte &
Touche LLP is not available for any reason or does not maintain its independent
status, such other independent certified public accounting firm as Seller and
Buyer may then mutually agree upon in writing (the "Accounting Firm") for
computation or verification in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The Accounting Firm shall review the matters in dispute and, acting as experts
and not as arbitrators, shall promptly decide the proper amounts of the disputed
entries (which decision shall also include a final calculation of Net Working
Capital). The submission of the disputed matter to the Accounting Firm shall be
the exclusive remedy for resolving accounting disputes relative to the
determination of Net Working Capital. The Accounting Firm's

                                       17
<PAGE>

determination shall be binding upon Seller (and Seller Entity Organizations) and
Buyer (and Buyer Entity Organizations). If all or a portion of the dispute at
issue involves a legal issue or an interpretation of this Agreement, such legal
or interpretative dispute shall first be subject to adjudication by a court or
similar tribunal, with any necessary review by the Accounting Firm under this
Section 1.6 occurring following the resolution of such legal dispute. Seller and
Buyer shall bear equally the Accounting Firm's fees and expenses.

            (d) PHYSICAL INVENTORY. If requested by Buyer at least twenty (20)
days prior to Closing, Seller shall cause a physical inventory to be taken of
all inventory and supplies on hand at the Facilities by either (i) employees or
representatives of Seller or Seller Entities or (ii) an independent third party
selected by Seller, the cost of which independent third party shall be borne by
Seller, as near in time as possible to the Closing Date and with the results
extended and adjusted through the Closing Date. Seller shall have sole
discretion as to whether employees or representatives of Seller or an
independent third party are used to conduct such physical inventory. Seller
shall permit representatives or employees of Buyer to observe such inventory
process. For purposes of determining the Net Working Capital, inventory shall be
valued as determined pursuant to this Section 1.6(d) if a physical inventory has
been requested by Buyer.

      1.7. PRORATIONS. Except as otherwise provided herein or as settled at
Closing, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
prorate as of the Closing Date any amounts which are attributable to the periods
prior to, and on and following the Closing Date and which become due and payable
after the Closing Date with respect to (i) the Assumed Contracts, (ii) ad
valorem taxes, if any, on the Owned Real Property, (iii) property taxes on the
Purchased Assets and (iv) all utilities servicing any of the Purchased Assets,
including water, sewer, telephone, electricity and gas service. Any such amounts
which are not available within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date shall be
similarly prorated as soon as practicable thereafter.

Entities are in default under any order of any court or federal, state,

amended ("RCRA") and (iii) neither Seller nor any Seller Entity has received any
written notice alleging or asserting either a material violation of any
Environmental Law or asserting a material obligation on the part of Seller or a

Environmental Law. No Hazardous Substances (which for purposes of this Section
3.15 shall mean and include polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos, and any
substances, materials, constituents, wastes, or other elements which are
included under or regulated by any Environmental Law, including, without
limitation, CERCLA and RCRA) have been, and through the Closing Date will be,
disposed of on or released or discharged from or onto, or, to the best knowledge
of Seller, threatened to be released from or onto, the Real Property (including
groundwater) by Seller or Seller Entities, or to the best knowledge of Seller,
any third party, in material violation of any Environmental Law. Neither Seller
nor any Seller Entity, nor to the best knowledge of Seller, any prior owners,
operators or occupants of the Real Property, have allowed any Hazardous
Substances to be discharged, possessed, managed, processed, released, or
otherwise handled on the Real Property in a manner which is in violation of any
Environmental Law in any material respect, and Seller and Seller Entities have
complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to any
part of the Real Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15, to the best
knowledge of Seller, the improvements located on the Owned Real Property do not
contain friable asbestos. Without in any way limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the best of knowledge of Seller: (i) all current or former

in Seller's possession relating to the capacity, uses, dates of installation and
contents of such tanks located on the Owned Real Property are identified in
Schedule 3.15; (ii) there are no, nor have there ever been, any collection
dumps, pits, and disposal facilities or surface impoundments located on the

                                       29

<PAGE>

underground storage tanks have been maintained in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws. Seller does not warrant and, except as specifically provided
in this Section 3.15, makes no representation concerning the environmental
condition of the Owned Real Property or the presence of Hazardous Substances on,
under or about the Owned Real Property or adjoining properties.

      3.16. HILL-BURTON AND OTHER LIENS. The transactions contemplated hereby
and the sale of the Purchased Assets, including the Facilities (other than the
Excluded Assets) to Buyer or Buyer Entities will not result in any obligation of
Buyer or Buyer Entities to repay any loans, grants or loan guarantees pursuant
to the Hill-Burton Act program, the Health Professions Educational Assistance
Act, the Nurse Training Act, the National Health Planning and Resources
Development Act, and the Community Mental Health Centers Act, each as amended,
or similar laws or acts relating to health care facilities, nor subject Buyer,
Buyer Entities or the Purchased Assets to any lien, restriction or obligation,
including any requirement to provide uncompensated care.

      3.17. TAXES.

            (a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.17(a), Seller and Seller
Entities have filed on a timely basis, or validly extended the time for filing,
all federal, state and local tax returns (including income, payroll, employment,
withholding, information, excise, sales, real and personal property, use and
occupancy, business and occupation, gross receipts, mercantile, real estate,
capital stock and franchise or other taxes) required to be filed by them within
the past three (3) years (collectively, the "Tax Returns"). All Tax Returns are
true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect in all material
respects the tax liabilities of Seller and Seller Entities. All amounts shown
due on the Tax Returns have been or will be paid on a timely basis (including
any interest or penalties and amounts due state unemployment authorities) to the
appropriate tax authorities.

            (b) Seller and Seller Entities have withheld in all material
respects proper and accurate amounts from their employees' compensation in
compliance with all withholding and similar provisions of the Code, including
employee withholding and social security taxes, and any and all other applicable
laws. All such amounts have been duly and validly remitted to the proper taxing
authority.

            (c) No deficiencies for any of such taxes have been asserted within
the past three (3) years in writing to Seller or Seller Entities or, to the best
knowledge of Seller, threatened, and no audit on any such returns is currently
under way or, to the best knowledge of Seller, threatened. There are no
outstanding agreements by Seller or Seller Entities for the extension of time
for the assessment of any such taxes. Except as otherwise disclosed on Schedule
3.17(c), neither Seller nor Seller Entities have taken any action in respect of
any federal, state or local taxes (including, without limitation, any
withholdings required to be made in respect of employees) which may have a
material adverse impact upon the Purchased Assets, including the Facilities
(other than the Excluded Assets) as of or subsequent to Closing.

            (d) Neither Seller nor Seller Entities have received written notice
of tax liens on any of the Purchased Assets. To the best knowledge of Seller, no
basis exists for the imposition of any such liens other than liens for taxes not
yet delinquent.

in Schedule 1.1(h) or in Schedule 3.20(a), Seller has made available to Buyer
true and correct copies of the Assumed Contracts. Seller represents and warrants
with respect to the Assumed Contracts that:

            (a) Except as expressly set forth on Schedule 3.20(a), the Assumed
Contracts constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Seller or Seller
Entities and are enforceable against Seller or Seller Entities in accordance
with their terms;

            (b) Each Assumed Contract constitutes the entire agreement by and
between the respective parties thereto with respect to the subject matter
thereof, except as the Assumed Contract may otherwise state;

            (c) Except as expressly set forth on Schedule 3.20 (c), all
obligations required to be performed by Seller or Seller Entities under the
terms of the Assumed Contracts have been performed in all material respects, no
act or omission by Seller or Seller Entities has occurred or failed to occur
which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both would reasonably
constitute a material default under the Assumed Contracts, and each Assumed
Contract is now in full force and effect;

            (d) Except as expressly set forth on Schedule 3.20(d), none of the
Assumed Contracts requires consent to the assignment and assumption of such
Assumed Contracts by Buyer Entities, and Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any required consents prior to the Closing; and

            (e) Except as expressly set forth on Schedule 3.20(e), the
assignment of the Assumed Contracts to and assumption of such Assumed Contracts
by Buyer Entities will not result in any penalty or premium, or variation of the
rights, remedies, benefits or obligations of any party thereunder.

      3.21. SUPPLIES. Substantially all of the inventory and supplies
constituting any part of the Purchased Assets are of a quality and quantity
usable and salable in the ordinary course of business of the Facilities. Other
than obsolete items reflected in reserves in the Financial Statements, inventory
and supplies are carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in,
first-out basis and are properly accounted for in the Financial Statements. The
inventory levels are based on past practices of Seller or Seller Entities at the
Facilities.

      3.22. INSURANCE. Schedule 3.22 is an accurate schedule of the insurance
policies or self-insurance funds maintained by Seller and Seller Entities as of
the Execution Date covering the

<PAGE>

ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets, including the Facilities (other
than the Excluded Assets), indicating the types of insurance, policy numbers,
identity of insurers, amounts, and coverage. All of such policies are in full
force and effect with no premium arrearage. Seller and Seller Entities have
given in a timely manner to their insurers all notices required to be given
under their insurance policies within the past three (3) years, covering the
ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets, including the Facilities (other
than the Excluded Assets), with respect to all material claims and actions
covered by such insurance. No insurer has denied coverage of any such claims or
actions. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.22, during the last three (3) years,
Seller and Seller Entities have not (a) received any written notice from any
such insurance company canceling or materially amending any of such insurance
policies (other than upon the express request of Seller or one or more of the
Seller Entities to do so), and, to the best knowledge of Seller, no such
cancellation or amendment is threatened or (b) failed to give any required
written notice or present any claim which is still outstanding under any of such
policies with respect to the Purchased Assets, including the Facilities (other
than the Excluded Assets).

      3.23. THIRD PARTY PAYOR COST REPORTS. Seller and Seller Entities have duly
filed all required cost reports for their fiscal years ended June 30, 2001, June
30, 2002 and June 30, 2003. Such cost reports accurately reflect in all material
respects the information required to be included thereon and such cost reports
do not claim and neither the Facilities nor Seller or Seller Entities have
received reimbursement in any amount in excess of the amounts provided by law or
any applicable agreement, except where excess reimbursement was noted on such
cost report. Schedule 3.23 identifies such cost reports that have not been
audited and finally settled and a brief description of any and all notices of
program reimbursement, proposed or pending audit adjustments, disallowances,
appeals of disallowances, and any and all other unresolved claims or disputes in
respect of such cost reports. Seller and Seller Entities have established
adequate reserves to cover any known, historically identified or reasonably
expected obligations that Seller and Seller Entities may have in respect of any
such third party cost reports, and such reserves are reflected in the Financial
Statements.

      3.24. MEDICAL STAFF MATTERS. Seller has provided to Buyer true, correct,
and complete copies of the bylaws and rules and regulations of the medical staff

Schedule 3.24, during the time in which Seller or Seller Entity has operated the
Hospital (but in no event prior to three (3) years from the Execution Date)
there have been no adverse actions (as such term is defined in the bylaws and
rules and regulations of the medical staff of the applicable Hospital) with
respect to any medical staff members of the Hospitals or any applicant thereto
for which a medical staff member or applicant has requested a judicial review
hearing which has not been scheduled or has been scheduled but has not been
completed, and there are no pending or, to the best knowledge of Seller,
threatened disputes which have been conveyed in writing to the Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Medical Officer of the applicable
Hospital with applicants or staff members, and Seller knows of no basis
therefor, and all appeal periods in respect of any medical staff member or
applicant against whom an adverse action has been taken have expired.

      3.25. CONDITION OF ASSETS. The Purchased Assets and the Excluded Assets
constitute all assets which are held or used by Seller and Seller Entity
Organizations and necessary for the conduct of the business and operation of the
Facilities in the manner conducted as of the Execution Date. To the best
knowledge of Seller, except as set forth on Schedule 3.25, all buildings,
facilities and major equipment included in the Purchased Assets are free from
material defects and in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and are usable in the regular and ordinary course of business,

Seller, Schedule 3.26 lists and briefly describes all trademarks, service marks,
trade names, patents, copyrights, inventions, processes and applications
therefor (whether registered or common law) currently owned by Seller and Seller
Entities and used in connection with the Purchased Assets (collectively, the
"Intellectual Property"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.26, to the best
knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor Seller Entities have received written
notice that any proceedings have been instituted or are pending which challenge
the validity of the ownership by Seller or Seller Entities of the Intellectual
Property. Neither Seller nor Seller Entities have licensed anyone to use the
Intellectual Property and Seller has no knowledge of the use or the infringement
of the Intellectual Property by any other person. To the best knowledge of
Seller, Seller and/or Seller Entities own (or possess enforceable licenses or
other rights to use) all Intellectual Property. Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.26, to the best knowledge of Seller, Seller and/or Seller Entities own (or
possess enforceable licenses or other rights to use) all computer software
programs and similar systems used in the conduct of their business.

the Purchased Assets represent and constitute bona fide indebtedness owing to
Seller and Seller Entities for services actually performed or for goods or
supplies actually provided in the amounts indicated on the Financial Statements
with no known set-offs, deductions, compromises, or reductions (other than
reasonable allowances for bad debt and contractual allowances in an amount
consistent with historical policies and procedures of Seller and Seller Entities
and which are taken into consideration in the preparation of the Financial

"not yet due and payable." The Title Policy shall be issued on an ALTA Form 1992
Owner's Title Policy in an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price

8. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the obligations of Seller to consummate the transactions

Date, of the following conditions precedent unless (but only to the extent)
waived in writing by Seller at the Closing:

      8.1. REPRESENTATIONS/WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement shall be true in all material respects when
made and, when read in light of any Schedules which have been attached to this

and as of such Closing Date. Each and all of the terms, covenants, and
conditions of this Agreement to be complied with or performed by Buyer on or

      8.2. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. Seller or Seller Entities shall not have

      8.3. ACTIONS/PROCEEDINGS. No action or proceeding shall have been

from counsel to Buyer dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to Seller, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Seller, covering the
matters set forth in Exhibit O.

9. SELLER'S COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. Seller hereby covenants that at all times
from the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, except as a
consultant or contractor to or of Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer), or except
as provided in the Introduction, own, lease, manage, operate, control, or
participate in any manner with the ownership, lease, management, operation or
control of any business which offers

                                       47

<PAGE>

health care services in competition with the Facilities, including, but not
limited to, any acute care hospital, specialty hospital, rehabilitation
facility, diagnostic imaging center, inpatient or outpatient psychiatric or
substance abuse facility, ambulatory or other type of surgery center, nursing
home, skilled nursing facility, home health or hospice agency, or physician
clinic or physician medical practice (any of such uses being referred to herein
as a "Competing Business"), within a ten-mile radius of the location of each
Hospital as of the Execution Date (the "Restricted Area"), without Buyer's prior
written consent (which Buyer may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion);
provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates will not be precluded from
participating in activities which promote health care services for residents of
the communities historically served by Seller or its Affiliates, so long as
Seller or its Affiliate does not make direct monetary payment to a Competing
Business within the Restricted Area (other than to Strategic Health Care
Businesses if and for so long as the same are the subject and included within a
Strategic Facility Agreement and other than to Independent Health Care
Businesses if and for so long as the same are the subject and included within a
Independent Facility Agreement); provided further, however, that Seller and its
Affiliates will not be precluded from making direct monetary payments to a
Competing Business within the Restricted Area if the Hospital (the location of
which defines the Restricted Area) ceases to be owned or operated by Buyer or
its Affiliates; provided, further, however, that Seller and its Affiliates will
not be precluded from making direct monetary payments to a Competing Business
within the Restricted Area to support the Competing Business' provision of
health care to the medically underserved, to support the Competing Business'
conduct and undertaking of medical education, and/or to support the Competing
Business' sponsorship of medical research. In the event of a breach of this
Section 9, Seller recognizes that monetary damages shall be inadequate to
compensate Buyer and Buyer shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond or
similar security, to an injunction restraining such breach, with the costs
(including attorneys' fees) of securing such injunction to be borne by Seller.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing
any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach. Each
party hereto hereby acknowledges the necessity of protection against the
competition of Seller and its Affiliates and that the nature and scope of such
protection has been carefully considered by the parties. Seller further
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and provisions of this Section 9 form
part of the consideration under this Agreement and are among the inducements for
Buyer entering into and consummating the transactions contemplated herein. The
period provided and the area covered are expressly represented and agreed to be
fair, reasonable and necessary. The consideration provided for herein is deemed
to be sufficient and adequate to compensate for agreeing to the restrictions
contained in this Section 9. If, however, any court determines that the
foregoing restrictions are not reasonable, such restrictions shall be modified,
rewritten or interpreted to include as much of their nature and scope as will
render them enforceable.

10. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

      10.1. ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among Seller and Seller Entities and classes of Purchased Assets in accordance
with and as provided by Section 1060 of the Code. Within thirty (30) days prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with a preliminary allocation of the
Purchase Price for Seller's review and approval, which approval Seller shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Buyer
shall provide Seller with a revised allocation of the Purchase Price for
Seller's review and approval, which

                                       48

<PAGE>

approval Seller shall not unreasonably withhold or delay. The parties agree that
any tax returns or other tax information that they may file or cause to be filed
with any governmental agency shall be prepared and filed consistently with such
agreed upon allocation. In this regard, the parties agree that, to the extent
required, they will each properly prepare and timely file Form 8594 in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code.

      10.2. TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING.

            (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement
may be terminated at any time: (i) on or prior to the Closing Date by mutual
consent of Seller and Buyer; (ii) by Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 7
have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of any
condition in Section 7 is or becomes impossible and Buyer has not waived such
condition in writing on or before the Closing Date (provided that the failure to
satisfy the applicable condition or conditions has occurred by reason other than
(a) through the failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement or (b) Seller's failure to provide its closing deliveries on the
Closing Date is a result of Buyer not being ready, willing and able to close the
transaction on the Closing Date); (iii) by Seller if any of the conditions in
Section 8 have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of
any such condition in Section 8 is or becomes impossible and Seller has not
waived such condition in writing on or before the Closing Date (provided that
the failure to satisfy the applicable condition or conditions has occurred by
reason other than (a) through the failure of Seller to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement or (b) Buyer's failure to provide its closing
deliveries on the Closing Date is a result of Seller not being ready, willing
and able to close the transaction on the Closing Date); (iv) by Buyer or Seller
if the Closing Date shall not have taken place by August 31, 2004 (which date
may be extended to September 30, 2004 by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller if
they believe that the Closing is imminent); or (v) by either Seller or Buyer
pursuant to Section 12.1.

            (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.2(a), (a)
all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate,
except that the obligations in Sections 12.6, 12.9, 12.10, and 12.11 shall
survive, (b) each party shall pay the costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement, except as provided in Section 12.9, and (c)
nothing shall prevent either party hereto from pursing any of its legal rights
or remedies that may be granted to any such party by law against the other party
to this Agreement.

      10.3. POST CLOSING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. Seller and Buyer acknowledge
that subsequent to Closing each party may need access to information or
documents in the control or possession of the other party for the purposes of
concluding the transactions herein contemplated, audits, compliance with
governmental regulations, the prosecution or defense of third party or other
claims and for other reasonable and legitimate business purposes. Accordingly,
Seller and Buyer agree that for a period of six (6) years after Closing, or
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(if the information or documents relate to a patient not of majority age when
treated), whichever is longer, each will make available to the other's agents,
independent auditors and counsel within ten (10) days after receipt of the other
party's written request and at the expense of the requesting party such
documents and information as may be available relating to the Purchased Assets
for periods prior and subsequent to Closing to the extent necessary to
facilitate concluding the

                                       49

<PAGE>

transactions herein contemplated, audits, compliance with governmental
regulations, the prosecution or defense of claims and other reasonable and
legitimate business purposes.

      10.4. PRESERVATION AND ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER THE CLOSING. After the
Closing, Buyer shall, in the ordinary course of business and for no less than
the period required by law, keep and preserve in their original form all medical
and other records of the Facilities existing as of the Closing, and which
constitute a part of the Purchased Assets delivered to the Buyer Entities at the
Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "records" includes all
documents, electronic data and other compilations of information in any form.
Buyer acknowledges that as a result of entering into this Agreement and
operating the Facilities it and Buyer Entities will gain access to patient and
other information which is subject to rules and regulations regarding
confidentiality. Buyer agrees to abide by, and to cause Buyer Entities to abide
by, any such rules and regulations relating to the confidential information it
or they acquire. Buyer further agrees to maintain, and to cause Buyer Entities
to maintain, the patient records delivered to Buyer Entities at the Closing at
the Facilities after Closing in accordance with applicable law (including, if
applicable, Section 1861(v)(i)(I) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
Section 1395(v)(l)(i)), the privacy requirements of HIPAA and applicable state
requirements with respect to medical privacy and requirements of relevant
insurance carriers, all in a manner consistent with the maintenance of patient
records generated at the Facilities after Closing to the extent such maintenance
rules are consistent with applicable laws. No later than ten (10) days after
Buyer's receipt of written notice from Seller or Seller Entity Organization and
appropriate consents and authorizations, Buyer will afford, during normal
business hours, to the representatives of Seller, including its counsel and
accountants, full and complete access to, and copies of, the records transferred
to Buyer and Buyer Entities at the Closing (including, without limitation,
access to patient records in respect of patients treated by Seller Entities at
the Facilities). No later than ten (10) days after Buyer's receipt of written
notice, Buyer shall also make available to Seller and Seller Entity
Organizations at their sole cost and expense, the officers and employees of
Buyer Entities at reasonable times and places after the Closing. In addition,
Seller and Seller Entities shall be entitled, at their sole risk, to remove from
the Facilities copies of any such patient records, but only for legitimate
business purposes, including a governmental investigation or pending litigation
involving a patient to whom such records refer, as certified in writing prior to
removal by counsel retained by Seller or Seller Entities in connection with such
business purpose and, if required by law, also upon Buyer's receipt of
appropriate consents and authorizations. Seller or Seller Entities shall
promptly following their use return to Buyer or Buyer Entity any patient records
they may remove from the Facilities. Any access to the Facilities, their records
or the Buyer Entities' personnel granted to Seller in this Agreement shall be
upon the condition that any such access not materially interfere with the
business operations of Buyer Entities.

      10.5. CON DISCLAIMER. This Agreement shall not be deemed to be an
acquisition or obligation of a capital expenditure or of funds within the
meaning of the certificate of need statute of any state, until the appropriate
governmental agencies shall have granted a certificate of need or the
appropriate approval or ruled that no certificate of need or other approval is
required.

      10.6. TAX AND MEDICARE EFFECT. None of the parties (nor such parties'
counsel or accountants) has made or is making any representations to the other
party (nor such party's counsel or accountants) concerning any of the tax or
Medicare effects of the transactions provided for in this

                                       50

<PAGE>

Agreement as each party hereto represents that each has obtained, or may obtain,
independent tax and Medicare advice with respect thereto and upon which it, if
so obtained, has solely relied.

      10.7. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS. This Agreement and all documents relating
hereto, including, without limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications
which may hereafter be executed, (b) the documents delivered at the Closing, and
(c) financial statements, certificates and other information previously or
hereafter furnished to Seller or to Buyer, may, subject to the provisions of
Section 12.10, be reproduced by Seller and by Buyer by any photographic,
photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic or other similar
process. Seller and Buyer agree and stipulate that any such reproduction shall
be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial, arbitral or
administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and
whether or not such reproduction was made by Seller or Buyer in the regular
course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction
of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

      10.8. COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.

            (a) Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate fully with
each other and shall make available to each other, as reasonably requested and
at the expense of the requesting party, and to any taxing authority, as
reasonably requested and at the expense of the requesting party, all
information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax
liabilities of Seller for all periods on or prior to the Closing and any
information which may be relevant to determining the amount payable under this
Agreement, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents (to
the extent a part of the Purchased Assets delivered to the Buyer Entities at
Closing) at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations
or extensions thereof.

            (b) Buyer and Seller agree to follow the standard procedure for
preparing and filing specified employer tax returns and employee information
returns as established in Revenue Procedure 96-60, modifying and superceding
84-77. Seller agrees to make any and all necessary information in its possession
or under its control available to Buyer with respect to predecessor wages
considered as having been paid by the successor under Section 3121(a)(1) for
purposes of determining whether the successor employer has paid remuneration
with respect to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under section
230 of the Social Security Act).

            (c) Buyer and Seller agree to follow the standard procedure for
preparing and filing information returns as established by Revenue Procedure
99-50.

      10.9. COST REPORTS. Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare
and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all terminating and
other cost reports required or permitted by law to be filed under the Medicare
and Medicaid or other third party payor programs and the State Health Agency for
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or as a result of the
consummation of the transactions described herein (the "Seller Cost Reports").
Seller shall submit to Buyer for Buyer's review and approval (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the terminating Seller Cost Report
relating to each Facility, at least ten (10) business days prior to the intended
filing date of such terminating Seller Cost Report. Buyer shall give to Seller
its comments

                                       51

<PAGE>

to the Seller Cost Reports within five (5) business days after its receipt of
the same. Buyer shall forward, and shall cause Buyer Entities to forward, to
Seller any and all correspondence relating to the Seller Cost Reports within
five (5) business days after receipt by Buyer or Buyer Entities. Buyer shall
remit any receipts of funds relating to the Seller Cost Reports within ten (10)
business days after receipt by Buyer or Buyer Entities and shall forward to
Seller any demand for payments within three (3) business days after receipt by
Buyer. Seller shall retain all rights to the Seller Cost Reports including any
amounts receivable or payable in respect of such reports or reserves relating to
such reports. Such rights shall include the right to appeal any Medicare or
Medicaid determinations relating to the Seller Cost Reports. Seller shall retain
the originals of the Seller Cost Reports, correspondence, work papers and other
documents relating to the Seller Cost Reports. Seller will furnish copies of
such cost reports, correspondence, work papers and other documents relating to
the Seller Cost Reports to Buyer upon Buyer's written request and at Buyer's
cost.

      10.10. MISDIRECTED PAYMENTS, ETC. Seller and Buyer each covenants and
agrees to remit, with reasonable promptness (but no later than ten (10) business
days after its receipt), to the other any payments received, which payments are
on or in respect of accounts or notes receivable owned by (or are otherwise
payable to) the other. In addition, and without limitation, in the event of a
determination by any governmental or third-party payor that payments to Seller
Entities or the Facilities resulted in an overpayment or other determination
that funds previously paid by any program or plan to Seller Entities or the
Facilities must be repaid, Seller shall be responsible for repayment of said
monies (or defense of such actions) if such overpayment or other repayment
determination was for services rendered prior to the Closing Date and Buyer
shall be responsible for repayment of said monies (or defense of such actions)
if such overpayment or other repayment determination was for services rendered
on or after the Closing Date. In the event that, following the Closing, Buyer
suffers any offsets against reimbursement under any third-party payor or
reimbursement programs due to Buyer, relating directly to amounts owing under
any such programs by Seller or any Seller Entity Organization, Seller shall
promptly upon demand from Buyer pay to Buyer the amounts so billed or offset
after Seller determines to its reasonable satisfaction that the offsets suffered
by Buyer relate directly to amounts owed by Seller or Seller Entities under any
such programs; conversely, in the event that following the Closing, Seller
suffers any offsets against reimbursement under any third-party payor or
reimbursement programs due to Seller, relating directly to amounts owing under
any such programs by Buyer or Buyer Entities, Buyer shall promptly upon demand
from Seller pay to Seller the amounts so billed or offset after Seller
determines to its reasonable satisfaction that the offsets suffered by Seller
relate directly to amounts owed by Buyer or Buyer Entities under any such
programs.

      10.11. EMPLOYEE MATTERS. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Seller Entities to, terminate all of their employees who are not
parties to written employment agreements with Seller or Seller Entities, and
Buyer shall cause the Buyer Entities to offer to hire all active employees of
Seller and Seller Entities who are not parties to written employment agreements
with Seller or Seller Entities (including those employees then on approved FMLA
leaves of absence, leaves for workers' compensation of up to 12 weeks, or leaves
of absence that do not extend beyond thirty (30) days) as of the Closing Date in
positions equivalent to and at compensation levels consistent with those
maintained or provided by Seller and Seller Entities immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer reserves the right to permit
a Buyer Entity not

                                       52

<PAGE>

to hire any individual employee for cause (i.e., with a legitimate and legally
permissible reason with respect to such employee's job performance or conduct),
upon reasonable advance written notice to Seller and the employee (but no later
than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date). Other than the
obligation stated herein to offer to hire all active employees on the terms and
conditions stated herein, and the obligation to comply with the requirements of
the WARN Act, nothing herein shall be deemed to affect or limit in any way
normal management prerogatives of Buyer with respect to employees or to create
or grant to any such employees third party beneficiary rights or claims of any
kind or nature. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
within the period of ninety (90) days before the Closing, Seller and Seller
Entities shall not, and within the ninety (90) days following the Closing, Buyer
and Buyer Entities shall not: (1) permanently or temporarily shut down a single
site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within a single
site of employment, if the shutdown results in an employment loss during any
thirty (30) day period at the single site of employment for fifty (50) or more
employees, excluding any part-time employees; or (2) have a mass layoff at a
single site of employment of at least thirty-three percent (33%) of the active
employees and at least fifty (50) employees, excluding part-time employees. The
terms "single site of employment," "operating unit," "employment loss" and "mass
layoff" shall be defined as in the WARN Act. With respect to terminations of or
a refusal to rehire employees following the Closing, Buyer Entities shall be
responsible for any notification required under the WARN Act. In respect of the
employees employed by Buyer Entities, Buyer Entities shall provide such
employees with employee benefits consistent with the benefits generally offered
to employees of Affiliates of Buyer in the same or comparable geographic area in
which the Facilities are located and, to the extent Seller and Seller Entities
have qualified retirement programs for such employees, Buyer and Buyer Entities
shall recognize the existing seniority of all such employees for benefits
purposes and shall provide credit under such plans for purposes of determining
eligibility and vesting and the rate of benefit accrual (but not actual benefit
accrual); provided, however, no such credit need be given in respect of any new
plan commenced or participated in by Buyer Entities in which no prior service
credit is given or recognized to or for other plan beneficiaries. In extending
such benefits, Buyer and Buyer Entities shall waive pre-existing conditions
limitations in their welfare benefit plans which might otherwise apply to such
employees except to the extent employees have not satisfied such limitations
under the current welfare benefit plans of Seller and Seller Entities.

      10.12. GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT. For a period of at least five (5) years
following the Closing, Buyer Entities will appoint a Board of Trustees for each
Hospital (the "Board of Trustees") comprised of the Hospital's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief of the Medical Staff, physicians on the Hospital's medical staff
and local community members. A majority of the members of the Board of Trustees
shall consist of individuals who are not employees of Buyer or Buyer Entity
Organizations. The Board of Trustees shall meet on a regular basis and, as more
fully set forth in the Hospital's bylaws, shall have the following
responsibilities:

            (a) adopting a vision, mission and values statement;

            (b) participating in development and review of operating and capital
budgets and facility planning (Buyer reserving ultimate authority for budgets
and planning);

                                       53

<PAGE>

            (c) participating in periodic (but no less frequently than annual)
evaluations of the Chief Executive Officer of the Hospital;

            (d) discontinuing, or substantially reducing in size or scope, an
essential service of the Hospital;

            (e) granting medical staff membership and privileges and, when
necessary, taking disciplinary action consistent with the Hospital and Medical
Staff Bylaws (with the advice of counsel);

            (f) assuring medical staff compliance with JCAHO or AOA requirements
(with the advice of counsel);

            (g) supporting physician recruitment efforts; and

            (h) fostering community relations and identifying service and
educational opportunities.

      10.13. INDIGENT CARE POLICIES. For a period of at least five (5) years
following the Closing, Buyer Entities shall adopt and maintain as the indigent
care policies of the Hospitals, Seller's or Seller Entities' current or proposed
indigent care policies for the Hospitals (or new policies that are intended to
provide a similar or greater benefit to the community). Seller's or Seller
Entities' current or proposed indigent care policies for the Hospitals are
attached as Exhibit P. Buyer Entities shall cause each Hospital to treat any
patient presented to the emergency room who has a medical emergency or who, in
the judgment of a staff physician, has an immediate emergency need. No such
patient will be turned away because of age, race, gender or inability to pay.
Buyer Entities shall cause the Hospitals to continue to participate in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. This covenant shall be further subject to
changes in applicable law (e.g., if legislation is passed permitting hospitals
to render lower levels of indigent care, providing for universal health coverage
or imposing on hospitals a tax in lieu of the provision of indigent care).

        10.14. CONTINUATION OF SERVICES. For a period of at least five (5) years
following the Closing, Buyer Entities will continue to operate each Hospital as
a general acute care facility licensed by the State of Oklahoma, and use their
best efforts to maintain each Hospital's JCAHO or AOA accreditation. For a
period of at least five (5) years following the Closing, Buyer Entities shall
continue to operate all essential services offered at each Hospital by a Seller
Entity as of the Closing Date, subject to (i) the availability of qualified
physicians in the community, (ii) such changes as may be necessary or
appropriate based on community needs, and (iii) economic feasibility. No
essential service may be discontinued, or substantially reduced in size or
scope, without the prior written approval of the Board of Trustees of the
Hospital, except for any consolidation of essential services among the Metro
Hospitals.

      10.15. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. During the first five (5) years following the
Closing, Buyer shall expend One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) for
capital expenditures for the Facilities, including, without limitation, funds
for new equipment, equipment replacement, facility renovations, new facilities,
medical office space, development of new services, quality improvement programs,

                                       54

<PAGE>

physician recruitment and other capital improvements. In addition, Buyer will
make a good faith analysis of the need for certain projects identified by Seller
in its current capital plan, including the construction of a heart hospital and
an orthopaedic center, and the expansion of the women's center, and will issue
prior to the Closing at a time mutually agreed to by the parties, communications
in support of those projects for which it determines there is a need, subject to
such limitations as it deems prudent, including the availability of funds. If
Buyer or a Buyer Entity enters into a Lease Agreement for the lease of Cushing
Regional Hospital, Buyer shall expend, and shall state in its Lease Agreement
for Cushing Regional Hospital its agreement to expend, approximately Two Million
Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,400,000) for a proposed major renovation and
expansion project for and on behalf of Cushing Regional Hospital and
approximately Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) for the proposed OU Family
Practice Medical Office Building. Buyer will not count the heart hospital
project, if undertaken, toward its $100,000,000 capital expenditures commitment.

      10.16. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. For a period of at least five (5) years
following the Closing, Buyer shall cause Buyer Entities to continue the
residency programs of Seller Entities in their current or comparable form,
subject to the continuation of the current arrangements with the programs'
medical schools or other sponsors and no significant adverse change in
government reimbursement.

      10.17. GRANDFATHERING OF MEDICAL STAFFS. Immediately following the
Closing, there will be no change or modification to the current medical staff
membership of, or staff privileges for, physicians in good standing on the
medical staff of each Hospital; provided, however, that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not limit the ability of the Board of
Trustees or medical executive committee of each Hospital to grant, withhold or
suspend medical staff appointments or clinical privileges in accordance with the
terms and provisions of the medical staff bylaws of the applicable Hospital.
More particularly, in order to ensure a smooth transition for the medical staff
of each Hospital, Buyer shall cause the Board of Trustees of each Hospital,
concurrently with the Closing to (i) appoint all of the physicians who are on
the medical staff of the Hospital immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Physicians") to the medical staff, in their then current categories; (ii) grant
all of the Physicians their then current clinical privileges; (iii) establish
the same medical staff sections and departments, where applicable; (iv) appoint
to the positions of Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs of Section and Department
Chairmen the Physicians who hold the positions immediately prior to the Closing;
(v) take no action to change any of the staff committees or their functions;
(vi) take no action to change any of the staff officers or committee members;
(vii) adopt the then current bylaws and incorporated documents, rules and
regulations of the medical staff of each Hospital; and (viii) adopt the then
currently proposed changes to the bylaws and incorporated documents, rules and
regulations of the medical staff, if then approved by the Hospital's medical
staff. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Buyer or
Buyer Entities from making changes or modifications to any of the foregoing
after a reasonable time subsequent to the Closing.

      10.18. USE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PERMITS. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, Buyer Entities shall have the right, for a period not to exceed
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, to operate under the
licenses and registrations of Seller Entities relating to controlled substances
and the operations of pharmacies and laboratories, until Buyer Entities are

                                       55

<PAGE>

able to obtain such licenses and registrations for themselves. In furtherance
thereof, Seller Entities shall execute and deliver to Buyer Entities at or prior
to the Closing limited powers of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit
K. Under the limited powers of attorney, Buyer Entities shall have sole
responsibility and liability for the dispensing of controlled substances and for
the operation of the pharmacies and laboratories and shall agree to indemnify
and hold harmless Seller Entities against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs and expenses that Seller Entities may incur as a result of the
actions that Buyer Entities, or their respective directors, officers,
principals, attorneys, employees agents or other representatives, may take or
fail to take under and pursuant to the limited powers of attorney. This covenant
to indemnify and hold harmless is independent of the agreement to indemnify and
hold harmless contained in Section 11.1 and is not subject to the limitations on
indemnification contained in Section 11.2.

      10.19. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Seller agrees, upon the request of Buyer, and
at Buyer's sole cost and expense, to cooperate and to use its good faith,
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in its efforts to obtain the
issuance to Buyer of audited financial statements of Seller Entities, with an
unqualified opinion of Seller's independent auditors, together with any other
financial statements or information that can reasonably be expected to be
required by Buyer to fully comply with Regulation S-X promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

      10.20. LOCKBOX ACCOUNTS. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall
transfer to, and otherwise vest in, Buyer the exclusive right to receive the
funds swept from Seller's lockbox accounts or other depository accounts for the
purpose of receiving the Accounts Receivable, and shall instruct the bank which
maintains such lockbox accounts or other depository accounts to transfer
automatically each business day all available funds held in the such lockbox
accounts or other depository accounts to an account designated by Buyer. If
Seller or any Seller Entity comes into possession of any payments with respect
to any Accounts Receivable, it shall deposit such payments into the lockbox
accounts or other depository accounts. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, Buyer or its designees shall have sole dominion and
control over the lockbox accounts or other depository accounts, including,
without limitation, the exclusive right to revoke any instructions given to the
bank that maintains the lockbox accounts or other depository accounts and the
exclusive right to cancel or change the automatic transfer instructions related
to the lockbox accounts or other depository accounts.

      10.21. SUBSEQUENT SALE. If Buyer decides to sell, merge, or otherwise
transfer or consolidate any of the Hospitals during a period when Buyer or Buyer
Entity is performing any operating covenants pursuant to Sections 10.12, 10.13,
10.14, 10.15 and 10.16, Buyer shall ensure that such subsequent owner of the
applicable Hospital agrees to fulfill Buyer's obligations under each of Sections
10.12, 10.13, 10.14, 10.15 and 10.16, as applicable.

      10.22. NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.

            (a) On the Execution Date, Seller has no knowledge of any fact that
would cause Buyer to be in breach of any of Buyer's representations, warranties,
covenants, undertakings or other agreements contained in this Agreement. At any
time from the Execution Date to the Closing Date, Seller shall give prompt
written notice to Buyer of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event

                                       56

<PAGE>

that has caused any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement to be untrue in any material respect and (ii) any failure of Seller to
comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Such
notice shall provide a reasonably detailed description of the relevant
circumstances. In addition, at any time from the Execution Date to the Closing
Date, Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer if Seller becomes aware
of the breach by Buyer of any of Buyer's representations, warranties, covenants,
undertakings or other agreements contained in this Agreement, but Seller's
knowledge shall not affect any right of Seller to possible indemnification
hereunder.

            (b) On the Execution Date, Buyer has no knowledge of any fact that
would cause Seller to be in breach of any of Seller's representations,
warranties, covenants, undertakings or other agreements contained in this
Agreement. At any time from the Execution Date to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
give prompt written notice to Seller of (i) the occurrence or failure to occur,
of any event that has caused any representation or warranty of Buyer contained
in this Agreement to be untrue in any material respect and (ii) any failure of
Buyer to comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Such notice shall provide a reasonably detailed description of the
relevant circumstances. In addition, at any time from the Execution Date to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall give prompt written notice to Seller if Buyer becomes
aware of the breach by Seller of any of Seller's representations, warranties,
covenants, undertakings or other agreements contained in this Agreement, but
Buyer's knowledge shall not affect any right of Buyer to possible
indemnification hereunder.

      10.23. USE OF NAMES. Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Buyer Entities
to not, use the name or reputation "Hillcrest HealthCare System", "Hillcrest" or
any variation thereof in any manner that would cause Seller or any Seller Entity
Organization to be in breach or violation of its obligations under and pursuant
to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Apria Healthcare Inc.,
Hillcrest Outpatient Medical Equipment and Supply Company and Hillcrest
HealthCare System, dated July 31, 2001, or that certain Non-Competition and
Confidentiality Agreement by and between Hillcrest HealthCare System and Apria
Healthcare, Inc., dated July 31, 2001.

      10.24. BUYER'S POST-CLOSING INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS. Buyer, at its sole cost
and expense, shall, and shall cause Buyer Entities to, obtain and keep in full
force and effect insurance coverage on the Facilities and the Purchased Assets.
Such insurance coverage shall be underwritten by reputable insurance companies,
shall insure against liabilities and losses customarily insured against by
hospitals and health systems that own assets similar to the Facilities and the
Purchased Assets, and shall have liability limits customary for hospitals and
health systems that own assets similar to the Facilities and the Purchased
Assets.

      10.25. REPAIRS. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to perform the work described
on Schedule 10.25, for which it has segregated and set aside Seven Hundred Forty
Thousand Dollars ($740,000) to perform. If Seller completes the work described
on Schedule 10.25, it shall keep the difference between Seven Hundred Forty
Thousand Dollars ($740,000) and the amount it expended to perform the work , if
any. If Seller fails to complete the work described on Schedule 10.25, it shall
pay to Buyer the

                                       57

<PAGE>

difference between Seven Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($740,000) and the
amount it expended to perform the work, if any, through an adjustment to working
capital. To the extent Seller performs the work described on Schedule 10.25,
Seller shall have no liability to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as
defined in Section 11.3) under Section 11.3 and no claim by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be made to the extent that such claim relates to the
object of the work performed or to the work itself performed.

11. INDEMNIFICATION.

      11.1. INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.2, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, principals,
attorneys, employees, agents or other representatives (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs (including, without limitation, court costs and costs of appeal)
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and fees
of expert consultants and witnesses) (collectively, the "Seller Losses") that
such Seller Indemnified Party incurs as a result of, or with respect to (i) any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Buyer under this Agreement, (ii) any
breach by Buyer or an Affiliate of, or any failure by Buyer or an Affiliate to
perform, any covenant or agreement of, or required to be performed by, Buyer or
an Affiliate under this Agreement, (iii) any of the Assumed Liabilities, or (iv)
any claim made by a third party with respect to the operation of the Facilities
or the Purchased Assets on or after the Closing Date. No provision in this
Agreement shall prevent Buyer from pursing any of its legal rights or remedies
that may be granted to Buyer by law against any person or legal entity other
than Seller and its Affiliates.

      11.2. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Buyer shall be under no liability to indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties under Section 11.1 and no claim under Section 11.1 shall: (i) be made to
the extent that such claim relates to a liability of the Seller Indemnified
Parties arising out of or relating to any act, omission, event or occurrence
connected with: (A) the use, ownership or operation of any of the Facilities
prior to the Closing Date, or (B) the use, operation or ownership of any of the
Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date, other than as specifically included
in the Assumed Liabilities; (ii) be made to the extent such claim relates to an
obligation or liability for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer pursuant
to Section 11.3; and (iii) with respect to matters encompassed by Section
11.1(i), accrue to the Seller Indemnified Parties unless and only to the extent
that (A) the liability of Buyer in respect of any single claim exceeds Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000) and (B) the total liability of Buyer in respect of
all claims in the aggregate exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)
(the "Seller Aggregate Amount"), in which event the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to seek indemnification under Section 11.1 (i) for all claims
only in an amount of Seller Losses which exceed the Seller Aggregate Amount.

            (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.2(a), the
total liability of Buyer for indemnification under Section 11.1(i), in the
aggregate, shall be limited to an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the limitations

                                       58

<PAGE>

contained in this Section 11.2(b) shall not apply to any indemnification claims
arising under Section 11.1(i) as a result of the intentional misrepresentation
or fraud of Buyer.

            (c) If a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to recover any sum
(whether by payment, discount, credit or otherwise) from any third party in
respect of any matter for which a claim of indemnity could be made against Buyer
hereunder, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to recover
such sum from such third party and any sum recovered will reduce the amount of
the claim. If Buyer pays to a Seller Indemnified Party an amount in respect of a
claim, and the Seller Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from a thirty
party a sum which is referable to that claim, Seller shall cause the Seller
Indemnified Party to promptly repay to Buyer so much of the amount paid to it as
does not exceed the sum recovered from the third party less all reasonable
costs, charges and expenses incurred by Seller and the Seller Indemnified Party
in obtaining payment in respect of that claim and in recovering that sum from
the third party.

      11.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11.4, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, principals,
attorneys, employees, agents or other representatives (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs (including, without limitation, court costs and costs of appeal)
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and fees
of expert consultants and witnesses) (collectively, the "Buyer Losses") that
such Buyer Indemnified Party incurs as a result of, or with respect to (i) any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Seller under this Agreement, (ii) any
breach by Seller or an Affiliate of, or any failure by Seller or an Affiliate to
perform, any covenant or agreement of, or required to be performed by, Seller or
an Affiliate under this Agreement, (iii) any of the Excluded Liabilities, or
(iv) any claim made by a third party with respect to the operation of the
Facilities or the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date. No provision in
this Agreement shall prevent Seller from pursuing any of its legal rights or
remedies that may be granted to Seller by law against any person or legal entity
other than Buyer and its Affiliates.

      11.4. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall be under no liability to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under Section 11.3 and no claim under Section 11.3 shall: (i) be made to
the extent that such claim relates to a liability of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties arising out of or relating to any act, omission, event or occurrence
connected with: (A) the use, ownership or operation of any of the Facilities on
and after the Closing Date, or (B) the use, ownership or operation of any of the
Purchased Assets on and after the Closing Date, other than as specifically
included in the Excluded Liabilities; (ii) be made to the extent that such claim
relates to an obligation or liability for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify
Seller pursuant to Section 11.1; and (iii) with respect to matters encompassed
by Section 11.3(i) (other than with respect to the breach of any representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.25), accrue to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties unless and only to the extent that (A) the liability of Seller in
respect of any single claim exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) and (B) the
total liability of Seller in respect of all claims in the aggregate exceeds Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Buyer Aggregate Amount"), in which
event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek

                                       59

<PAGE>

indemnification under Section 11.3(i) for all claims only in an amount of Buyer
Losses which exceed the Buyer Aggregate Amount.

            (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.4(a), the
total liability of Seller for indemnification under Section 11.3(i), in the
aggregate, shall be limited to (i) the proceeds from the transactions
contemplated herein received and held by Seller and/or any Seller Entity
Organization (and any earnings thereon) if and until Seller and/or any Seller
Entity Organization transfers the proceeds of the transactions contemplated
herein to the Foundation (as defined in Section 12.27) and (ii) the net value of
the Foundation, with "net value" defined as the assets of the Foundation, minus
the liabilities of the Foundation, once Seller and/or any Seller Entity
Organization transfers the proceeds of the transactions contemplated herein to
the Foundation, provided when Seller and/or any Seller Entity Organization
transfers the proceeds of the transactions contemplated herein to the
Foundation, it transfers all of said proceeds (and all earnings thereon) to the
Foundation. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this preceding
sentence, the total liability of Seller for indemnification under Section
11.3(i), in the aggregate, with respect to a breach of any representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.25, shall be One Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($1,500,000). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the limitations
contained in this Section 11.4(b) shall not apply to any indemnification claims
arising under Section 11.3(i) as a result of the intentional misrepresentation
or fraud of Seller.

            (c) If a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to recover any sum
(whether by payment, discount, credit or otherwise) from any third party in
respect of any matter for which a claim of indemnity could be made against
Seller hereunder, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
recover such sum from such third party and any sum recovered will reduce the
amount of the claim. If Seller pays to a Buyer Indemnified Party an amount in
respect of a claim, and the Buyer Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from a
third party a sum which is referable to that claim, Buyer shall cause the Buyer
Indemnified Party to promptly repay to Seller so much of the amount paid by it
as does not exceed the sum recovered from the third party less all reasonable
costs, charges and expenses incurred by Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Party in
obtaining payment in respect of that claim and in recovering that sum from the
third party.

      11.5. NOTICE AND CONTROL OF LITIGATION. If any claim or liability is
asserted in writing by a third party against a party entitled to indemnification
under this Section 11 (the "Indemnified Party") which would give rise to a claim
under this Section 11, the Indemnified Party shall notify the person giving the
indemnity (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the same within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such written assertion of a claim or liability. The
Indemnifying Party, at its own cost and expense, shall have the right to defend
a claim and control the defense, settlement, and prosecution of any litigation.
If the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) days after notice of such claim,
fails to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall (upon further written
notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise, or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and at
the risk of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise, or final determination thereof. Anything in this Section 11.5
notwithstanding, (i) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a

                                       60

<PAGE>

result of money damages or other money payments, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, at its own cost and expense, to defend, compromise, and settle
such claim, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant to the Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect of such claim. All parties agree to cooperate fully as
necessary in the defense of such matters. Should the Indemnified Party fail to
notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above, the indemnity with
respect to the subject matter of the required notice shall be limited to the
damages that would have resulted absent the Indemnified Party's failure to
notify the Indemnifying Party in the time required above after taking into
account such actions as could have been taken by the Indemnifying Party had it
received timely notice from the Indemnified Party.

      11.6. NOTICE OF CLAIM. If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any breach
of the representations or warranties of the Indemnifying Party hereunder or any
other basis for indemnification under this Section 11 (except as otherwise
provided for under Section 12.3), the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the same within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of such breach or claim, specifying in detail the circumstances and facts
which give rise to a claim under this Section 11. Should the Indemnified Party
fail to notify the Indemnifying Party within the time frame required above, the
indemnity with respect to the subject matter of the required notice shall be
limited to the damages that would have nonetheless resulted absent the
Indemnified Party's failure to notify the Indemnifying Party in the time
required above after taking into account such actions as could have been taken
by the Indemnifying Party had it received timely notice from the Indemnified
Party.

      11.7. NO PUNITIVE DAMAGES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, in the absence of fraud, neither Seller nor Buyer
(nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives) shall, in any event,
be liable to the other (or any of its Affiliates or representatives) for any
exemplary or punitive damages relating to the breach or alleged breach or
nonperformance or alleged nonperformance of this Agreement, except to the extent
awarded by a court in a third-party claim.

      11.8. EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or
inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty
made by Seller or Buyer shall be the remedies provided by this Section 11,
except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

      12.1. SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS.

            (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that, although Buyer has
completed substantially all of its due diligence as of the Execution Date, Buyer
will complete some additional due diligence following the Execution Date.
Buyer's additional due diligence is not intended to unduly delay or hinder the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but instead, is intended to assist
Buyer in operationalizing the business of the Facilities following the Closing
Date and verifying the accuracy and completeness of information set forth in
draft Schedules presented by Seller. As of the Execution Date, the parties have
not fully prepared, reviewed and/or agreed to the Schedules contemplated by this
Agreement, with the exception of the Schedules the parties have mutually agreed
to attach to this Agreement as of the Execution Date (if any). Between the
Execution Date and ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, each party
shall promptly deliver to the other party each of its remaining Schedules when
it believes the Schedule to be substantially complete and accurate (each a
"Baseline Schedule").

            (b) Between the Execution Date and ten (10) business days prior to
the Closing Date, each party may from time to time modify, update or amend one
or more of its Schedules, by delivering to the other party a written notice of
change (the "Change Notice") in which it notifies the other party of each
Schedule it proposes to modify, update or amend and in which it includes a copy
of each Schedule as modified, updated or amended (the "Modified Schedule"), as
well as any supporting documents (e.g., contracts or other written notices).
Each Modified Schedule shall become a part of this Agreement and shall replace
the Schedule it is modifying, updating or amending, unless the other party
objects to the Modified Schedule in whole or in part within five (5) business
days after its receipt of the Change Notice, in which case the parties shall
follow the procedures set forth in this Section.

            (c) A party may object to (i) a Baseline Schedule in whole or in
part by delivering to the other party within ten (10) business days of the date
of receipt of the Baseline Schedule, a written notice of objection (the
"Objection Notice") which sets forth the grounds for its objection or (ii) a
Modified Schedule in whole or in part by delivering to the other party within
five (5) business days after its receipt of the applicable Change Notice, the
Objection Notice, in which it sets forth the grounds for its objection.

            (d) Buyer shall have grounds for rejecting a contract listed on
Schedule 1.1(h) if in its reasonable belief the contract meets one or more of
the following standards: the contract contains terms or conditions that violate
applicable law; the contract imposes material and adverse limitations on Buyer's
or Buyer Entity's ability to operate the Purchased Assets in the same general
manner as they were operated by Seller and Seller Entities; the contract
contains covenants not to compete or similar exclusivity provisions that
materially restrict the activities of Seller or Seller Entities at the
Facilities and would materially restrict Buyer's or Buyer Entities' activities
at the Facilities; the contract contains material terms that are commercially
unreasonable; or the contract is an employment agreement with a management-level
employee.

                                       62

<PAGE>

            (e) Following receipt of an Objection Notice, the parties shall work
together in good faith to: (i) correct any inaccuracies in the Schedules which
are identified in the Objection Notice; (ii) attempt to resolve any legal issues
identified with contracts and, if successful, list the contract on the Assumed
Contracts Schedule, or if unsuccessful, list the contract on the Excluded
Contracts Schedule; and (iii) resolve any disagreements related to the content
of the Objection Notice.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
inclusion of new or different information on a Modified Schedule to which a
party has objected to in a timely-sent Objection Notice and which has not been
resolved pursuant to Section 12.1(e) shall not prejudice or otherwise affect a
party's right to seek relief for the other party's breach of a representation or
warranty or affect the objecting party's right to indemnification under Section
11.1(i) or Section 11.3(i) (based upon the Baseline Schedule, that is, without
taking into account any modification, update or amendment of the Baseline
Schedule). In the event that, after the parties have followed the procedures
specified in Section 12.1(e), the remaining disputed items, individually or in
the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the use by Buyer or Buyer
Entities of any material portion of the Facilities or the business or operations
of Buyer or Buyer Entities following the Closing Date, Buyer, acting reasonably
and in good faith, may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Seller.
As used in this Section 12.1(f) only, "material adverse effect" shall mean
matters which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have an impact of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or more.

            (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.1, Buyer's
objections to matters disclosed on Schedule 3.11 or the state of title to the
Real Property shall be governed by the procedures specified in Section 5.8. In
addition, following receipt of any Objection Notice containing objections to
exceptions or encumbrances identified in the Title Commitment as described in
Section 5.8, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to, at
Seller's expense, (i) satisfy, release or cure any reasonable objections prior
to or concurrently with the Closing, or (b) if acceptable to Buyer, cause such
exceptions or encumbrances to be removed from the Title Commitment or insured
over by an appropriate title insurance endorsement, all in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer.

            (h) Any disclosure made in the Schedules with reference to any
Section or Schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with
respect to all other Sections or Schedules, as the case may be, of this
Agreement to which such disclosure may apply, so long as application to such
Section or Schedule is reasonably discernible from such disclosure.

            (i) Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, the parties
shall work together in good faith to draft, negotiate, revise, review and
finalize the Exhibits contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that comports
with the expressed intentions, understandings and commitments set forth in this
Agreement. If the parties are unable to agree upon the content of any Exhibit by
at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, the parties jointly
shall select and retain independent national health care counsel to resolve the
matter (the "Independent Counsel"). Within five (5) business days following its
retention, Independent Counsel shall: (i) meet with the Chief Executive Officers
of Buyer and Seller (or their respective designees) to hear about the
disagreement and the parties' respective opinions and interests related thereto:
and (ii) draft a revised and equitable version of any disputed Exhibit, taking
into account the interests expressed by the

                                       63

<PAGE>

parties (the "Final Exhibits"). The parties shall be bound by the decisions of
Independent Counsel and by the Final Exhibits. If the Final Exhibits contain
agreements revised by Independent Counsel, then within three (3) business days
following its receipt of the Final Exhibits, each party (if it is a party to the
agreement) shall execute and deliver to the other a copy of each such agreement
or each party (if its Affiliate is a party to the agreement) shall cause its
Affiliate to execute and deliver to the other a copy of each such agreement. The
parties shall share equally the costs of Independent Counsel.

      12.2. ADDITIONAL ASSURANCES. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
self-operative and shall not require further agreement by the parties except as
may be herein specifically provided to the contrary; provided, however, at the
request of a party, the other party or parties shall execute such additional
instruments and take such additional actions as the requesting party may
reasonably request for purposes of effecting this Agreement. In addition and
from time to time after Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such other actions as
Buyer may reasonably request, to more effectively convey and transfer full
right, title, and interest to, vest in, and place Buyer Entities in legal and
actual possession of, any and all of the Facilities and the Purchased Assets.
Seller shall also furnish Buyer with such information and documents in its
possession or under its control, or which Seller can execute or cause to be
executed, as will enable Buyer Entities to prosecute any and all petitions,
applications, claims, and demands relating to or constituting a part of the
Facilities or the Purchased Assets. Additionally, each party shall cooperate and
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to encourage its directors,
officers, and employees cooperate with the other party on and after Closing in
furnishing information, evidence, testimony, and other assistance in connection
with any action, proceeding, arrangement, or dispute of any nature with respect
to matters pertaining to all periods prior to and after the Closing in respect
of the items subject to this Agreement.

      12.3. CONSENTED ASSIGNMENT. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any
claim, right, contract, license, lease, commitment, sales order, or purchase
order if an attempted assignment thereof without the consent of the other party
thereto would constitute a breach thereof or in any material way affect the
rights of Seller or any the Seller Entity thereunder, unless such consent is
obtained. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain any third party consents to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If the goods or services provided under an Assumed Contract are
available from another source on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable or if the failure to obtain such consent to the assignment of any
Assumed Contact which by its term requires consent or as to which assignment is
ineffectual absent consent would not materially adversely affect the operation
of any of the Facilities, then the failure to obtain such consent shall not
constitute a breach of or default under this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in good faith in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide for
Buyer Entity the benefits under any such claim, right, contract, license, lease,
commitment, sales order, or purchase order, including, without limitation,
enforcement of any and all rights of Seller or any Seller Entity against the
other party or parties thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation by such
other party or otherwise.

      12.4. CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND DISCRETION. Except as herein expressly
provided to the contrary, whenever this Agreement requires any consent or
approval to be given by a party, or

                                       64

<PAGE>

whenever a party must or may exercise discretion, the parties agree that such
consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and such
discretion shall be reasonably exercised.

      12.5. LEGAL FEES AND COSTS. In the event a party elects to incur legal
expenses to enforce or interpret any provision of this Agreement by judicial
proceedings, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover such legal
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and
necessary disbursements at all court levels, in addition to any other relief to
which such party shall be entitled.

      12.6. GOVERNING LAW; VENUE. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Oklahoma as
applied to contracts made and performed within the State of Oklahoma. All
parties agree that venue regarding any action arising hereunder and with respect
to the documents and agreements executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be exclusively in the state and federal courts in the
State of Oklahoma, and all parties consent to the jurisdiction thereof.

      12.7. BENEFIT/ASSIGNMENT. Subject to provisions herein to the contrary,
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors, and assigns. No
party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party, provided, however, that any party may, without the prior written consent
of the other party, assign its rights hereunder to one or more Affiliates (as
defined in Section 12.18), but in such event, the assignor shall be required to
remain obligated hereunder in the same manner as if such assignment had not been
effected. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.22, Seller Entities and
Buyer Entities shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

      12.8. BROKERAGE FEES. Each party agrees to be solely liable for and
obligated to satisfy and discharge all loss, cost, damage, or expense arising
out of claims for fees or commissions of brokers employed or alleged to have
been employed by such party.

      12.9. COST OF TRANSACTION. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, the parties agree as follows: (i) Seller shall pay
the fees, expenses, and disbursements of Seller and its agents, representatives,
accountants, and legal counsel incurred in connection with the subject matter
hereof and any amendments hereto; and (ii) Buyer shall pay the fees, expenses,
and disbursements of Buyer and its agents, representatives, accountants and
legal counsel incurred in connection with the subject matter hereof and any
amendments hereto. Seller shall pay the costs of the Title Policy and any state
and local documentary stamp tax due in connection with the transfer and
conveyance of the Owned Real Property. Buyer shall pay the costs of the Surveys,
all filing fees required to obtain approvals or waivers under the HSR Act and
all state and local sales taxes incurred in connection with the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Assets. In addition, Buyer shall pay all bank fees and
other fees and expenses charged by the applicable banks or other lending
institutions to convert the debt of Cushing Regional Hospital from tax-exempt to
taxable (estimated to be approximately Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000) to
Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000)) and all bank fees and other fees and
expenses charged by the applicable banks or other lending institutions to
convert the debt of Eastern Oklahoma Medical Center from tax-exempt to taxable
(estimated to be approximately Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000) to Seventy
Thousand Dollars ($70,000)).

                                       65

      12.10. CONFIDENTIALITY. It is understood by the parties hereto that the
information, documents, and instruments delivered to Buyer by Seller and its
agents and the information, documents, and instruments delivered to Seller by
Buyer and its agents are of a confidential and proprietary nature. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that both prior and subsequent to the Closing it will
strictly maintain the confidentiality of all such confidential information,
documents, or instruments delivered to it by the other party hereto or its
agents in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or in compliance
with the terms, conditions, and covenants hereof and will only disclose such
information, documents, and instruments to its duly authorized officers,
members, directors, representatives, and agents (including consultants,
attorneys, and accountants of each party) (who have a need for such information,
documents and instruments and who are informed of their confidential nature) and
applicable governmental authorities in connection with any required notification
or application for approval or exemption therefrom as may be necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto further agrees that if the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated, it will promptly return all such information documents and
instruments and all copies thereof in its possession to the other party to this
Agreement and will promptly destroy all materials generated by it or on its
behalf containing such information, documents or instruments. Each of the
parties hereto recognizes that any breach of this Section 12.10 would result in
irreparable harm to the other party to this Agreement and its Affiliates and
that therefore either Seller or Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction to
prohibit any such breach or anticipated breach, without the necessity of posting
a bond, cash, or otherwise, in addition to all of its other legal and equitable
remedies. Nothing in this Section 12.10, however, shall prohibit the use of such
confidential information, documents, or information for such governmental
filings or other notices in connection with outstanding notes, bonds or other
securities issued by or on behalf of Buyer or Seller as in the opinion of
Buyer's counsel or Seller's counsel are required by agreements existing on the
date hereof, law or governmental regulations or are otherwise required to be
disclosed pursuant to applicable federal or state law. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge that the obligation of confidentiality set forth in this Section
12.10 is in addition to the obligations under that certain Confidentiality
Agreement between Buyer and Seller dated _______________, 2004 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

      12.11. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Seller and Buyer mutually agree that neither
party hereto nor its Affiliates shall release, publish, or otherwise make
available to the public in any manner whatsoever any information or announcement
regarding the transactions herein contemplated without the prior written consent
of both Seller and Buyer, except for information and filings reasonably
necessary to be directed to governmental agencies to fully and lawfully effect
the transactions herein contemplated or required in connection with securities
and other laws in effect on the date hereof or to comply with any continuing
disclosure obligation of Seller or Buyer with respect to its outstanding debt.

      12.12. WAIVER OF BREACH. The waiver by any party of a breach or violation
of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as, or be construed to
constitute, a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereof.

      12.13. NOTICE. Any notice, demand, or communication required, permitted,
or desired to be given hereunder shall be deemed effectively given when
personally delivered, when received by

the gender of all words herein shall include the masculine, feminine, and
neuter, and the number of all words herein shall include the singular and
plural.

      12.16. DIVISIONS AND HEADINGS. The divisions of this Agreement into
sections and subsections and the use of captions and headings in connection
therewith are solely for convenience and shall have no legal effect in
construing the provisions of this Agreement.

      12.17. SURVIVAL. All of the representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements made by the parties in this Agreement or pursuant hereto in any
certificate, instrument, or document shall survive the consummation of the
transactions described herein, and may be fully and completely relied upon by
Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, notwithstanding any investigation
heretofore or hereafter made by any of them or on behalf of any of them, and
shall not be deemed merged into any instruments or agreements delivered at the
Closing or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.17 which may
be to the contrary, any claim, demand, or cause of action with respect to a
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement (other than
representations or warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.12, 4.1,
4.2 and 4.3, which shall survive indefinitely, representations or warranties
contained in Sections 3.8, 3.9, 3.13, 3.15, 3.17 and 3.23, which shall survive
until the longer of five (5) years or ninety (90) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations relating to the underlying claim,
including extensions and waivers) must be made or brought, if at all, within two
(2) years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the major
equipment (as defined in Section 3.25) included within the Purchased Assets
shall be presumptively deemed to have met the standards set forth in Section
3.25 except for major equipment that Buyer notifies Seller, within thirty (30)
days following the Closing Date, does not meet such standards. For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section 12.17 shall not affect any rights to bring claims after
two (2) years based on (x) any covenant or agreement of the parties which
contemplates performance after the Closing, (y) the obligations of Buyer under
Section 11.1(ii), 11.1(iii) or 11.1(iv) or (z) the obligations of Seller under
Section 11.3(ii), 11.3(iii) or 11.3(iv).

entity whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

      12.19. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO DEMAND THAT ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PARTIES HERETO BE TRIED BY JURY. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS TO ANY
AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY ARISING FROM ANY SOURCE INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE THEREIN,
COMMON LAW OR ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OR REGULATIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO

                                       68

<PAGE>

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING ITS RIGHT TO DEMAND
TRIAL BY JURY.

      12.20. ACCOUNTING DATE. The transactions contemplated hereby shall be
effective for accounting purposes only as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date,
unless otherwise agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer. The parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to be effective as of a
month end.

      12.21. NO INFERENCES. Inasmuch as this Agreement is the result of
negotiations between sophisticated parties of equal bargaining power represented
by counsel, no inference in favor of, or against, either party shall be drawn
from the fact that any portion of this Agreement has been drafted by or on
behalf of such party.

      12.22. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of Buyer and Seller and their
respective permitted successors or assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer, and this Agreement shall not confer, third-party beneficiary
rights upon any other person except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

      12.23. ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was
not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

      12.24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT/AMENDMENT. Subject to Section 12.10, this
Agreement supersedes all previous contracts or understandings, including any
offers, letters of intent, proposals or letters of understanding, and
constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature existing between
or among the parties respecting the within subject matter, and no party shall be
entitled to benefits other than those specified herein. Subject to Section
12.10, as between or among the parties, no oral statements or prior written
material not specifically incorporated herein shall be of any force and effect.
Subject to Section 12.10, the parties specifically acknowledge that in entering
into and executing this Agreement, the parties rely solely upon the
representations and agreements contained in this Agreement and no others.
Subject to Section 12.10, all prior representations or agreements, whether
written or verbal, not expressly incorporated herein are superseded, and no
changes in or additions to this Agreement shall be recognized unless and until
made in writing and signed by all parties hereto. This Agreement may be executed
in two or more counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an original
and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

      12.25. RISK OF LOSS. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the
contrary, except for the Introduction with respect to Strategic Facilities, the
risk of loss in respect of casualty to the Purchased Assets shall be borne by
Seller prior to the time of Closing and by Buyer thereafter.

                                       69

<PAGE>

      12.26. OTHER OWNERS OF PURCHASED ASSETS. The parties acknowledge that
certain Purchased Assets may be owned by Affiliates of Seller (including Seller
Entity Organizations that are not Seller Entities) and not Seller or the Seller
Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for purposes of all
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, Seller
agrees that (i) its obligations with respect to any Purchased Assets shall be
joint and several with any Affiliate which owns or controls such Purchased
Assets, (ii) the representations and warranties herein, to the extent
applicable, shall be deemed to have been made by, on behalf of and with respect
to, such Affiliates in their ownership capacity, and (iii) it has the legal
capacity to cause, and it shall cause, any Affiliate which owns or controls any
Purchased Assets to meet all of Seller's obligations under this Agreement with
respect to such Purchased Assets. Seller hereby waives any defense to a claim
made by Buyer under this Agreement based on the failure of any person who owns
or controls the Purchased Assets to be a party to this Agreement. In lieu of the
foregoing, however, Seller, at its sole option, may cause the Affiliate which
owns the Purchased Assets to convey the Purchased Assets to Seller or any Seller
Affiliate, which will then subsequently convey the Purchased Assets to Buyer or
a Buyer Entity pursuant to this Agreement.

      12.27. FOUNDATION. Seller anticipates that it may elect to transfer
certain of its assets, including all or a portion of the Purchase Price, to a
charitable foundation or similar tax exempt organization (herein, the
"Foundation"). The formation of the Foundation may be done at Closing or some

shall cause the Foundation to execute and deliver a signature page or addendum
to this Agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer whereby the
Foundation agrees to be bound by this Agreement for the following purposes: (i)
to assume joint and several liability for the indemnification obligations of
Seller set forth in Section 11.3; and (ii) to agree to be bound by Section 9.
Prior to any such transfer of all or a portion of the Purchase Price, the
Foundation shall (i) deliver an opinion of counsel in form and substance
satisfactory to Buyer to the effect of the due organization of the Foundation,
and the valid, binding nature of execution of the agreements required by this
Section and their enforceability in accordance with their terms, and such other
matters as Buyer shall reasonably determine are needed, (ii) deliver certified
resolutions authorizing execution of the foregoing, and (iii) execute and
deliver such other instruments and agreements, and take such other action as
Buyer may reasonably request.

representation of fact or future obligation, means that the representation does
not contain any statement or omission of fact that a reasonable purchaser would
consider important in deciding whether to consummate a purchase. "Material",
when used to qualify any representation of fact relating to a financial item,
means a matter resulting in a difference in revenues or expenses of at least Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) in the aggregate on an annual basis.
"Material," when used to modify any contract means (a) that the contract would
be considered significant to any reasonable person having experience in the
subject matter of the contract; (b) that the contract would be considered
important by a reasonable purchaser in deciding whether to consummate a
purchase; (c) that the contract would result in a difference in revenues or
expenses of at least Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate;
