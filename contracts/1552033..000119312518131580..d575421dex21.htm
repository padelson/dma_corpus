matters referred to in limbs (i) to (viii) of the definition of Leakage; and
(ii) to recover any amount in respect of VAT which is recoverable as input tax
(as determined by the Purchaser acting reasonably) in respect of the matters
referred to in limbs (i) to (viii) of the definition of "Leakage".

(e) If, at any time prior to the date that is three months after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser identifies that Leakage has occurred which has

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
deliver within three (3) months of the Closing Date, a written notice to the
Relevant Seller, specifying in reasonable detail the amount of the Leakage
alleged to have been received by such Relevant Seller, any member of such
Sellers Group or any Connected Person of any of the foregoing (or from which
any such Person benefited, as the case may be) (the " _Leakage Notice_ "). No
Seller shall have any liability or obligation to the Purchaser, the Company or
any other Person in respect of a breach of _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ or
otherwise under this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ except to the extent it is finally
agreed or determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ that such Seller
is liable for Leakage which is either notified to the Purchaser or otherwise
identified prior to Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ or set
forth in a Leakage Notice delivered prior to the date that is three
months following the Closing Date in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_. The Relevant Seller shall be deemed to have accepted a Leakage
Notice, except to the extent that such Relevant Seller delivers a written
notice to the Purchaser disputing the relevant amount (" _Dispute Notice_ ")

Section 7.18 _Section 280G Election_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall submit to the shareholders of the Company, for approval in
accordance with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, a written
consent in favor of a single proposal to render the parachute payment
provisions of Section 280G inapplicable to (a) any and all payments or
benefits that might result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of
any amount or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by
reason of Section 280G or that would be subject to an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code (together, the " _Section_ __ _ 280G Payments_"),
and (b) with respect to which Section 280G Payments the Company has obtained a
Waiver (as defined below) (together, the " _Waived Section_ __ _ 280G
Payments_"). Any such shareholder approval shall be sought by the Company in a
manner which is intended to satisfy all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including
Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations. The Company agrees that:
(i) in the absence of such shareholder approval, no Waived Section 280G
Payments shall be made to the extent they would cause any amounts to
constitute "excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G; and (ii) as
promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and deliver to the Purchaser, a
waiver, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser (a "
_Waiver_ "), from each Person who might receive any Section 280G Payment;
provided that the Company shall not be in breach of this covenant solely as a
result of the refusal of any Person who is a "disqualified individual" (for
purposes of Section 280G) to waive the applicable Section 280G Payments and
submit them to the shareholder vote, so long as the Company used reasonable
efforts to solicit such Waiver (provided that the Company shall not be
required to provide any additional value to such Person in order to receive
such Waiver). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any contract,
agreement or plan is entered into by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and a
"disqualified individual" (as defined under Section 280G) before the Closing
Date (the " _Purchaser Arrangements_ "), the Purchaser shall provide a copy of
such contract, agreement or plan to the Company at least ten (10) Business
Days before the Closing Date and shall cooperate with the Company in good
faith in order to calculate or determine the value (for purposes of Section
280G) of any payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein to the
extent that any payments or benefits under such contact, agreement or plan
might constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G. The form and
substance of all shareholder approval documents contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 7.18_, including the Waivers and any Section 280G analysis in customary
form, shall be subject to prior review and reasonable comment by the
Purchaser, which comments shall be considered in good faith.

to Tax.

respect of which an additional amount has been paid under _Section_ __ _

Representative, such Seller or their respective Affiliates may be directly
adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though
the Retained Counsel may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. The
Purchaser and the Company further agree that, as to all communications among
the Retained Counsel, the Seller Representative, any Affiliates of the Seller
Representative, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that relate in any way to
the Transactions, the attorneyclient privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Seller Representative and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other
than a Party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by the Retained
Counsel to such third party or the use thereof by the Retained Counsel in
connection with its representation of a Party in such dispute; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative.

 

(b) After the Closing, none of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall have any right to access or control any of
Retained Counsels records relating to or affecting the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall be the property of (and be controlled by) the
Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers. In addition, it would be
impractical to remove all Attorney-Client Communications from the records
(including e-mails and other electronic files) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
not to, use any Attorney-Client Communication remaining in the records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after Closing in a manner that may
be adverse to the Seller Representative, the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates.

(c) From and after Closing (a) the attorney-client privilege, all other
evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to all
Attorney-Client Communications belong to the Seller Representative and shall
not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Company, or any of their
Subsidiaries, and (b) the Seller Representative, on behalf of the Sellers,
shall have the exclusive right to control, assert, or waive the attorney-
client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of
client confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client Communications.
Accordingly, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, (x)
assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client
Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person
that is not a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller other than as provided
herein; or (y) take any action which could cause any Attorney-Client
Communication to cease being a confidential communication or to otherwise lose
protection under the attorney-client privilege or any other evidentiary
privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with a Person that
is not a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller. Furthermore, the Purchaser
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries),

**** Confidential Treatment has been requested for certain redacted provisions
of this exhibit. The redacted provisions are identified by asterisks and
enclosed by brackets. The confidential portions have been filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission  that in the event of a dispute between the Seller Representative, any Seller
or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any
matter in which the Retained Counsel represented both parties, neither the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence, nor any right
to any other evidentiary privilege shall protect from disclosure to the
Seller Representative, the Sellers or their respective Affiliates any
information or documents developed or shared during the course of such
Retained Counsels representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
of a post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not a Seller or an Affiliate
of a Seller, the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including, after
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) may, with consent of the Seller
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), access and
use Attorney-Client Communications in the current possession of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that it believes reasonably necessary to defend the
dispute.

 

Section 11.20 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated
hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall reexecute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

 

Section 11.21 _Guarantee_.

 

(a) Parent is executing this Agreement to guaranty the payment and
performance of the Purchaser under this Agreement. Parent guarantees
irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally and as a primary obligation (and
not as surety only) that the Purchaser shall fully, completely and timely pay
and perform all of its obligations and assume all of the
Purchasers liabilities described in this Agreement, in each case, strictly
in accordance with the terms hereof (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). If the
Purchaser fails or refuses to pay or perform any such obligations and
liabilities, Parent shall, without any notice or demand whatsoever,
immediately pay or perform such obligations, as applicable. Parent agrees that
this guarantee constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of
collection. Parent hereby expressly waives (to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law) diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, all notices whatsoever, any
requirement that any Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or
proceed against the Purchaser under this Agreement or any other agreement
referred to herein and any other circumstance (including any statute of
limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the
Company, any Seller or the Seller Representative that might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, Parent or any other
guarantor or surety. The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 11.21_ shall
survive the Closing and/or a termination of this Agreement and continue in
full force and effect thereafter.

**** Confidential Treatment has been requested for certain redacted provisions
of this exhibit. The redacted provisions are identified by asterisks and
enclosed by brackets. The confidential portions have been filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (b) There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.21_. The obligations of Parent hereunder shall be
continuing, absolute and unconditional and such obligations shall be binding
upon Parent, its successors and assigns and inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Company, the Sellers and the Seller Representative and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 11.21_ shall continue to be effective, or be
automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or
performance, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored, returned or rejected by a Party for
any reason, including upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution,
liquidation or reorganization of the Purchaser, or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, the Purchaser or any substantial part of its property,
or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. Parent hereby
waives all claims of waiver, release, surrender, abstraction or compromise and
all set-offs, counterclaims, cross-claims, recoupments or other defenses that
it may have against the Company, the Sellers or the Seller Representative, as
the case may be, except for those available to the Purchaser under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations
of Parent hereunder are unconditional and irrevocable and will not be
discharged by: (i) any modification of, or amendment or supplement to, this
Agreement, (ii) any furnishing or acceptance of security or exchange or
release of any security or (iii) any waiver, consent or other action or
inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any right, remedy or power with
respect to the Purchaser or any change in the structure of the Purchaser.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
agrees that it will indemnify the other Parties, as the case may be, on
demand for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred (i) by the Company, any Seller or the Seller
Representative in connection with such rescission or restoration referenced
in _Section_ __ _ 11.21(c)_, and (ii) in connection with the successful
enforcement of the rights of the other Parties, as the case may be, under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.21_, which amounts shall be in addition to all other
obligations hereunder. If any of the other Parties are required to refund part
or all of any payment of the Purchaser with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, such payment shall not constitute a release of Parent from any
liability hereunder and Parents liability hereunder shall be reinstated to
the fullest extent allowed under applicable Laws and shall not be construed to
be diminished in any manner.

 

(e) _Representations and Warranties of Parent_. Parent represents and
warrants to the Company and the Sellers that: 

(i) Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (ii) Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution
and delivery of and performance by Parent under this Agreement have been duly
authorized and approved by all requisite corporate action by Parent and no
other corporate action on the part of Parent is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of and performance by Parent under this Agreement. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other Parties,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception.

 

(iii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, nor
compliance by Parent with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (A)
materially conflict with or materially violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent, or other organizational or
governing documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement, (B) assuming that each of the consents,
authorizations and approvals referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ (and any
condition precedent to any such consent, authorization or approval has been
satisfied) and each of the filings referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ are
made and any applicable waiting periods referred to therein have expired,
violate any Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (C) result
in any material breach of, or constitute a material default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any Contract to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except, in the case of
clauses (B) and (C), as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on Parents ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(iv) Except for filings, approvals or deemed approvals required under, and
compliance with other applicable requirements of, FSMA and FCA Rules, no
consents or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations with, any
Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent, other than as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on
Parents ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

(v) Parent has, or will have as of Closing, access to sufficient funds to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, and Parent understands that,
under the terms of this Agreement, Parents obligations hereunder are not in
any way contingent or otherwise subject to (A) the consummation by Parent or
any of its Affiliates of any financing arrangements, (B) Parent or any of its
Affiliates obtaining any financing or (C) the availability of any financing to
Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

(vi) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to Parents
knowledge, threatened in writing against Parent at law or in equity, or
before or by any Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to,

ability to perform its obligations hereunder.
