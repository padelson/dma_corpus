provided that, Seller and Buyer will each be given credit for any Seller
Amounts or Buyer Amounts for which an adjustment was made to the Closing
Amount and which is reflected on _Schedule 7.02(a)_. The Post-Closing
Settlement Statement shall be based on actual revenues and expenses when
available and to the extent actual figures are not available estimates will be
used. In addition Buyer shall provide to Seller Buyers back up information
directly relied upon by Buyer in the preparation of the Post-Closing

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute

Statement or (B) in the event the amount in dispute is $5,000,000 or greater,

and (ii) each of Buyer and Seller shall within ten (10) Business Days after
the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to
such dispute in a written document of twenty pages or less and submit such
summaries to the Houston, Texas office of EY or such other Person as the
Parties may mutually select (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "), together with
the Dispute Notice, the Post-Closing 

---|---|--- 
 



7 desire to submit. Subject to Buyers obligation to pay at least $145,000,000
of the Post-Closing Payment pursuant to  _subclause (i)(B_ ) of this _Section
3.02(c)_, amounts in dispute related to Sellers indemnification obligations
shall be resolved in accordance with Article VIII and all other disputed
amounts set forth on the Dispute Notice will be resolved in accordance with
this _Section 3.02_ in either case without prejudice to the Party retaining,
or receiving, the Post-Closing Payment. Within twenty (20) Business Days after
receiving the Parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position
with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the
materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and
will be enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting Arbitrators shall be borne one-
half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. In the event that EY declines to serve
as the Accounting Arbitrator and the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon
its replacement within 10 days following the date upon which EY provides
notice that it will not serve as Accounting Arbitrator, then each Party will
nominate a candidate to be the Accounting Arbitrator, and such candidates so
nominated by the Parties shall together determine the Accounting Arbitrator.
Upon the final determination by the Accounting Arbitrator the applicable
Party shall pay to the other Party the amount determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator with respect to such dispute after taking into account any
adjustments already made to the Post-Closing Payment with respect to such
disputed amount. Such payment shall be by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the relevant Party. 
---|--- 
 



     | (d) | If a Party receives any proceeds or pays any additional
expenses (including any Property Expenses) for or on behalf of the other
Party, it shall promptly invoice the other Party for such expenses (who shall
promptly pay such invoice) or remit to the other Party the proceeds received
(to the extent such amounts had not been previously accounted for on or before
the Post-Closing Payment Date).

undivided fractional interest of not less than the "Net Revenue Interest" set

Revenue Interest_ ") produced from or attributable to the Leases, Lands and

mean the person or persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to
such Damages by another Party pursuant to this _Article_ VIII. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | To make a claim for indemnification, an Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under this _Section_ 8.05
including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for
its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based on a claim by a third party against the Indemnified
Party (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim
and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the
Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice of a
Claim as provided in this  _Section_ 8.05 shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under _Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ except to the extent
such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the
claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the case of a claim for indemnification based on a Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies
its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party. 
---|---|--- 
 



20 have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and
expense, the Claim. Subject to the terms of this _Section 8.05_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest (provided that the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Party may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 8.05(d)_. An Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle any
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto (i) that
does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) that provides for any relief
binding on any Indemnified Party other than monetary damages which will
be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party or (iii) in any manner that may
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result
of money damages covered by the indemnity). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or
admits its liability but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior
to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has
not yet admitted its liability for a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall send
written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10 days following receipt of
such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability for the Claim and (ii) if
liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed
settlement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | In the case of a claim for indemnification not based on a
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its liability for
such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30-day period that it
has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the
claim for such Damages shall conclusively be deemed to have been disputed. 
---|---|--- 

Section 8.06. _Limitations on Indemnity_.



     | (a) | The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnity under this _Article_ VIII shall be reduced by the amount
of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Party or its
affiliates with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and
excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the
Indemnified Party or its affiliates). 
---|---|--- 
 



21 compensation for the same Damages under this Agreement, even if it is entitled
to indemnification under more than one Section of this _Article_ VIII.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Except for claims for indemnity pursuant to _Section
8.02(a)(ii)-(v)_ , no Party shall have any right to indemnification hereunder
for any claim for which the Damages incurred by a Party do not exceed
Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00); provided that a Party may aggregate
all claims for an individual Lease to reach such amount (the " _Individual
Claim Threshold_ "). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Buyer shall have no right to indemnification hereunder
except to the extent the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by Buyer and
subject to indemnification under this _Article_ VIII exceed one and three-
quarter percent (1.75%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Claim
Deductible_ "), after which all such amounts exceeding the Aggregate Claim
Deductible shall be subject to indemnification hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnification or claims
relating to or arising under (i) _Section 8.02(a)(iii)-(v)_ , (ii) breaches
of Sellers representations in Sections _4.01(a_ ),  _4.01(b_ ), _4.01(c_ ),
_4.01(d_ ), _4.01(e_ ), _4.01(f_ ), _4.01(g_ ), _4.01(h_ ), _4.01(i_ ), and
_4.01(o_ ) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), (iii) taxes
under _Section _ 9.01, (iv) adjustments to the Purchase Price after Closing
or (v) _Section 3.02(d)_ , shall in each case be without regard to the
Individual Claim Threshold or Aggregate Claim Deductible. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | The indemnity obligations set forth in this _Article VIII_
shall survive the Closing and termination of this Agreement; provided however,
that other than (i) the Fundamental Representations, and (ii) Sellers
indemnity obligations under _Section 8.02(a)(ii)-(v)_ , which shall survive
indefinitely, all representations and warranties of Seller hereunder shall
expire, and Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer in respect
thereof on or after twelve (12) months after the Closing, provided that there
shall be no termination of any bona fide claim for Damages asserted pursuant
to this _Article VIII_ with respect to such a representation or
warranty prior to its expiration date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Other than in respect of breaches of Fundamental
Representations, the Special Warranty of Title, taxes allocable to Seller
under _Section 9.01_ , and any claim brought under _Section 8.02(a)(iii)-(iv)_
,  _Section 10.03_ or _Section 3.02(d_ ) hereof, Sellers maximum aggregate
indemnity obligation hereunder shall not exceed, in any event, twenty percent
(20%) of the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 
 



22 Section 8.07. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to the Special
Warranty in the Assignment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, this _Article VIII_ and _Section 10.12_ contain the
Parties exclusive remedies against each other with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and the Parties acknowledge and agree
that the remedies available in this _Article VIII_ supersede any other
remedies at Law or in equity.

 

ARTICLE IX.

 

 _POST-CLOSING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS_

 

Section 9.01. _Taxes and Recording Fees_. All required documentary, filing and
recording fees and expenses in connection with the filing and recording of
the assignments, conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to
the Property to Buyer shall be borne by Buyer. The Parties anticipate that the
transfer of the Property to Buyer will not be subject to Texas sales and use
tax, either (i) pursuant to Texas Tax Code § 151.306 as an exempt transfer of
property jointly owned by both Buyer and Seller prior to the transfer, or (ii)
as a nontaxable transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the
transfer of real property. The Parties shall cooperate in documenting the
nontaxability of the transfer (including, as appropriate, the exchange of
properly completed exemption certificates or other substantiation), and
Seller shall not collect Texas sales and use tax from Buyer in connection
with the transfer. Seller shall be allocated and shall bear and pay all taxes
(other than Income Taxes) for any period or portion thereof ending prior to
the Effective Time, and Buyer shall be allocated and bear all taxes (other
than Income Taxes) for any period or portion thereof that begins at or after
the Effective Time. Each Party shall be responsible for its own Income Taxes.
For purposes of allocating taxes between the period before the Effective Time
and the period on and after the Effective Time, (i) all taxes that are
attributable to the severance or production of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated
to the period in which the severance or production giving rise to such taxes
occurred, (ii) taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or
imposed on a transactional basis (other than Income Taxes or such taxes
described in clause (i)), shall be allocated to the period in which
the transaction giving rise to such taxes occurred, and (iii) taxes that are
ad valorem, property or other taxes imposed on a periodic basis shall be
allocated by prorating each such tax based on the number of days in the
applicable period that occur before the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such period that occur on
or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. Each
Party shall indemnify and make payments to the other Party as necessary so as
to cause each Party to bear responsibility for their share of taxes as
allocated under this _Section_ 9.01 within thirty (30) days of written demand
therefor.

 

ARTICLE X.

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 10.01. _Confidentiality_. From Closing and for a period of two (2)
years after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by law the Parties
shall keep, and shall cause their affiliates and its and their respective
members, managers, officers, employees, agents, and representatives to keep
confidential all information (whether written or oral) received from the
other with respect to the Properties, which would be deemed to be confidential
information under the Applicable Joint Operating Agreements, unless such
information is readily ascertainable from public or published information or
trade sources or is received from a third person having no obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information. Should any person take legal
action to compel

 



23  either Party (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information
or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or otherwise) to disclose
any of such information, such Party shall provide the other Party with prompt
notice thereof so that such Party may, if it so desires, seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy (including participation in any such
proceeding). In any event, any such Party required to produce
such information will furnish only that portion of such information as is
legally or upon the advice of counsel required and will exercise its best
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may
disclose such information to its employees, officers, representatives or
advisers who have a need to know such information for the purpose of carrying
out the Partys obligations under this Agreement and who are subject to
similar confidentiality restrictions. The Parties hereby acknowledge that they
are aware, that the United States securities laws prohibit any Person who has
material, non-public information concerning the matters which are the subject
of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities of either Party or
from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in
which it is reasonably foreseeable that such Person is likely to purchase or
sell such securities. The Parties agree that they will not use or cause any
other Person to use any non-public information concerning the matters which
are the subject of this Agreement in contravention of applicable law.

 

Section 10.02. _Press Releases_. No information in connection with this
Agreement shall be released to the public by either Party, including, without
limitation, through press releases, without the express written permission of
the other Party, unless required by applicable federal, state or local laws,
or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or self-regulatory
organization governing an affiliate of Buyer or in connection with such
affiliates investor communication practices. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that Buyer will issue a press release at signing and at Closing. Buyer
will allow Seller to review and comment on the draft press release, but the
final text of the press release will be determined by Buyer.

 

Section 10.03. _Like-Kind Exchange_. Buyer shall cooperate fully, to the
extent reasonably requested by Seller, in connection with accommodating an
exchange as provided for under Section 1031 or similar section of the Code and
any corresponding state income tax provision ("Like-Kind Exchange"). Seller
reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to assign its rights under this
Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchase Price, and that
portion of the Purchased Interests associated therewith, to a qualified
intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) to accomplish this transaction, in whole or in part,
in a manner that will comply with the requirements of a Like-Kind Exchange.
Buyer hereby (a) consents to Sellers assignment of its rights in
this Agreement with respect to the Like-Kind Exchange Assets and (b) if such
an assignment is made, agrees to transfer all or a portion of the Closing
Amount, or the Post-Closing Payment, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement,
into the qualified trust account at Closing, or on the date the Post-Closing
Payment is made, as applicable, as directed in writing by Seller; provided
that the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by reason of the Like-Kind
Exchange. Seller acknowledges and agrees that a whole or partial assignment
of this Agreement to a qualified intermediary shall not release Seller from
any of its respective liabilities and obligations to Buyer or expand any
liabilities or obligations of Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in
its purchase of the Assets if such costs are the result of Sellers Like-Kind
Exchange, and Seller shall indemnify 

 



24  Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Claims arising from Sellers Like-Kind
Exchange without regard to the Individual Claim Threshold or Aggregate Claim
Deductible. No representations are made that any particular tax treatment
will be given to either party as a result of the Like-Kind Exchange.

Section 10.04.  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
all fees, costs, and expenses incurred by any Party hereto in negotiating this
Agreement or in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the Party incurring the same, including, without limitation,
legal, engineering and accounting fees, costs, and expenses.

 

Section 10.05. _Notices_. All notices and communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing, and any such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if personally
delivered, or if mailed by registered or certified mail, postage and
certification charges prepaid, or sent by a nationally recognized commercial
delivery service, charges prepaid, addressed as follows:

Section 10.06. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement will apply to, be
binding in all respects on, and inure to the benefit of the permitted
successors and assigns of the Parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any person other than the Parties to
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein, any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement, and other agreements
contemplated herein, and all provisions and conditions hereof and thereof are
for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and such
other agreements and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.07. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties
hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original instrument for all purposes and all of which together shall

Section 10.08. _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution_.



      | (a) | This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of
the State of Texas, without regard to any conflict of law provisions thereof
which may refer the subject matter to another jurisdiction. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

If a dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement, or the interpretation
or breach thereof (a " _Dispute_ "), and such Dispute cannot be settled
through good faith negotiation or consultation between the Parties then the
Dispute shall be finally decided by resort of either Party to arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "), now in effect, except to the extent
modified herein. The arbitration shall be before three arbitrators appointed
as set forth in this _Section 10.08(b)_. Each Party hereto shall appoint one
arbitrator and within ten (10) days after the appointment of the last of such
two arbitrators, the two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator. If
either Party or the two arbitrators fail to timely appoint an arbitrator, then
said arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. The place of arbitration will
be Houston, Texas. The rules of evidence of the State of Texas shall govern
the discovery and presentation of evidence in any arbitration hearing. The
Parties will submit true copies of all documents considered relevant with
their respective statement of claim or defense and any counterclaim or reply.
Neither Party may compel the other to produce additional documents. The
maximum number of witnesses each Party may call to give evidence is three
witnesses of fact and two expert witnesses. The arbitrators shall not have the
power to award, 

---|---|--- 
 



26 consequential damages (however denominated). Each Party will bear its own
costs of legal representation and witness expenses. The arbitrators must
render a reasoned award in writing. The Dispute will be resolved as quickly as
possible. The arbitration award must be issued within three months from
completion of the hearing, or as soon as possible thereafter. The
arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties and judgment on
the award rendered may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction
thereof. The provisions of this _Section 10.08(b)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes; provided, however, a
Party, without prejudice to the mandatory procedures of this _Section
10.08(b)_ , may file a complaint for purposes of tolling the statute of
limitations, or seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial
relief, if in its sole judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable
damage. Notwithstanding such action, the Parties will continue to participate
in good faith in the procedures specified in this _Section 10.08(b)_. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
LOCATED IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM
FOR PURPOSES OF ENTERING ANY JUDGMENT OR AWARD OF THE ARBITRATORS OR AS
ALLOWED PURSUANT TO _SECTION 10.08(B)_ , AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AGREES THAT ALL SUCH MATTERS MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH MATTERS BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE
OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH MATTERS. EACH PARTY AGREES
THAT A JUDGMENT REGARDING ANY SUCH MATTER MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER
JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 10.09. _Company and Other Documents_. The Parties hereto agree to
furnish to each other, as applicable, all company and other documents,
certificates, and other instruments relating to the transactions contemplated
herein as may reasonably be required.

 

Section 10.10. _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement may not be amended nor any
rights hereunder be waived except by an instrument in writing signed by the
Party to be charged with such amendment or waiver. The headings of the
articles and sections of this Agreement are for

 



27  convenience and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions of
this Agreement. References in this Agreement to Articles, Sections,
subsections, Exhibits, and Schedules shall be deemed to refer to Articles,
Sections, and subsections of and Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement,

liability company, trust, estate or Governmental Authority. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) constitutes the entire
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, superseding all negotiations, prior discussions, and prior agreements
and understandings relating to such subject matter. Except as otherwise
expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement is not for the benefit of
any third person. The Parties acknowledge that they and their respective
counsel have negotiated and drafted this Agreement jointly and agree that the
rule of construction which states that ambiguities are to be resolved against
the drafting Party shall not be employed in the interpretation or
construction of this Agreement.

Section 10.11. _Integration_. This Agreement, including the exhibits attached
hereto, is fully integrated and represents the entire Agreement and
understanding of the Parties. This Agreement shall supersede and replace any
prior agreements or understanding between the Parties concerning the subject
matter of this Agreement. Each of the Parties expressly waives reliance on
any facts, promises, undertakings, or representations made by any other Party
or such Partys representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement to
the extent such facts, promises, undertakings, or representations are not
expressly reflected herein.

Section 10.12. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and the Parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and immediate
injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy available at Law or in
equity.

Section 10.13. _Severability_ __. __If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be
affected or impaired thereby and (b) the Parties shall endeavor in good faith
negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
