ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.01, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, on
or before the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the date of the
initial public announcement of this Agreement, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")) the Offer.

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to
the terms and the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_
below) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ")
(without limiting the right of Merger Sub to terminate, extend or modify the
Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement). On the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Tendered
Shares_ ") as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date (as defined
below) and in compliance with applicable Law (as defined below). The
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and
the date and time at which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_." Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to Merger Sub on the date of the Offer Closing funds necessary to
purchase and pay the Cash Consideration for any and all Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer and
this Agreement.

 

(c) The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
and Parent and Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition
at any time and from time to time, in their sole and absolute discretion,
other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
only with the prior written consent of the 

 



-2-  Company. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of
the Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer;  _provided_ that, unless otherwise
provided in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of
Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) impose conditions on the
Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or amend any Offer Condition, (iv)
waive or amend the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any other term of the Offer
in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares, or (vi) extend the
Expiration Date (as defined below) except as required or permitted by _Section
1.01(e)_.

 

(d) On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, file with the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which Tender Offer
Statement shall include an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, summary
advertisement and other required ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO
and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
") and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Shares
as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company hereby consents
to the inclusion of the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") in the Offer Documents. Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the Offer Documents to
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub
all information concerning the Company and the holders of Shares that may be
required to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.01(d)_, including
communication of the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.
Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments
(and shall orally describe any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior
to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the
Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any such SEC comments.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents,
the Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of
the 20th business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.01(e)_ calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)

 



-3-  after the date that the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Date_
") or, if the period of time for which the Offer is open shall have been
extended pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 1.01(e)_ or as
may be required by applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to
which the Offer has been extended in accordance with this _Section 1.01(e)_,
the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the
then-effective Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for successive periods of not more than ten (10) Business
Days each (as defined below) (the length of such period to be determined by
Merger Sub), or for such longer period as the parties may agree, in order to
permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that the Offer shall not be extended pursuant to this
_clause (i)_ if all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived), and
(ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or necessary to resolve any
comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer
Documents; _provided_ that, in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , Merger
Sub shall not in any event be required to, and without the Companys
prior written consent shall not, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as
defined below). Nothing in this _Section 1.01(e)_ shall be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day of such termination) terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

 

(f) At or prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent will authorize and duly adopt,
execute and deliver, and will ensure that a duly qualified Rights Agent
executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement, subject to any reasonable revisions
to the CVR Agreement that are requested by such Rights Agent ( _provided_ that
such revisions are not, individually or in the aggregate, detrimental to any
CVR holder).

Section 1.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC (and in any event file
within three (3) Business Days after the Offer Documents are filed), a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_ ") that contains the Company Board Recommendation, the fairness opinion
of the Companys financial advisor referenced in _Section 4.21_ and the
notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the Corporation
Law, and shall promptly disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Law, including by setting
the Stockholder List Date (as defined below) as the record date for the
purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
Corporation Law. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to
form in all material respects 

 



-4-  with the requirements of applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required
or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with any written comments (and
shall orally describe any oral comments) that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of
the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the
SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall give
reasonable consideration to any comments provided by Parent or Merger Sub. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC
comments.

 

(b) The Company shall reasonably promptly after the date hereof provide to
Parent, or cause to be provided to Parent, a list of the holders of Shares as
well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing
the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date and shall
promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance
(including updated lists of the record and beneficial holders of
Shares, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or
its agents may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the
holders of Shares (the date of the list used by Parent to determine the
Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Except as required by
applicable Law, and except as necessary to communicate regarding the Offer and
the Merger with the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is
terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such
information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the
possession of their representatives.

 

(c) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

Law to make the Merger effective. Prior to the filing referred to in 
_Section 2.01_ and this _Section 2.02_, as soon as practicable following the

ARTICLE III

CONSIDERATION; PAYMENT FOR SHARES AND OPTIONS

Section 3.01 _Conversion of Shares; Cancellation of Treasury Shares and
Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or held in the treasury of the
Company, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which shall
have only those rights set forth in Section 3.08) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders thereof, be converted automatically at the Effective Time into
the right to receive (a) in cash an amount per Share equal to the Cash
Consideration (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) and (b) one (1) CVR
subject to and in accordance with the CVR Agreement in each case, without any
interest thereon (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the
surrender of the Certificates (as defined below) or Book-Entry Shares (as
defined below), as applicable, in accordance with this Article III. At
the Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares (in each case representing such Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is at such time owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of
the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be canceled and
shall cease to exist at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

Section 3.02 _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof,
be converted at the Effective Time into and become one (1) share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.03 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make the aggregate payments of the Cash
Consideration due pursuant to  _Section 3.01(a)_ (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "), which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall not include the Merger Consideration payable with respect to
Company Options and Company 

 



-7-  Restricted Stock. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of
the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (x) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Cash Consideration payable to
the holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement, (y) following any such
losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the aggregate Cash Consideration
that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Paying Agent to the extent of such insufficiency, and (z) such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall be paid solely to Parent. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.01_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall (x) be
paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable
withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Cash Consideration and
(y) shall receive in exchange therefor one (1) CVR for each Share represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with and subject to the
terms of the CVR Agreement, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash
Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below) other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer. From and after the
Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 3.03, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing any Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares
evidenced by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon.

 

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such

 



-8-  reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the Shares formerly represented thereby.

 

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares who have not complied with this Section
3.03 prior to the end of such six (6) month period shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation but only as general creditors thereof for payment
of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws). None of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such
Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) All cash paid and CVRs provided upon the surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been paid and given in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 

Section 3.04 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this _Article III_.

Section 3.05 _Company Options and Company Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised stock option to purchase Shares (collectively,
the " _Company Options_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys Stock Incentive
Plan or the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the " _Company Stock Plans_
"), shall vest in full, and automatically be canceled and terminated as of
the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall become entitled to receive
(i) an amount of cash, if any, from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (A) the total number of Shares underlying such Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the
excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per Share of
such Company Option and (ii) one (1) CVR for each Share underlying such
Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each
case without interest and subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes
required by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with  _Section
3.06_.

 



-9- (b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding share of restricted stock awarded pursuant to any Company Stock
Plan (the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall automatically become fully
vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and each such share of
Company Restricted Stock shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive (i) an amount in cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the Cash
Consideration and (ii) one (1) CVR, in each case without interest and subject
to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 3.06_.

 

(c) Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make payments of the
cash consideration payable with respect to Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock pursuant to clause (i) of Sections 3.05(a) and 3.05(b) to all
holders of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock, as applicable, as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, and (ii) provide, or cause to be
provided, to the Surviving Corporation sufficient funds to make such payments.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that payments in respect of Company Restricted
Stock pursuant to Section 3.05(b) as to which the election contemplated by
Section 83(b) of the Code has been properly made shall not be subject to any
deductions in respect of withholding Taxes.

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to terminate
each of the Company Stock Plans and to effectuate all of the
actions contemplated by this _Section 3.05_, contingent on the Closing of
the Merger.

Section 3.06 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, the CVR Agreement or
otherwise, such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 3.07 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, during the
period between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; provided,
that in any case, nothing in this Section 3.07 shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 3.08 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who are properly
demanding appraisal rights pursuant to, and who are complying in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the "
_Dissenting_

 



-10-   _Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to the holders of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Corporation Law, unless and
until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under Section 262 of the
Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section
262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such
holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only
for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time
that such right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or
expired, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares (or written threats thereof), withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Shares, and (b) the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or
settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.09 _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with _Section
2.02_ as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing without a meeting of
the Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the Corporation
Law. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to
continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the
Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of the Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the
intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable
to continue, vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF THE COMPANY

Except (a) as set forth in the section or subsection, as applicable, of
_Article IV_ of the disclosure letter dated the date hereof and delivered by
the Company to Parent with respect to this Agreement prior to the execution
hereof (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") that specifically corresponds to such
Section or subsection, as applicable, of this  _Article IV_ (or in any other
section of _Article IV_ of the Disclosure Letter if the applicability of such
disclosure to such Section or subsection, as applicable, of this _Article IV_
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure) or (b) as disclosed

 



-11-  in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by
the Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC (including
items incorporated by reference therein) since January 1, 2013 and publicly
available prior to the date hereof (the " _Filed SEC Documents_ ") (excluding
any disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward
Looking Statements" or similarly titled captions and any other disclosures
contained therein to the extent that they are cautionary or forward-looking in
nature ( _provided_ that this _clause (b)_ shall not be applicable to
_Section 4.02_ and  _Section 4.03_), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that the following are true and correct:

 

Section 4.01 _Organization, Qualification and Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own or lease its properties and conduct its business as
currently conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which
the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of the business transacted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except to the extent the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and
all organizational and governing documents of each of its Subsidiaries (and
all amendments thereto) as currently in effect. All the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of
the Company have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights and are wholly owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens. No
Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of Common Stock or other equity
interests in the Company.

Section 4.02 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("
_Common Stock_ "), and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share (" _Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on October 1,
2014 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (a) 26,790,203 shares of Common Stock
were issued and outstanding; (b) no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; (c) no shares of Common Stock were held by the Company in its
treasury; and (d) an aggregate of 4,066,083 shares of Common Stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards and rights under the
Company Stock Plans, of which 4,062,867 shares of Common Stock
were underlying outstanding and unexercised Company Options and 3,216 shares
of Common Stock were underlying unvested awards of Company Restricted Stock.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, at the close of business on the

complete list of (i) all Third-Party IP Licenses, (ii) all agreements under
which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has licensed or sublicensed
to any other Person the right to use any Company Material IP, (iii) all
agreements that contain covenants not to sue with respect to any Company

-23- (c) As of the date hereof, no cancellation, interference, opposition,
reissue, reexamination or other similar proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the validity, enforceability,
scope or ownership of any Company Registered IP, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Exclusively Licensed Registered IP, is being contested or
challenged (other than office actions or similar communications issued by any
Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of prosecution of any pending
applications for registration of any such Company Registered IP). To the
Knowledge of the Company, each of the patents and patent applications included
in the Company Registered IP and the Exclusively Licensed Registered IP
claiming the Key Product identifies by name each inventor of the
claims thereof as determined in accordance with applicable Law of the
jurisdiction in which such patent is issued or such patent application is
pending. As of the date hereof, (i) all registration, renewal, maintenance and
other similar payments that are or have become due with respect to (A) any
Company Registered IP (including the Key Patents) and (B) any Exclusively
Licensed Registered IP, to the extent the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is responsible for the prosecution or maintenance of such Exclusively
Licensed Registered IP or the costs thereof (together with the Company
Registered IP, the " _Company Managed IP_ "), in each case have been timely
paid by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and
(ii) the Company Managed IP which is owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company and the Exclusively Licensed Registered IP is, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the other Company Managed IP which is exclusively
licensed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is, subsisting and
is, to the Knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable and in full force
and effect and has not lapsed (except for any patents within the Company
Managed IP having lapsed or expired at the end of their statutory term), been
abandoned, been disclaimed, been cancelled or been forfeited, except in each
case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ for such exceptions as have not resulted
in, or would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial
or otherwise) on the Key Product.

 

(d) Either the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company solely and exclusively
owns all right, title and interest in and to the Owned Company IP and holds a
valid and enforceable written license to use all Licensed Company IP, in each
case, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and any rights
of any third party where such license is exclusive and, immediately following
the Effective Time, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company will have the
same rights thereto as it had prior to the Effective Time, except, in each
case, as individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing is not a representation of non-
infringement, non-misappropriation or other non-violation of the Intellectual
Property of another Person. Since January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company has received a written notice from any third party
(including any employee or consultant) pursuant to which such third party
claims to own or have any right or interest in or to, or to have any right to
receive any royalty or other material payment for the Companys or its
Subsidiaries use or exploitation of, any Company Material IP. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries owns, or holds a valid and enforceable written
license or other right to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for, used
in or held for use in the conduct of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business as currently conducted, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company Material IP is all the Intellectual

 



-24-  Property necessary to conduct the Companys business as currently conducted
or develop, manufacture and commercialize the Key Product in the United States
and European Union, except for such exceptions as have not resulted in, and
would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial
or otherwise) on the Key Product; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing is not a representation of non-infringement, non-misappropriation or
other non-violation of the Intellectual Property of another person. To the
Knowledge of the Company, all assignments made to the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company for any Company Material IP are valid and
enforceable and have been recorded in compliance with applicable Law.

 

(e) None of the Company Material IP which is owned or purported to be owned by
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, none of the Exclusively Licensed
Registered IP, and, to the Knowledge of Company, none of the other Company
Material IP which is licensed pursuant to any Third Party IP Licenses, is
subject to any pending or outstanding injunction, directive, order, decree,
award, settlement, judgment or other disposition of dispute that would
reasonably be expected to adversely restrict the use, transfer, registration
or licensing of any such Company Material IP by the Company or any of its
Affiliates (or Parent and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time),
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the validity, enforceability or scope of any such Company
Material IP, except for such exceptions as have not resulted in, and would
not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise)
on the Key Product. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has
received notice from any Person requesting the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company to (nor does the Company have any reason to believe that it or any
of its Subsidiaries will be required to) indemnify, defend or hold harmless
such Person with respect to any losses resulting from or arising from the
Company Material IP.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, during the last five (5) years, the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it has been
conducted has not and, as currently conducted, does not, infringe,
misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property owned by
another Person, except as has not resulted in and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key
Product. During the last five (5) years, (i) no Legal Proceeding has been
asserted or pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company relating to any
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of
another Person by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company except as has
not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product and (ii) neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has received any written notice
(including any written offers to license) alleging any infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of another Person
by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company except as has not resulted in
and would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the 

 



-25-  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact
(commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product. To the Knowledge of the Company,
none of the Company Material IP is subject to any pending or outstanding
injunction, directive, order, decree, award, settlement or judgment that would
reasonably be expected to restrict the ownership, use, validity,
enforceability or scope of any such Intellectual Property.

 

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, no other Person has, since November 4,
2009, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Company Material
IP, except as has not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product. 

(h) Each Person (including employees, consultants and third parties) who is or
was involved in the creation or development of any Company Material IP which
is owned or purported to be owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing an assignment of
the applicable Intellectual Property to the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company and reasonable confidentiality provisions protecting such Company
Material IP which, to the Knowledge of the Company, has not been breached by
such Person. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken
commercially reasonable actions to maintain the confidentiality of the
information held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or the
applicable licensor, or purported to be held by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company, which it deems a Trade Secret. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no Trade Secrets included in the Company Material IP have been disclosed to or
used by any Person except pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement which, to the
Knowledge of the Company, has not been breached by any such Person.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Entity or any university, college, research institute or
other educational institution has been used to create any Company Material IP,
except for any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that has not
resulted in such Governmental Entity or institution obtaining any rights of
ownership, license or use of such Company Material IP.

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely affect, any rights of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in any Intellectual Property,
(ii) grant or require the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to grant
to any Person any rights with respect to any Company Material IP, (iii)
subject the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to any increase in
royalties or other payments in respect of any Intellectual Property, (iv) by
the terms of any agreement to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party, diminish any royalties or other payments the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company would otherwise be entitled to in respect
of any Intellectual Property or (v) result in the breach or, by the terms of
such agreement, termination of any agreement relating to Intellectual
Property, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product.

 



-26- (k) The Key Patents are subsisting and valid and enforceable and in full
force and effect and have not lapsed and there is no information, materials,
facts or circumstances, including any information or fact which would,
constitute prior art to any of the Key Patents, or that would, render any of
the Key Patents not subsisting or invalid or unenforceable or not in full
force and effect or that would result in the lapsing of any of the Key
Patents.

 

Section 4.15 _Real Property_.

 

(a) The Company does not own any real property.

 

(b) _Section 4.15(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of all leases, subleases and other agreements under which the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company uses or occupies or has the right to
use or occupy, now or in the future, any real property (the " _Real Property
Leases_ "). The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all Real Property Leases (including all modifications,
amendments, supplements, waivers and side letters thereto). Except for matters
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Real

Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), all rent and other sums and charges payable
by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as tenant thereunder are

Section 6.02 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and employees not to
and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission or announcement of
any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or would reasonably be
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal (as defined below), (ii) provide
any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any Person or group who has made or would reasonably be expected to make
any Takeover Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with respect to any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve,
support, adopt, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal, (iv) take any
action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation (including any transaction under, or a third
party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the
Corporation Law) inapplicable to any Person other than Parent and its
Affiliates or to any transactions constituting or contemplated by a Takeover
Proposal, (v) otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in any such
inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations, or (vi) resolve or
agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers and employees to and shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives

 



-41-  to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person or groups that may be
ongoing with respect to any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal
and immediately terminate access by any such Person or group to any physical
or electronic data rooms relating to a potential Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly after the date hereof request each Person (if any)
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a Takeover Proposal or potential
Takeover Proposal to promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-public
documents and materials relating to the Takeover Proposal or to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses, operations or affairs
heretofore furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives to such Person or group or any of its representatives in
accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, and shall
enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Parents prior written
consent, any standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality,
standstill or other agreement with such Person; _provided_ that the Company
may waive any standstill or similar provisions to the extent necessary to
permit a Person or group to make, on a confidential basis to the
Company Board, a Takeover Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing to
disclosure of such Takeover Proposal to Parent, in each case as contemplated
by this _Section 6.02_ ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may only
take such action if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law). The Company shall not enter into any confidentiality
agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing to Parent the information required to be provided to Parent pursuant
to this _Section 6.02_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may in any event seek
to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by such Person or group that did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.02 solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as
defined below).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a
_bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.02_, and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action described in _clause (A)_ or  _(B)_ below would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person or group
making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ _,_ that (x) the Company shall substantially
concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company that is provided to (or given access to) any Person or group and
which was not previously provided to Parent and (y) the Company shall take
reasonable steps to safeguard any commercially sensitive non-public
information of the Company, in a manner reasonably consistent with the
Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information
in the context of considering Takeover Proposals, and (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that prior to or concurrently with the Company taking such actions as
described in _clauses (A)_ and/or _(B)_

 



-42-  above, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such
determination of the Company Board as provided for in _clause (ii)_ above,
together with the identity of the Person or group making such Takeover
Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing in the event that the Company, its
directors, officers or employees or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of its
other Representatives, receives any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal,
or any initial request for non-public information concerning the Company from
any Person or group who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any
Takeover Proposal, or any initial request for discussions or negotiations
related to any Takeover Proposal, and, in connection with such notice, provide
the identity of any person or group making such inquiry, proposal or offer,
the material terms and conditions thereof and the nature of such request, and
thereafter the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and
timely basis of the status and material details of discussions with respect
thereto, including any material changes to the terms thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent with copies of all
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, and
oral summaries of any oral requests, proposals or offers, received by the
Company or that the Company delivers to any Person or group making a Takeover
Proposal.

 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub),
or publicly propose to withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation or the
findings or conclusions of the Company Board referred to in Section 4.03(b),
(ii) approve or recommend the adoption of, or publicly propose to approve,
declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of, any Takeover
Proposal, (iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement, (iv) publicly propose or
announce an intention to take any of the foregoing actions, (v) following the
date any Takeover Proposal or any material modification thereto is first
made public or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail to
issue a press release stating that the Company Board Recommendation has not
changed within three (3) Business Days following Parents written request to
do so (which request may only be made once with respect to any such Takeover
Proposal and each material modification thereto), or (vi) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the
Companys stockholders (any action described in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ ,
_(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ or _(vi)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ", it being understood that a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board or any committee thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not, in and
of itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this _Section 6.02_, (1) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (2) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event (as defined
below); _provided_ , that (w) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action 

 



-43-  would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) in
the case of _clause (1)_ , the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the
applicable Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it
intends to accept or recommend such Superior Proposal, (y) the Company shall
have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four (4) Business Days
prior to taking the applicable action referred to in _clause (1)_ or _(2)_
of its intent to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including, in the case of _clause (1)_ , the terms and conditions of any
Superior Proposal that is the basis for the proposed Adverse Recommendation
Change and identity of any person or group making such Superior Proposal,
together with copies of any agreement to be entered into giving effect to
such Superior Proposal and any other material documents related thereto (a "
_Notice of Intended Recommendation Change_ "), and (z) the Company has
complied with the following additional covenants:

 

(i) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to clause (1)
above, and if desired by Parent, after providing any such Notice of Intended
Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its directors,
officers and employees to and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
during any such four (4) Business Day period regarding any proposal by Parent
to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (as
it may be extended pursuant to the following proviso) the Company Board again
makes the determinations described in clauses (w) and (x) with respect to such
Superior Proposal; provided, that, in the event that there is any material
amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision
in the amount, form or mix of consideration the Companys stockholders would
receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required
to provide Parent with notice of such material amendment and there shall be a
new two (2) Business Day period following such notification during which the
Company shall negotiate with Parent or otherwise comply again with the
requirements of this Section 6.02(e)(i) and the Company Board shall not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the end of any such period as so
extended; and

 

(ii) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to _clause
(2)_ above:

 

(1) such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made as a result of an event,
fact, development or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets
or operations of the Company (other than any event, fact, development or
occurrence resulting from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company)
that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board as of
the date hereof and becomes known to the Company Board after the date hereof
and prior to the Acceptance Time (an " _Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal or
any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof shall not constitute an
Intervening Event; and

 

(2) during any such four (4) Business Day period, if desired by Parent, the
Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers and employees to and

 



-44-  shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith during any such four
(4) Business Day period regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby
and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period the Company Board again
makes the determinations described in _clause (w)_ with respect to such
Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or otherwise violate its obligations
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Adverse Recommendation
Change may be made unless the Company shall have first complied with
its obligations in _Section 6.02(e)_.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer from any Person or group providing for (A) any direct or
indirect acquisition, purchase or license, in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more of the consolidated assets
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property and capital
stock of Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company, or (2) Shares or any
other Company Securities, which together with any other Shares or
other Company Securities beneficially owned by such Person or group, would
represent 20% or more of the outstanding Shares, (B) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group
owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding Shares, (C)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or group (or
the shareholders of any Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or
more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity
in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity or 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property and capital stock of
Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company, or (D) any reorganization,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, liquidation, dissolution or any
other similar transaction involving the Company, other than, in each case,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal received after
the date hereof that if consummated would result in a Person or group owning,
directly or indirectly, (A) more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or (B)
more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property and capital stock of Subsidiaries
of the Company), taken as a whole, in either case which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Offer
and the Merger, in each case taking into account the consideration, terms,
conditions, timing, financing terms and all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such Takeover Proposal (including the Person or group making
the Takeover Proposal) and of this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of this Agreement and the agreements contemplated hereby proposed by
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.02(e)_).

 



-45- Section 6.03 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, the Company will (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their
authorized officers, employees, accountants, investment bankers, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice) to such employees, plants, offices, warehouses and other
facilities at reasonable times and to such books, contracts, commitments and
records (including Tax Returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent
may reasonably request and instruct the Companys independent
public accountants to provide access to their work papers and such other
information as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent
and Merger Sub to make such inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii)
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time

each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company during such period pursuant to the requirements
of the federal or state securities Laws, and (v) use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in obtaining reasonable physical access to the
Manufacturing Facilities in order for Parent to make such inspections as it
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be obligated to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
the extent that, to do so (A) could reasonably be expected to jeopardize an
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection, or (B) would
violate an existing confidentiality obligation to any Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of _clause (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents to
provide such access, inspections, data or other information and take such
other action (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or
by providing such access, inspections, data or other information solely to
outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney-client privilege) as is
necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
Parent and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable Law, and otherwise the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and _provided_ that
the Company will have final authority over the form and content of all
submissions to and communications with the FDA, EMA or other similar
Governmental Entity, as applicable, the Company shall, subject to its
compliance with all applicable Laws, (i) promptly notify Parent in writing
of any significant data relating to the safety or effectiveness of the
Companys product DALVANCE (the " _Key Product_ "), including any information
that could lead to a recall of or a material labeling change to the Key
Product in the United States, (ii) reasonably consult with Parent in
connection with any proposed meeting with the FDA, EMA or any other comparable
Governmental Entity relating to the Key Product, (iii) promptly inform Parent
of, and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, and consider in good faith the views and comments of Parent prior to
submitting, any material filing, correspondence, or communication proposed to
be submitted to the FDA, the EMA or any other

 



-46-  comparable Governmental Entity relating to the Key Product, (iv) promptly
inform Parent of any material oral or written communication from or to the
FDA, the EMA or any comparable Governmental Entity relating to the Key
Product, and provide copies of any such written communication, (v) promptly
inform Parent of, and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment
on, any material change to the Key Product that would affect its regulatory
approval status, including material changes to the manufacturing plan or
process and marketing of the Key Product and (vi) otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of, and consider in good faith Parents views with
respect to, the status of the development and implementation of the launch of
the Key Product.

(c) All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 6.03_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i)
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall file within ten (10) Business
Days any required submissions under the HSR Act (unless Parent and the Company
mutually agree otherwise), and use its reasonable best efforts (A) to furnish
information required in connection with such submissions under the HSR Act
(including responding to any "second request" for additional information or
documentary material under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable
and advisable as mutually determined by Parent and the Company), (B) to
obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (C) to keep
the other parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such
submissions under the HSR Act, including with respect to: (1) the receipt of
any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the
expiration of any waiting period, (3) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended (the " _FTC Act_ " ), the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended (the
" _Clayton Act_ " ), or the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended (the "
_Sherman Act_ " ) and (4) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR Act, the FTC Act, the
Clayton Act or the Sherman Act with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (D) to obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances, expiration of
applicable waiting periods and approvals from any Governmental Entity and
(ii) the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with one another: (A)
in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be
made or any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other Contracts or
instruments that the Company is a party to or related to the Companys
business in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking
to obtain timely any such consents, permits, approvals or waivers. 

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others
of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
to such Person from a Governmental

 



-47-  Entity and permit the others to review and discuss in advance (and to
consider in good faith any comments made by the others in relation to) any
proposed substantive written communication to a Governmental Entity and (ii)
keep the others reasonably informed of any developments, requests for meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Offer or the Merger. The Company,
Parent and Merger Sub agree not to participate in any in-person meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed
transaction unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of _Section 1.01(d)_ and  _Section 1.02(a)_, not this _Section 6.04(b)_,
shall govern the matters covered therein.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that nothing herein shall require or be construed
to require Parent or Merger Sub, in order to obtain any required approval from
any Governmental Entity, to: (i) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of,
divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such action, (ii)
agree or consent to conduct of business restrictions, or (iii) propose,
negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any such sale,
leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, or divestiture, or holding separate,
or conduct of business restrictions before or after the Acceptance Time or the
Effective Time, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of Parents Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that Parent and
Merger Sub shall be required to undertake the actions described in clauses
(i) through (iii) to the extent (i) such actions are solely related to any
business, Person or division thereof, or any assets that Parent or its
Subsidiaries acquire or agree to acquire following the date hereof and (ii)
such actions are necessary to obtain the applicable consent, clearance,
approval, authorization or waiver under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate with each other, and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation,
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order that may result from such
litigation, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the
Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each
party hereto shall keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed, but only
to the extent that doing so would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
party, jeopardize any privilege of the party with respect thereto regarding
any such litigation, action or proceeding, it being agreed that each party
will also cooperate with the other parties to permit such inspection of or to
disclose such information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such
privilege with respect thereto. The Company shall cooperate fully with Parent
(and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to
cooperate fully with Parent) in connection with, and shall consult with and
permit Parent and its representatives to participate in, the defense of any
such litigation,

 



-48-  action or proceeding and the Company shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such litigation, action or proceeding;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be allowed to settle or enter
into any negotiations or settlement of any such litigation, action or
proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Global
Market to cause the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ Global Market by
the Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

 

Section 6.05 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") as provided in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, the organizational documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries or under any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Filed SEC
Documents filed at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof or
listed on Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect as
of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time, shall survive the Offer Closing and the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause to
be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective
Time, policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may take
the form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering the
Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys policies existing on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
for such insurance (which amount is set forth in _Section 6.05(b)_ of the
Disclosure Letter); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, if and to the extent available
commercially, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may purchase, in lieu of the insurance contemplated
by the preceding sentence, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the directors
and officers liability insurance policies on terms and conditions no less
favorable than the directors and officers liability insurance policies in
effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate
annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year shall not be in
excess of the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence.

 



-49- (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time that a Legal Proceeding (whether arising
before, at or after the Effective Time) has been commenced against such
Indemnified Person in respect of which such Person expects to seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.05_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.05_ shall continue in effect with respect to such Legal Proceeding
until the final disposition of such Legal Proceeding.

(d) This _Section 6.05_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and
fulfill all of the Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as subsequently amended in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, for the period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the earlier of (x) at least twelve (12) months following the
Effective Time and (y) December 31, 2015 (or, if earlier than clause (x) or
(y), the date of termination of the applicable Continuing Employee), it shall,
or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide each employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as of the Effective
Time, and each employee who continues as of the Effective Time to be employed
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with at least the same level of base salary or hourly
wage rate, as the case may be, that was provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing
Employee with other compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity
compensation, change-in-control benefits or enhancements to benefits
contemplated by this Agreement) that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate than either (at Parents discretion) (x) those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (y) those in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees that the
Surviving Corporation or other Affiliate employing the Continuing Employees
will pay such employees the bonus for 2014 at the target bonus level (or such
higher level as the performance with respect to that bonus provides), with
payment to be made in accordance with the Companys normal practices in
February 2015.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (solely for the
purposes of determining accrual of paid time off and, if service-based, any
severance) under the employee

 



-50-  benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by each Continuing Employee to the Company prior to the Effective
Time to be credited for all purposes (other than for purposes of determining
an accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan) to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar Plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in no event shall Continuing Employees be entitled to service credit to
the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

 

(d) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent
Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time; and
(ii) for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from and
after the Effective Time, (A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting
periods and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or
actively-at-work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable
Plan and (B) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or cause to be recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Plan during the portion of
the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such
Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit
Plan.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.06_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.06_, whether express or implied, (i)
shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.07 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the CVR Agreement, the
Support Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, including the acquisition of
Shares pursuant thereto, or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board, as applicable, shall take
all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger, the CVR Agreement,
the Support

 



-51-  Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act
to eliminate the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger, the CVR Agreement, the Support Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall
change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover
Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.08 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby is brought by any stockholder or other holder of any
Company Securities (whether directly or on behalf of the Company
or otherwise) against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any such litigation,
and the Company shall give due consideration to Parents advice with respect
to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company shall not settle or enter into any negotiations or settlement of
any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), except that
Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not
include full release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

 

Section 6.09 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party or any Subsidiary thereof
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or
regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or
submits, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance,
it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) to the
extent the content of any press release or other announcement has been made in
accordance with this  _Section 6.09_, no separate approval shall be required
in respect of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any
subsequent press release or other announcement, and (b) each party may,
without complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make
internal announcements to employees, to the extent that such statements are
not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section 6.09_ and do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.09_ shall not apply
to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with and related to an Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as
any public statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change is
made in compliance with _Section 6.02_.

 



-52- Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and until the
Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current
or former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of
the Company, unless prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or
modification, the compensation committee of the Company Board (each member of
which the Company Board determined is an "independent director" within the
meaning of the applicable NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director"
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

Section 6.12 _FIRPTA Certificate._ The Company shall deliver to Parent, at
the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the Closing Date, a properly completed
and executed certificate to the effect that the Shares are not a U.S. real
property interest (such certificate to be in the form required by Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)).

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation._ (a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and
accounting advisors to, provide to Parent such cooperation as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any third party
debt or equity financing for the purposes of financing the Offer and/or the
Merger, the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, and the other
transactions contemplated thereby (the " _Financing_ "), including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, and due
diligence sessions at times reasonably coordinated in advance thereof and (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for presentations, memoranda,
financial projections and similar documents to be used in connection with the
Financing; _provided_ , that (x) nothing herein shall require such cooperation
to the extent it would (1) interfere materially and unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (2) require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or
otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Acceptance
Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified and
(y) any documentation executed by the Company of any of its Subsidiaries shall
not become effective until the consummation of the Closing. Parent shall (1)

 



-53-  promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section 6.13_ and (2) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, personnel and
advisors (collectively, the " _Financing Indemnitees_ ") from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing or providing the
assistance contemplated by this _Section 6.13_, in each case other than to
the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by any Financing
Indemnitee (the obligations of Parent in this clause (2), the " _Financing
Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The Financing Cooperation Indemnity shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and any termination of this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time,
but in no event later than two (2) Business Days before the Acceptance Time, a
payoff letter with respect to the Credit Agreement, dated October 31, 2013,
among the Company, certain of the Companys Subsidiaries and PDL BioPharma,
Inc. (as amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
_Existing Loan Agreement_ "), which payoff letter shall substantially
provide (subject to customary exceptions) (x) that upon receipt of the payoff
amount set forth in the payoff letter at or prior to the Effective Time, the
respective indebtedness incurred thereunder and related instruments shall be
terminated and (y) that all Liens (and guarantees), if any, in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company
securing such Indebtedness, shall be, upon the payment of the amount set forth
in the payoff letter at or prior to the Effective Time (and, if applicable,
providing for letters of credit or cash collateral) be released and
terminated. At or prior to the Effective Time (but subject to the Effective
Time occurring), the Company shall pay off all amounts outstanding (including
related fees and expenses) under the Existing Loan Agreement (up to the extent
of cash available to the Company at such time).

 

(c) At the request of the Parent, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to
effect the payment of the promissory note, dated August 18, 2014, issued by
the Company to Pfizer, Inc. (the " _Pfizer Note_ "); _provided_ , that any
payment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the Pfizer
Note (i) shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time and
(ii) shall be limited to the extent of cash available to the Company at such
time.

Section 6.14  _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of (i)
any written notice or other communication received by such party from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Offer or the Merger, if the failure to obtain such consent
would reasonably be expected to materially affect the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and (ii) any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or Parent or any of
Parents Subsidiaries, that purport to materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or that make allegations that, if
true, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 



-54- (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained herein in any
material respect at any time during the term hereof and (ii) any failure of
the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each case if
and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably
be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
_paragraph (c)(iii)_ or _paragraph (c)(iv)_ of _Annex I_ to fail to be
satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer. For the avoidance of
doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 6.14(b)_ shall
not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the remedies available to the parties hereunder.

(c) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (i) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein in any
material respect at any time during the term hereof and (ii) any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure,
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). For the avoidance of doubt,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.14(c)_ shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the remedies available to the parties hereunder.

Section 6.15 _Performance of U.S. Services_. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Company shall cause its relevant Subsidiaries to enter into
the distributorship agreement in substantially the form previously made

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

 

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (with
any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if prior to the Acceptance Time any court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, injunction or decree, or taken any other action, in each case the
effect of which is to make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and such order, injunction, decree or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate under this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to perform in any material respect any covenants and agreements
of such party set forth in this Agreement has primarily caused such order,
injunction, decree or action;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before March 5, 2015 (" _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate under this _Section 8.01(c)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect
any covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement has
resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the
Outside Date;

 

(d) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall be any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations or warranties
set forth herein or the Company has failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth herein, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to the failure of any Offer Condition set forth in
_clauses (iii)_ or _(iv)_ of _paragraph (c)_ of _Annex I_ , and (ii) is not
capable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days
following Parents delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach
or failure to perform; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder such that the Company has the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_;

 

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall
be any breach or inaccuracy in any of Parents or Merger Subs
representations or warranties set

 



-56-  forth herein or Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth herein, which inaccuracy, breach or failure
to perform (i) would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Offer and the Merger), and (ii) is not capable of being cured or is not
cured within thirty (30) Business Days following the Companys delivery of
written notice to Parent of such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ that
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.01(e)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder such that
Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.01(d)_;

(f) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that any
of the following shall have occurred: (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change;

have been commenced and the Company shall not have publicly announced, within
five (5) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange
offer, that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;
or (iii) a material breach of the provisions of _Section 6.02_;

 

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
Board is permitted to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.02(e)_, in order to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal immediately
following or concurrently with such termination; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the concurrent payment of the Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be
a condition to the right of the Company to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.01(g)_; or 

(h) by the Company, if Merger Sub shall have failed to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the time
period specified in _Section 1.01(a)_.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _clause_   _(b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ or _(h)_ of this _Section 8.01_ shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with
_Section 9.05_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Offer and the Merger are abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.01_, this
Agreement, except for the provisions of the last sentence of _Section
1.02(b)_, _Section 6.03(c)_, the Financing Cooperation Indemnity, this
_Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ and Article IX (other than _Section 9.03_),
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the
part of any party or any of its respective directors, officers, stockholders,
employees, agents, consultants or representatives or any lender or other
provider of Financing to Parent. Nothing in this Agreement (including _Section
8.03(c))_ shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for fraud or
any Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means an intentional and willful
material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to perform, in
each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by a party with the
actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act
would cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



-57- Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses.

 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Fee (as defined below) if this
Agreement is terminated as follows:

 

(i) if (i) after the date hereof, a Takeover Proposal shall have become
publicly known, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, or (B) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_, and (iii) within nine (9) months of such termination, the
Company Board approves or recommends any Takeover Proposal (regardless of
when made), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement that provides for
any Takeover Proposal, or any Takeover Proposal is consummated, then, in any
such case, the Company shall pay to Parent (or a person designated by Parent
in writing) the Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business
Days of the earliest of the date any such Company Board approval or
recommendation is made, any such acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other definitive agreement is entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the date any such transaction is consummated. Solely
for purposes of this _Section 8.03(b)(i)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.02(g)_, except
that all references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to
"50%";

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds within one (1) Business Day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of
same day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) such termination.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication
even though the Fee may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.
Subject to _Section 8.02_, in the event Parent shall receive the Fee, the
receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for such
termination), 

 



-58-  and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination. If
the Company fails promptly to pay the Fee when due and payable pursuant to
this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an
action or other proceeding that results in an award against the Company for
such Fee, the Company shall pay Parents costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such action or
proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the Fee from the date
such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime
lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that following the Offer Closing, this
Agreement may not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger
Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. This Agreement may not be
amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (c) waive compliance by any
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.01 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This Section 9.01 shall not limit any covenant or
agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after
the Effective Time.

Section 9.02 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the
Support Agreement, the CVR Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the

among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
Support Agreement, the CVR Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement except that the restrictions on contact and
restrictions on disclosure (to the extent required to be included in SEC

 



-59-  filings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement solely for purposes of permitting
the actions contemplated hereby to be consummated. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any party (including by operation of law, by merger or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties;  _provided_ , that
Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations
to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent and/or to any parties providing
Financing pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of
such Financing), but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 9.03 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof

the Holder to provide any necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an

Holder two years after the applicable Milestone Payment Date (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which such Milestone Payment would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity under applicable
Law), any such Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither
Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of a
Milestone Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar legal requirement under applicable Law.

Holders remaining rights in a CVR by transferring such CVR to Parent without

Section 13.02 _Payment of Milestone Payments._

 

Parent shall duly and promptly deposit with the Rights Agent for payment to
the Holders the Milestone Payments, if any, in the manner provided for in
_Section 11.04_ and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



\- 14 - Section 13.03 _Efforts._

 

(a) Parent and each other applicable Selling Entity shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to: (i) commercialize and sell Delbavancin during the Net
Revenue Milestone Period; (ii) achieve the EMA Milestone; and (iii) (A)
complete the Companys existing Phase 3b clinical trial to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of a single dose of Dalbavancin infused in adult patients
with ABSSSI caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria (the " _Single Dose
Study_ "), as well as all activities related to completing the Single Dose
Study, filing the related supplemental New Drug Application and receiving the
required approvals to achieve the Single Dose Milestone, and (B) file and seek
approval for such applications for FDA Approval as are necessary to achieve
the Single Dose Milestone, including filing a supplemental "new
drug application" in respect of the Single Dose Milestone.

(b) Parent shall impose the foregoing obligations set forth in this Section
4.03 on each Selling Entity as applicable to such entity and as required for
Parent to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 13.04 _Net Revenue Audit Rights._

 

(a) _Delivery of Net Revenue Statement_. On or before February 1, 2017, Parent
shall cause to be delivered to the Rights Agent a Net Revenue Statement in
respect of the calendar year ended December 31, 2016. Upon the written request
of any Holder, the Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event no later than
five Business Days after such request, deliver to such Holder at its address
(as set forth in the CVR Register) a copy of any Net Revenue Statement
delivered by Parent to the Rights Agent pursuant to this Section 4.04(a).

 

(b) _Net Revenue Audit Rights_. (i) From and after delivery of the Net Revenue
Statement in connection with a Milestone Non-Achievement Certificate
delivered in respect of the Net Revenue Milestone, upon reasonable advance
written notice from the Acting Holders, Parent shall permit the Independent
Accountant, at Parents expense, to have access at reasonable times during
normal business hours to the books and records of Parent and its Affiliates as
may be reasonably necessary to evaluate and verify the accuracy of the Net
Revenue calculations set forth in the Net Revenue Statement and the
figures underlying such calculations; _provided_ that (x) the Acting Holders
(and the Independent Accountant) enter into customary confidentiality
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Parent with respect to the confidential
information of Parent or its Affiliates to be furnished pursuant to this
_Section 13.04_ and (y) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates. The Independent
Accountant shall disclose to the Acting Holders only whether the Net Revenue
Milestone Payment was due and such additional information directly related to
its findings. The Independent Accountant shall provide Parent with a copy of
all disclosures made to the Acting Holders. The fees and charges by the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by Parent or its Affiliates.

(c) If, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 4.04(b)_,
the Independent Accountant concludes that the Net Revenue Milestone Payment
should have been paid but was not paid when due, within sixty (60) days of the
date the Independent Accountant delivers to Parent the Independent
Accountants written report (the " _Shortfall Report_ "), Parent shall

 



\- 15 -  promptly deliver to the Rights Agent for payment to the Holders cash in an
aggregate amount equal to the amount of the Net Revenue Milestone Payment,
plus interest at the "prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal
from time to time, from when the Net Revenue Milestone Payment should have
been paid (if Parent had given notice of achievement of the Net Revenue
Milestone pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), as applicable, to the
date of actual payment (such amount including interest being the " _CVR
Shortfall_ "). The decision of such Independent Accountant shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders, shall be nonappealable and
shall not be subject to further review, absent manifest error.

Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, solely if

any Legal Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in the chancery courts of the

 



\- 19 -  State of Delaware or in any Federal court located in the State of Delaware,
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to

conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of this Agreement
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that this
Agreement be effected as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

date, as applicable, the " _Termination Date_ ").

Business Day, then, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any payment required to be made in respect of the CVRs on or prior
to such date need not be made on or prior to such date, but may be made on the
next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the
last day on which such Milestone Payment is due.

Section 15.13 _Construction._

 

(a) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "herewith" and words of similar
