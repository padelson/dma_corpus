obligations of each Group Company during  that period, would have constituted
a breach by that Group  Company of those provisions resulting in a loss of
US$20  million or more for the Group and of which the Purchaser has  served
written notice on Phoenix in accordance with this  Agreement before the Cut-
Off Date;   (e) as of the Cut-Off Date, the Company not having been
dissolved  (ontbonden) granted a (preliminary) suspension of payments 
((voorlopige) surseance van betaling verleend) or declared  bankrupt
(failliet verklaard), and no proceeding having been  commenced for its

continuing;  and   (f) no Material Adverse Change shall have occurred and
be  continuing immediately before the Cut-Off Date of which the  Purchaser
has served written notice on Phoenix in accordance  with this Agreement
before the Cut-Off Date. However, such  Material Adverse Change shall be
deemed not to have occurred  in case of the following:   (i) the relevant
Facility has returned to scheduled  operation;   (ii) substantially the
whole of (A) the cost of the assets  relating to the Facilities and (B) the
loss of earnings  resulting from the business disruption resulting from 
such Material Adverse Change (together the Losses) are  covered by insurance
of which any one or more Group  Companies have the benefit (the Insurance
Cover). In  determining whether the Insurance Cover covers such  Losses, the
parties hereby agree to the following:   (A) Phoenix shall deliver to the
Purchaser as soon as  practicable after the occurrence of a Material 
Adverse Change and in any event not later than ten  (10) days after such
event, copies of all  policies, claims and other related insurance 
documentation relating to Insurance Cover and the  relevant Facilities (the
Insurance Information).   (B) The Purchaser shall have a period of five (5)
days  after the date of delivery to it of such Insurance  Information, to
review such Insurance Information  and to present to Phoenix in writing
any   15    objections that Insurance Cover will not cover the  Insured
Losses.   (C) If no such written objections as are referred to  in Clause
(B) above are properly presented to  Phoenix by the end of the period stated
above,  then the Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed  that Insurance
Cover documented in the Insurance  Information will cover the Losses and that
there  is no Material Adverse Change.   (D) If any such written objections
as are referred to  above are properly presented to Phoenix by the end  of
the proposed period the specific matters in  dispute shall be referred for
determination to  Marsh Claims Consultancy Services, part of Marsh  UK Ltd
(the Insurance Loss Adjustor) not later  than ten (10) days after the end of
such period.  If such Insurance Loss Adjustor shall for any  reason be
unable or unwilling to act then another  independent firm shall be appointed
to act in its  place by the agreement of Phoenix and the  Purchaser and, in
default of such agreement, at  the request of Phoenix and the Purchaser by
the  President of the Corporation of Professional Loss  Assessors for the
time being. The Insurance Loss  Adjustor shall be instructed to notify the 
Purchaser and Phoenix of its determination  regarding the Insurance Cover and
the Losses  within fifteen (15) days of such referral.   (E) In making its
determination, the Insurance Loss  Adjustor shall act as expert and not as
arbitrator  and the determination by the Insurance Loss  Adjustor shall, in
the absence of manifest error,  be final and binding on the parties and shall
be  deemed to have been accepted and approved by the  parties. The fees and
the costs of the Insurance  Loss Adjustor shall be shared as to fifty per 
cent. (50%) by Phoenix and as to fifty per cent.  (50%) by the
Purchaser.  3.2 Without prejudice to Clause 3.3, the conditions set out in
Clause 3.1(a) and (b) may only be waived jointly in writing by the Purchaser
and Phoenix (on behalf of the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation). The
condition set out in Clause 3.1(c) may be waived only with respect to the
Purchaser\'s and VEG\'s obligations by Phoenix (on behalf of the BCcH
Shareholders and the Foundation), and with respect to the BCcH Shareholders\'
and the Foundation\'s obligations by the Purchaser (on behalf of the
Purchaser and VEG) at any time by notice in writing to the other parties to
this Agreement. The conditions in Clauses 3.1(d), (e) and (f) may only be
waived in writing by the Purchaser.  3.3 Both the Purchaser and VEG, on the
one hand, and the BCcH Shareholders on the other hand, shall use their
reasonable endeavours to procure the fulfilment of the conditions set out in
Clauses 3.1(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), apart from those conditions the
fulfilment of which is entirely outside its respective control, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement.   16   3.4 In order to
ensure that the conditions set out in Clause 3.1(a) are fulfilled, the BCcH
Shareholders shall at all times cooperate with the Purchaser in providing to
the Competition Authority or other persons concerned such information as may
reasonably be necessary to ensure that any request for information from the
relevant Competition Authority or other persons is fulfilled promptly and in
any event in accordance with any relevant time limit, and that, where
practicable, it shall provide copies of any proposed communication with the
Competition Authority or other persons in relation to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the Purchaser and take due consideration of
any comments that the Purchaser may have in relation to such proposed
communication, prior to making the proposed communication, provided that the
BCcH Shareholders shall not be required to provide the Purchaser with any
confidential information or business secrets relating to the Group.  3.5 The
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable endeavours to procure the
fulfilment of the conditions set out in Clause 3.1(a) as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. In particular, the Purchaser
shall take all steps necessary or desirable (including making filings and
notifications), as soon as reasonably practicable, to procure the fulfilment
of the condition set out in Clause 3.1(a). In particular, the Purchaser and
VEG shall, where practicable, promptly notify Phoenix, sufficiently in
advance (for the purposes referred to below in this sub-clause 3.5) of any
notification, submission, response or other communication (in each case
whether in writing or otherwise) (excluding communications of an
administrative nature) which they propose to make or submit to any
Competition Authority or other persons and at the same time provide Phoenix
with copies thereof and any supporting documentation or information
reasonably requested by Phoenix, provided that the Purchaser shall not be
required to provide Phoenix with any confidential information or
business secrets. The Purchaser undertakes to take due consideration of any
comments which Phoenix may have in relation to any such notification,
submission, communication or response to a request for further information
prior to making the relevant notification, submission, communication or
response (as the case may be). The Purchaser further agrees to keep Phoenix
fully informed as to the progress of any notification made to any of the
Competition Authorities or other persons referred to in Clause 3.1(a) and,
where reasonably requested by Phoenix, the Purchaser shall permit Phoenix or
its advisers to attend all meetings with the Competition Authority or other
persons concerned (unless prohibited by the other person or authority
concerned) and, where appropriate, to make oral submissions at such
meetings.  3.6 The Purchaser undertakes to each of the BCcH Shareholders and
the Foundation that it will not (and that it will procure that no member of
the Purchaser\'s Group will) make any filings with any Competition Authority
or other persons other than those filings to which Phoenix, on behalf of the
BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation, agrees in writing or failing such
agreement which the Purchaser has been advised in writing by Hasche Sigle is
necessary to make in order to procure the fulfilment of the conditions set
out in Clause 3.1. Before making such filing, the Purchaser agrees to notify
Phoenix in writing of its intention to do so and to give Phoenix, on behalf
of the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation, a reasonable opportunity to
challenge such opinion.  3.7 Without prejudice to the generality of the
Purchaser\'s obligations under the other provisions of this Clause 3, the
Purchaser shall (or shall procure that the relevant member(s) of the
Purchaser\'s Group shall), where required to do so in order to  
17   procure the satisfaction of any of the conditions listed in Clause
3.1(a) comply with, and agrees to provide suitable undertakings to meet, all
requirements of any Competition Authority or other persons from which any
consent, approval or action is required or desirable in order to complete the
sale and purchase of the Sale Shares and the Foundation Shares and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation
agreeing to hold separate or dispose of any part of the business of the
Group, provided that this sub-clause 3.7 shall not require the Purchaser to
take any action or give any undertaking in order to procure the satisfaction
of the condition listed in Clause 3.1(a) which the Purchaser, in its
reasonable discretion, determines would not be commercially reasonable for it
to be required to take or give.  3.8 Without prejudice to the generality of
the BCcH Shareholders\' obligations under the other provisions of this Clause
3, the BCcH Shareholders shall:  (a) co-operate in good faith in order to
achieve compliance with the  requirements of any Competition Authority or
other persons;  (b) not object to any undertakings given by the Purchaser
with respect to the  Company in connection with obtaining consent, approval
or action of any  relevant Competition Authority or other persons; and  (c)
co-operate with and assist the Purchaser in any notification or filing 
procedure(s) by providing in good faith any necessary information and 
documents.  3.9 If any of the conditions set out in Clause 3.1 has not been
fulfilled or waived pursuant to Clause 3.2 by 5:00pm (London time) on the
Termination Date, then:  (a) none of the BCcH Shareholders, the Foundation,
the Purchaser or VEG shall  be bound to proceed with Completion; and  (b)
this Agreement shall automatically terminate.  and in all other respects, no
party shall have any Claim hereunder of any nature whatsoever against the
other party save in respect of their accrued rights and/or liabilities
arising from any prior breach of this Agreement.  3.10 If any fact which
makes any of the conditions set out Clause 3.1 incapable of being satisfied
in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 3 (taking account of the
Purchaser\'s, VEG\'s and the BCcH Shareholders\' obligations under Clause
3.3) comes to the knowledge of the Purchaser or of Phoenix at any time prior
to Completion then each such party shall notify the other of that fact
and (unless the party is responsible for making such condition incapable of
being satisfied) each party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by
written notice to the other party (in the case of Phoenix, such termination
being effected for itself and on behalf of the other BCcH Shareholders and
the Foundation) and the provisions set forth in Clause 3.9 shall apply to
such termination.  3.11 The Purchaser and VEG acknowledges that the BCcH
Shareholders and the Foundation may be irreparably injured by a breach by the
Purchaser or VEG of their obligations under the terms of Clause 3 and that
the BCcH Shareholders and the   18   Foundation shall be entitled to
claim equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance,
in the event of any threatened or actual breach of such terms. Such remedies
shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of such terms
by the Purchaser or VEG, but shall be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or equity.  4. PRE-COMPLETION UNDERTAKINGS  4.1 Save with
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, such consent (save with respect
to paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (k) and (j) of Part A of Schedule 4, in respect
of which the Purchaser may withhold its consent in its absolute discretion)
not to be unreasonably withheld and which consent shall be deemed to be given

of Schedule 4, Phoenix shall procure (so far as it is within its power to do
so) that between the date of this Agreement and Completion, each Group
Company shall take such actions or refrain from taking such actions as are

permitted or required to take them under the terms of this Agreement.  4.2
For the purposes of Clause 4.1, the Purchaser shall at the date of
this Agreement nominate an individual who shall be responsible for giving or
refusing consent if requested by Phoenix. Consent received from such person
shall be sufficient consent for the purposes of Clause 4.1.  4.3 Neither
the Purchaser nor VEG shall liquidate, dissolve, wind up its affairs or merge
with any corporation or sell or convey all or substantially all of its
assets, nor shall the Purchaser enter into any similar transaction in which
the Purchaser is not a continuing public company with reporting obligations
under the Exchange Act.  4.4 The Purchaser shall procure that, prior to
Completion, US Newco is incorporated as a direct subsidiary of the Purchaser
and that US Newco shall not carry on any business or have any assets or
liabilities of any nature whatsoever before Completion, except for those

of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall take all such steps and deliver all such

acknowledges that from the date of entry into the Confidentiality Letter
until Completion, it has not and shall not (and shall procure that its group

Company or any officer or  employee of any Group Company; or  (b) use
Information provided by Phoenix, the Company or any Connected Person  (as
such terms are defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), persuade or 
seek   19    to persuade any customer, supplier or independent contractor
of any of the  Group Companies to cease to do business or reduce the amount
of business  which such customer, supplier or independent contractor has
customarily  done with such Group Company.  4.7 To the extent that it has
not supplied copies by the date of this Agreement, Phoenix shall forthwith
provide the Purchaser with a copy of the Shareholders Agreement, the Senior
Credit Agreement, the Intercreditor Deed dated January 14 1999, the agreement

and copies of all agreements relating to the obligation of the Company or any
Group Company to pay or reimburse the Compass Management Fee and the
Transaction Fees. Phoenix shall also, without undue delay after the date of
this Agreement, deliver to the Purchaser, copies of the documentation
relating to all outstanding pledges, charges, liens and encumbrances granted
pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement or the Mezzanine Credit Agreement, as
well as copies of each of the Letter of Credit Guarantees. Phoenix will, in
addition, provide copies of any agreements entered into by any Group Company
on or after today\'s date relating to the Shareholders Agreement, the Senior
Credit Agreement, the Co-Investor Loan, the Mezzanine Credit Agreement or the
payment of the Compass Management Fee or any of the Transaction Fees, as soon
as practicable after execution thereof by the relevant Group Company.  4.8

with copies of:  (a) its monthly reports to the lenders under the Senior
Credit Agreement as  soon as practicable after delivery of such reports as
required pursuant to  the Senior Credit Agreement;  (b) from October 1,
2002, copies of all requests made for consents or  approvals as required

soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, reasonable  details of
the actions that have been taken by any Group Company during  the period from
and including 30 September 2002 to but excluding the date  of this Agreement

during that period, would have required the Purchaser\'s  consent; and  (d)
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, reasonable  details
of any items of Capital Expenditure of more than 500,000 euros  paid by any
Group Company during the period from and including 30  September 2002 to but

the Purchaser, with reasonable notice to Phoenix (such notice to specify the
reason for the visit) and with the prior written consent of Phoenix (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and subject always to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall be allowed such access as it
may reasonably require to the premises (provided that the Purchaser shall  
20   comply with any reasonable restrictions required by Phoenix while
visiting such premises) and to Senior Management, provided that no notice to
or consent from Phoenix will be required in order for the Purchaser to
communicate with the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and
the corporate development director of the Company. For the purposes of this
Clause 4.9, Phoenix nominates Ken Hanna as the individual who shall be
responsible for giving or refusing consent if requested under the terms of
this Clause 4.9. Consent received from Mr Hanna shall be sufficient consent
for the purposes of this Clause 4.9.  4.10 If Phoenix acquires actual
knowledge at any time between the Cut-Off Date and Completion that any Group
Company has taken any action or refrained from taking any action, in each
case at any time during the period between the Cut-Off Date and Completion,
which, had the provisions of Clause 4.1 and Schedule 4 comprised obligations
of each Group Company during that period, would have constituted a breach by
that Group Company of those provisions resulting in a loss of US$20 million
or more for the Group, it shall notify the Purchaser forthwith;  4.11 If
Phoenix acquires actual knowledge at any time prior to Completion
that proceedings of the kind referred to in Clause 3.1(e) or any one of the

notify the Purchaser forthwith and, subject to such consents as are required
under the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement and the Mezzanine Credit
Agreement first having been obtained in writing, shall use its reasonable
endeavours to procure that the Company enters into such loan agreements with
the Purchaser (or other persons as arranged by the Purchaser) as the
Purchaser may reasonably require with a view to providing the Company with

entitled to terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Phoenix, unless
Phoenix delivers to the Purchaser, within two Business Days of deliveries

reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser that the amounts payable under the
Clauses 6.12(c) will be reduced by an amount at least equal to the amount by

conversion of the 5.75%  convertible notes due 2006 of the Purchaser\'s
General Semiconductor, Inc.  subsidiary and (vii) 9,133,447 shares of Common

above or as contemplated by this  Agreement, there is no existing option,
warrant, call, right, commitment  or other agreement of any character to
which the Purchaser is a party  requiring, nor are there securities of the
Purchaser outstanding which  upon conversion or exchange would require, the
issuance, sale or transfer  of any additional shares of capital stock or
other equity securities of  the Purchaser, or other securities convertible
into, exchangeable for or  evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase
shares of capital stock  or other equity securities of the Purchaser. Except
as disclosed in the  Purchaser\'s Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed  
35    with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on April
22,  2002, or as contemplated in the Agreement, Purchaser is not a party to
any  voting trust or other voting agreement with respect to or agreement 
relating to the transfer or disposition of any of the capital stock of the 
Purchaser.  (g) The Purchaser has the corporate power and authority to sell,
transfer,  assign and deliver (or provide for the sale, transfer, assignment
or  delivery of) the Consideration Warrants and to issue the Notes and
enter  into the Put and Call Agreement.  10.2 Each of the Purchaser
Warranties shall be construed as a separate Purchaser Warranty and (save as
expressly provided to the contrary) shall not be limited or restricted by
reference to or inference from the terms of any other Purchaser Warranty or
any other terms of this Agreement.  10.3 Each of the Purchaser Warranties
shall be deemed to include a further warranty, that it shall remain true and
accurate at all times up to and including Completion.  10.4 The Purchaser
and VEG acknowledge that each of the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation
have entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the
Purchaser Warranties.  11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the side letter entered into on the same date
as this Agreement relating to the satisfaction or otherwise of the conditions
set out in Clause 3.1 together set out the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties in respect of its subject matter. It is
agreed that:  (a) no party has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon
any  representation, warranty or undertaking of any other party or any of
its  Related Persons which is not expressly set out or referred to in this 
Agreement;  (b) a party may claim in contract for breach of warranty under
this Agreement  but shall have no claim or remedy in respect of
misrepresentation (whether  negligent or otherwise, and whether made prior
to, and/or in, this  Agreement) or untrue statement made by any other party
or any of its  Related Persons;  (c) this Clause shall not exclude any
liability for, or remedy in respect of,  fraudulent misrepresentation by a
party or any of its Related Persons; and  (d) save as expressly set out in
this Agreement, no party or Related Person  shall owe any duty of care to any
other party or Related Person.  Each party contracts in this Clause on its
own behalf and as agent for each of its Related Persons. Each Related Person
which contracts through the agency of a party may enforce this Clause direct
against each other party and Related Person. Related Person means (a) a
party\'s officers, employees, group undertakings, agents and advisers, (b)
officers, employees, agents and advisers of a party\'s group undertakings;
and (c) officers, employees and partners of any such agent or adviser or of
any group undertaking of such an agent or adviser. For the avoidance of
doubt, for the purpose   36   of this Clause 11 each Group Company shall
be treated as a group undertaking of Phoenix.  For the avoidance of doubt,
this Clause 11 applies in respect of the estimate delivered by Phoenix
pursuant to Clause 5.1(b).  12. NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS  Save as set forth
in Clause 11, a person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no
right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any
of its terms (including without limitation those of Clause 7.1).  13.
VARIATION  13.1 Subject to Clause 13.2, no variation of this Agreement (or
of any of the documents referred to herein) shall be valid unless it is in
writing and signed by or on behalf of each of the parties hereto. The parties
acknowledge that in respect of variations of a non-material nature, Phoenix
may sign such written variation on behalf of all the BCcH Shareholders, the
Foundation and the Mezzanine Lenders. The expression "variation" shall
include any variation, supplement, deletion or replacement however
effected.  13.2 Unless expressly agreed, no variation shall constitute a
general waiver of any provisions of this Agreement, nor shall it affect any
rights, obligations or liabilities under or pursuant to this Agreement which
have already accrued up to the date of variation, and the rights and
obligations of the parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect, except and only to the extent that they are so
varied.  14. ASSIGNMENT  No party shall be entitled to assign the benefit
of any provision of this Agreement without the prior written consent of all
the other parties save that the Purchaser may assign the rights under this
Agreement to the Purchaser or any subsidiary of the Purchaser. Any assignment
in contravention of this Clause shall be void. If the benefit of the whole or
any part of this Agreement is assigned by the Purchaser to any subsidiary of
the Purchaser in accordance with this Clause 14 then, where any such assignee
subsequently ceases to be a subsidiary of the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
procure that before it so ceases it shall assign that benefit to the
Purchaser or to another subsidiary of the Purchaser.  15.
SUCCESSORS  This Agreement shall be binding on and inure for the benefit of
the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.  16. AGREEMENT TO
REMAIN IN FORCE  So far as it remains to be performed, this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding Completion.   37   17.
NO RIGHT TO RESCIND  Without prejudice to any rights of termination
contained in this Agreement, the sole remedy against any of the BCcH
Shareholders, the Foundation and/or Mezzanine Lenders for any breach of this
Agreement shall be an action for damages and the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to rescind this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude
any remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation by any BCcH Shareholder, the
Foundation or Mezzanine Lender save that, in the case of fraudulent
misrepresentation by any of the foregoing, the Purchaser will not be entitled
to rescind this Agreement with respect to any other BCcH Shareholder, the
Foundation or Mezzanine Lender.  18. INTEREST  If payment of any sum due
under the terms of this Agreement shall be delayed, the payer shall pay
interest on such sum, from the date on which such sum is due until the date
of payment, at a rate equal to two and a half cent. (2.5%) above LIBOR such
interest to accrue on a daily basis with six monthly rests.  19.
ANNOUNCEMENTS  19.1 Subject to Clause 19.2, prior to Completion, except as
otherwise agreed to by the parties, the parties shall not issue any report,
statement or press release or otherwise make any public statements with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except as
in the reasonable judgment of the party may be required by law or the rules
of any stock exchange, in which case the parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach mutual agreement as to the language of any such
report, statement or press release. Upon the signing of this Agreement and on
Completion, the parties will consult with each other with respect to the
issuance of a joint report, statement or press release with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  19.2 Each of the BCcH
Shareholders and the Foundation may make confidential communications to their
respective general and limited partners or other investors or prospective
investors.  20. COSTS  20.1 Subject to Clauses 6.8, 8.2, 8.4 and 20.2, and
any other Clause of this Agreement entitling one party to recover Costs from
another party if particular conditions are not fulfilled, each of the parties
shall pay its own Costs incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation and implementation of this Agreement.  20.2 The Purchaser shall
bear all stamp or other documentary or transaction duties and any other
transfer taxes arising as a result or in consequence of any of the transfers
which take place at Completion or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or of
its implementation.  21. INVALIDITY  If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall (so far as it
is invalid or unenforceable) be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be
included in this Agreement but without invalidating any of the  
38   remaining provisions of this Agreement, provided that no party\'s
rights under the Agreement, taken as a whole, are materially adversely
effected thereby. The parties shall then use all reasonable endeavours to
replace the invalid or unenforceable provisions by a valid and enforceable
provision the effect of which is as close as possible to the intended effect
of the invalid or unenforceable provision.  22. COUNTERPARTS  This
Agreement may be entered into in any number of counterparts and by
the parties to it on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed
and delivered, shall be an original, but all the counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.  23. PURCHASER
GUARANTEE  23.1 In consideration of the BCcH Shareholders, the Foundation
and the Mezzanine Lenders entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as a continuing obligation the
proper and punctual performance by VEG of all its obligations under or
pursuant to this Agreement and any other documents of transfer or otherwise
or obligations entered or to be entered into according to the terms of this
Agreement.  23.2 The Purchaser\'s liability under this Agreement shall not
be discharged or impaired by:  (a) any amendment to or variation of this
Agreement, or any waiver of or  departure from its terms, or any assignment
of it or any part of it, or  any document entered into under this
Agreement;  (b) any release of, or granting of time or other indulgence to
any of the BCcH  Shareholders, the Foundation and the Mezzanine Lenders or
any third party,  or the existence or validity of any other security taken by
any of the  BCcH Shareholders, the Foundation and the Mezzanine Lenders in
relation to  this Agreement or any enforcement of or failure to enforce or
the release  of any such security; or  (c) any winding up, dissolution,
reconstruction, arrangement or  reorganisation, legal limitation, incapacity
or lack of corporate power or  authority or other circumstances of, or any
change in the constitution or  corporate identity or loss of corporate
identity by, any of the BCcH  Shareholders or the Foundation (or any act
taken by any of the BCcH  Shareholders, the Foundation or the Mezzanine
Lenders in relation to any  such event).  24. AUTHORITY  24.1 Each of the
BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation hereby appoint Phoenix as their agent
for:  (a) the receipt of any Consideration Warrants or any other
consideration or  amounts deliverable or payable to them under this Agreement
by the  Purchaser and payment or issue to Phoenix of such consideration or
money  will be sufficient discharge of the corresponding obligation and the 
Purchaser shall not be obliged to consider the existence or suitability of 
any agreement   39    among the Mezzanine Lenders, the BCcH Shareholders
and the Foundation, or  any of them;  (b) the delivery to the Purchaser of
directions as to the proportion each BCcH  Shareholder or the Foundation is
to receive of Consideration Warrants and  Notes and the Purchaser shall be
entitled to rely on any such direction  without any enquiry of the BCcH
Shareholder.  25. WAIVER  25.1 Any delay by any party in exercising, or
failure to exercise, any right or remedy under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or a waiver of any other rights or
remedies or preclude its exercise at any subsequent time and no single or
partial exercise of any rights or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise
shall prevent any further exercise of the right or remedy or the exercise of
any other right or remedy.  25.2 The rights and remedies of any party under
this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised as often as such party
considers it appropriate and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.  26. FURTHER ASSURANCE  26.1 Each of the BCcH
Shareholders, the Foundation and the Mezzanine Lenders shall do or procure to
be done all such further acts and things, and execute and deliver (or procure

47      Schedule 3   preparation of Adjusted Financial Debt
Statement   Part A  1. INTERPRETATION  1.1 In this Schedule 3, the
following expressions shall have the following meanings:  Accounts means
the audited consolidated accounts of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, for the accounting period ended
December 31 2001, comprising a balance sheet, profit and loss account, notes
and auditors\' report;   Adjusted Financial Debt Statement has the meaning
given in Part B of this Schedule 3;   Independent Firm means KPMG of The
Netherlands or such other Dutch independent firm as is appointed pursuant to
Part B of this Schedule;   Phoenix\'s Accountants means either or both of
PwC and Deloitte and Touche, as directed by Phoenix;   Purchaser\'s
Accountants means Ernst and Young;   Review Period has the meaning given Part
B in this Schedule 3; and   Spot Rate means the spot rate of exchange
(closing mid point) on the relevant date, as quoted in the London edition of
the Financial Times first published thereafter or, where no such rate of
exchange is published in respect of that date, at the rate quoted by Citibank
N.A. as at the close of business in London on that date.  1.2 For the
purposes of calculating the Adjusted Financial Debt, any amounts which are to
be included in the calculation and which are expressed in a currency other
than euros shall be converted into euros using the Spot Rate on the close of
business on the Completion Date.   Part B  2. PREPARATION AND FINALISATION
OF THE ADJUSTED FINANCIAL DEBT  2.1 Phoenix (on behalf of the BCcH
Shareholders and the Foundation) shall deliver to the Purchaser as soon as
practicable after the Cut-Off Date and in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Cut-Off Date, a draft Adjusted Financial Debt
Statement in relation to the Company in the form set out in Exhibit 3 (the
Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement).  2.2 The Purchaser shall have
until the date which is thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the
Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement (the Review Period), in conjunction
with the Purchaser\'s Accountants, to review the Draft Adjusted Financial  
48   Debt Statement and to present to Phoenix in writing any objections
(stating in reasonable detail, including specific amounts, the matters in
dispute) it may have to the Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement and the
Adjusted Financial Debt set forth therein. The only grounds upon which the
Purchaser shall be entitled to object to any Adjusted Financial Debt
Statement or Adjusted Financial Debt are arithmetical errors in the
computation of such amounts or that it has not been prepared in accordance
with the provisions of Part C of this Schedule. Any such objections must be
accompanied by a recalculation of each amount in the Draft Adjusted Financial
Debt Statement to which such objections relate.  2.3 For the purposes of
enabling Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants to prepare the Draft Adjusted
Financial Debt Statement, the Purchaser shall and shall procure that the
Group shall, following Completion, give Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants
reasonable access at all reasonable times (until the Adjusted Financial Debt
Statement has been agreed or finally determined) to all employees, books and
records, and all computer files relating to the business of the Company and
the Group and generally shall provide Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants with
such other information and assistance as Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants
may reasonably request, provided that Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants
shall not be entitled to any such access and information which goes beyond
that which is reasonably necessary to determine whether the Draft Adjusted
Financial Debt Statement has been prepared in accordance with the provisions
of Part C of this Schedule. If the Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement is
delivered before Completion, for the purposes of enabling the Purchaser and
the Purchaser\'s Accountants to commence the review contemplated by paragraph
2.2 above, Phoenix shall and shall procure that the Group shall, before
Completion, give the Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Accountants
reasonable access at all reasonable times to all employees, books and
records, and all computer files relating to the business of the Company and
the Group and generally shall provide the Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s
Accountants with such other information and assistance as the Purchaser and
the Purchaser\'s Accountants may reasonably request, provided that the
Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Accountants shall not be entitled to any such
access and information which goes beyond that which is reasonably necessary
to determine whether the Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement has been
prepared in accordance with the provisions of Part C of this Schedule.  2.4
If no such written objections as are referred to in paragraph 2.2
are properly presented to Phoenix by the end of the Review Period, then the
Draft Adjusted Financial Debt Statement and the Adjusted Financial Debt set
forth therein shall, as between the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation and
the Purchaser, be deemed to have been accepted and approved by the BCcH
Shareholders and the Foundation and the Purchaser and the Draft Adjusted
Financial Debt Statement shall be final and binding on all of the parties to
this Agreement and shall constitute the Adjusted Financial Debt Statement for
the purposes of this Agreement.  2.5 If any such written objections as are
referred to in paragraph 2.2 are properly presented to Phoenix by the end of
the Review Period then Phoenix (on behalf of the BCcH Shareholders and the
Foundation) and the Purchaser shall attempt to resolve the objections in good
faith negotiations. To facilitate Phoenix\'s review of any such objections,
the Purchaser shall provide Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants with such
information and explanations as Phoenix and Phoenix\'s Accountants may
reasonably require for the purpose of the review. If Phoenix and the
Purchaser resolve all matters in dispute in relation to the Draft Adjusted
Financial Debt Statement, then such Draft   49   Adjusted Financial Debt
Statement (as adjusted to reflect the matters so resolved) shall, as between
the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation and the Purchaser, be deemed to have
been accepted and approved by the BCcH Shareholders and the Foundation and

THE FOUNDATION  1. CONDITION TO THE FOUNDATION\'S OBLIGATIONS BECOMING
EFFECTIVE UNDER THE AGREEMENT  Save for paragraph 2.1 below, the provisions
of this Agreement shall take effect with respect to the Foundation but only
in relation to those Foundation Shares represented by Depositary Receipts
that have been transferred to and cancelled by the Foundation and only at the
point when they have been so transferred and cancelled, and subject also to
the satisfaction of all conditions required to be satisfied under the
Foundation Rules and applicable law in order for the provisions of this
Agreement so to take effect.  2. FOUNDATION UNDERTAKINGS  2.1 Procedure in
relation to Depositary Receipts. Unless all of the holders of Depositary
Receipts provide irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of a named officer
of the Foundation (or such other person as the Foundation shall nominate) to
execute private deeds pursuant to which their Depositary Receipts will be
transferred to the Foundation (in which event any and all other actions on
the part of the Foundation as described below in this paragraph 2.1 shall
not be required), the Foundation hereby agrees to take such steps as it is
entitled to take under the terms of the Foundation Rules (including without
limitation:  (a) convening a meeting of the holders of the Depositary
Receipts, for the  purpose of approving the transfer of the Depositary
Receipts by the  respective holders to the Foundation and the transfer by the
Foundation of  the Foundation Shares to the Purchaser;  (b) the submission
to the holders of the Depositary Receipts of relevant forms  of proxy;
and  (c) initiating such Court proceedings in The Netherlands as the Board
of the  Foundation reasonably considers necessary),  to procure that the
Depositary Receipts are all transferred to the Foundation, in each case
through the execution of a private deed. The Foundation acknowledges and
agrees that, to enable the Foundation to transfer the Foundation Shares to
the Purchaser at or after Completion:   (i) each such private deed shall
stipulate that any rights attached to  any Depositary Receipt are cancelled
as a result of any such  transfer and that, as a result of the transfers of
all the  Depositary Receipts to the Foundation, the Foundation will hold
the  Foundation Shares and there will be no outstanding Depositary 
Receipts;   (ii) each such private deed will also stipulate that the
Foundation Share  Consideration will be allotted, issued or otherwise
transferred by  the Purchaser to, and held in the name of, Phoenix, which
will then  hold   57    that Foundation Shares Consideration on the
basis provided for in  paragraph 2.3 below on behalf of all the persons that
have  transferred Depositary Receipts to the Foundation; and  (iii) the
Foundation will transfer the Foundation Shares directly to the  Purchaser,
instead of transferring them to the holders of the A  Shares in the capital
of the Company for onward transfer to the  Purchaser;  The Foundation
further undertakes that in accordance with paragraph 2.2 below
it will:  (d) transfer at Completion to the Purchaser Foundation Shares pro
rata to the  Depository Receipts that have then been transferred to and
cancelled by  the Foundation, with the number of Foundation Shares so
transferred being  rounded down to the nearest whole share; and  (e)
thereafter upon the transfer to and cancellation by the Foundation of all 
the remaining Depository Receipts, transfer the remaining Foundation  Shares
to the Purchaser.  2.2 Delivery and Escrow Arrangements for Foundation Share
Consideration. If:  (a) the Foundation has the authority to transfer all
the Foundation Shares to  the Purchaser at Completion, then the Foundation
Share Consideration shall  be delivered by the Purchaser to Phoenix in
accordance with Clause 6 of  this Agreement, at the same time as the Sale
Shares are transferred to the  Purchaser, and be held by Phoenix on the basis
provided for in paragraph  2.3 below; whereas  (b) if the Foundation has
the authority to transfer only part of the  Foundation Shares to the
Purchaser at Completion:   (i) the Foundation Share Consideration shall be
delivered pro rata to  the Foundation Shares transferred to the Purchaser in
accordance  with Clause 6 of this Agreement, at the same time as the Sale
Shares  are transferred to the Purchaser and shall be held by Phoenix on
the  basis provided for in paragraph 2.3 below; and   (ii) the Purchaser
shall deposit the remaining Foundation Share  Consideration in an escrow
account set up jointly by Phoenix and the  Purchaser and such Foundation
Share Consideration shall not be  released until the completion of the
transfer of the outstanding  Foundation Shares has taken place, at which
point Phoenix and the  Purchaser shall issue a joint instruction for such
Foundation Share  Consideration to be released from that escrow account and
delivered  to Phoenix, from which point onwards Phoenix shall hold the 
Foundation Share Consideration on the basis provided for in  paragraph 2.3
below; and  (c) if the Foundation does not have authority to transfer any of
the  Foundation Shares to the Purchaser at Completion, then the Purchaser
shall  deposit the   58    Foundation Share Consideration in an escrow
account set up jointly by  Phoenix and the Purchaser and such Foundation
Share Consideration shall  not be released until the completion of the
transfer of the Foundation  Shares to the Purchaser has taken place, at which
point Phoenix and the  Purchaser shall issue a joint instruction for such
Foundation Share  Consideration to be released from that escrow account and
delivered to  Phoenix, from which point onwards Phoenix shall hold the
Foundation Share  Consideration on the basis provided for in the paragraph
2.3 below.  2.3 Powers of Phoenix. The Foundation hereby gives irrevocable
authority to Phoenix, as its attorney:  (a) to receive and to hold the
Foundation Share Consideration in the name of  Phoenix;  (b) to negotiate
and agree on behalf of the Foundation the terms on which the  Foundation
Share Consideration is to be allocated as between the  Foundation (for itself
and on behalf of the holders of the Depositary  Receipts) on the one hand and
any one or more other parties to this  Agreement on the other hand;  (c) to
determine in its sole and absolute discretion whether and when to  realise
the Foundation Share Consideration, and the terms of such  realisation,
subject to accounting to the persons other than the Mezzanine  Lenders that
have transferred Depositary Receipts to the Foundation in  accordance with
this Schedule 5, either directly or through the  Foundation, for the net cash
proceeds of such realisation (such cash to be  distributed to and amongst
those persons on a pro rata basis based upon  the percentage and
classification of the Depositary Receipts respectively  so transferred by
those persons);  (d) to execute on behalf of the Foundation any and all
deeds, documents or  agreements and to take any and all such other actions
and to do any and  all such things on behalf of the Foundation as may be
necessary, desirable  or conducive to give effect to the foregoing and to
exercise in its  absolute discretion any rights pursuant to any such deed,
document or  agreement,  and everything with the power of substitution and
with indemnity for Phoenix for all activities it performs pursuant to the
above power of attorney.  The Foundation also acknowledges and agrees that
Phoenix and any Transferee (as defined below) shall be entitled to transfer
some or all of the Foundation Share Consideration to Phoenix Bermuda L.P. or
any group undertaking of, or entity established by, Phoenix, Phoenix Bermuda
L.P. or any of the Other Investors other than European Private Equity
Investors L.L.C. (any such transferee being a Transferee). The Foundation
undertakes to Phoenix that, if such a transfer takes place, then the
Foundation shall grant an irrevocable power of attorney to the Transferee
concerned in the same terms as this paragraph 2.3 on receipt of notice in
writing from Phoenix requiring such grant to be made.  2.4 Delivery of an
Opinion on the Delivery of the Foundation Shares. At the Completion of the
transfer by the Foundation of the Foundation Shares to the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall receive an opinion as to the Foundation in the agreed
form.   59   3. PURCHASER UNDERTAKINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE
FOUNDATION  3.1 The Purchaser hereby agrees that the Foundation
Consideration in respect of the Foundation Shares shall be allotted, issued
or otherwise transferred by the Purchaser to, and held in the name of,
Phoenix on the basis provided for in paragraph 2.3 above.  3.2 The
Purchaser hereby agrees that, if for any reason any of the
Depositary Receipts are transferred to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
immediately transfer all such Depositary Receipts to the Foundation for
cancellation, shall waive all right, title and interest that the Purchaser
may have with respect to such Depositary Receipts and shall execute and
deliver all documents to the Foundation necessary to effect such waiver,
including, without limitation, a private deed.  4. OTHER PARTIES\'
UNDERTAKINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE FOUNDATION  4.1 Each party to this
Agreement which holds Depositary Receipts at the date of this Agreement
hereby agrees with respect to the Depositary Receipts it holds:  (a) to
provide before or at Completion an irrevocable power of attorney in  favour
of a named officer of the Foundation (or such other person as the  Foundation
shall nominate) to execute private deeds pursuant to which its  Depository
Receipts will be transferred to the Foundation; and, if  applicable  (b) to
vote affirmatively for (upon the convening of a meeting of the holders  of
the Depositary Receipts to consider such proposal), or to provide an 
appropriate proxy in favour of, the transfer of the Depositary Receipts to 
the Foundation on the basis described in paragraph 2 and (ii) to transfer  to
the Foundation all such Depositary Receipts for cancellation, waive all 
right, title and interest that such Party Shareholder may have with  respect

payment is made to it by or on behalf of the Foundation which is attributable
or relates to the Foundation Share Consideration and/or that Mezzanine
Lender\'s holding of Depositary Receipts, it will promptly account to Phoenix
for the whole of the sum so received in order for Phoenix to distribute it,
