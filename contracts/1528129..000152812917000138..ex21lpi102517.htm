Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, (a)
each Seller will sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and (b)
Buyer will purchase and accept from each such Seller, all of the Membership
Interests owned by such Seller, free and clear of all Liens (other than
transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws or under the
Organizational Documents of the Company) and together with all accrued rights
and benefits attached thereto, including those Membership Interests listed
opposite such Seller's name on Schedule 2.1.

Section 2.2 Purchase Price. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as full consideration for the sale, assignment, transfer and

"Purchase Price") to be paid by Buyer to the Sellers is $1,825,000,000,
subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(a) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be paid in the following manner:

(i) the Indebtedness Amount included in the calculation of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount shall be paid by Buyer on behalf of the Acquired Companies
to all holders of such Indebtedness Amount, by wire transfer of immediately

wire transfer of immediately available funds, in such amounts owing to each
such Person and to the account(s) designated in writing by each such Person;
and

(iii) an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (i) the Purchase Price, plus
(ii) the Estimated Adjustment Amount (such resulting sum, the "Closing
Amount") shall be paid by Buyer to the Sellers, in accordance with their Pro
Rata Percentages, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the wire transfer instructions set forth on Schedule 2.3(f).

(b) Sellers shall have a contingent right to receive an additional payment as
set forth on Schedule 2.2(b) (the "Additional Payment").

Section 2.3 Estimated Adjustment Amount and Post-Closing Final Adjustment
Amount.

(a) Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will prepare and deliver to Buyer a preliminary settlement statement (the
"Preliminary Settlement Statement"), which shall include a calculation and
good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount prepared in accordance with the
principles set forth on Exhibit A (such estimated amount, the "Estimated
Adjustment Amount"). The Estimated Adjustment Amount will be used for purposes
of calculating the Purchase Price to be delivered at Closing, including the
Closing Amount and shall be subject to further adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.3(b).

(b) Not later than the 60th day following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
the Company to prepare and deliver to the Sellers a statement (the "Post-
Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of the final Adjustment
Amount (the "Final Adjustment Amount"). The Post-Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the principles set forth on Exhibit A. Buyer and
the Company will provide to the Sellers such additional data and information
as the Sellers may reasonably request to verify the amounts reflected on the
Post-Closing Statement. Not later than the 30th day following receipt of the
Post-Closing Statement hereunder, either Seller may deliver to Buyer and the
Company a written notice (an "Adjustment Notice") containing any changes such
Seller proposes to be made in the Post-Closing Statement, together with
reasonable supporting explanation for such changes. If neither Seller delivers
to Buyer and the Company an Adjustment Notice within such 30 day period, then
the Sellers will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted and agreed to all
items in the Post-Closing Statement, and the Final Adjustment Amount set forth
therein will be considered final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If
either Seller or both Sellers timely deliver to Buyer and the Company an
Adjustment Notice, all items in the Post-Closing Statement, other than such
matters that are specifically disputed in such Adjustment Notice or Adjustment
Notices, shall be deemed to be accepted and agreed to by the Sellers. The
Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on the Final Adjustment Amount
no later than 30 days after delivery of any Adjustment Notice in accordance
with the foregoing (such 30 day period, the "Resolution Period").

(c) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to Buyer in accordance with
Section 2.3(b) and the Final Adjustment Amount is mutually agreed upon in
writing by the





18




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

Parties during such Resolution Period, then the Final Adjustment Amount as so
agreed will be considered final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

(d) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to Buyer and the Company in
accordance with Section 2.3(b) and the Final Adjustment Amount is not mutually
agreed upon by the Parties during such Resolution Period, then an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the
"Accountant") will be engaged by the Parties to resolve any remaining
disagreements with respect to the Final Adjustment Amount. If such accounting
firm does not agree to serve as the Accountant within ten days after written
request from the Parties to serve, then the Parties will mutually select and
engage an alternative independent nationally recognized accounting firm, or if
the Parties are unable to agree upon such firm or such firm declines to serve
as the Accountant, then any Party may request that the American Arbitration
Association select the Accountant, and the Parties will engage such
Accountant. In connection with the engagement of the Accountant, each Party
will execute such engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Accountant
and the American Arbitration Association may reasonably require as a condition
to such engagement. Each Party will use reasonable efforts to cause the
Accountant to render its decision as soon as practicable after such
engagement, including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by
the Accountant for information, books, records and similar items. The Parties
will instruct the Accountant to make a determination of whether the Post-
Closing Statement requires adjustment (i) in writing, (ii) as promptly as
practicable after the dispute has been referred to the Accountant (but in no
event later than 30 days thereafter) and (iii) in accordance with this
Agreement. The Parties agree to instruct the Accountant to consider only those
items and amounts with respect to the calculation of the Final Adjustment
Amount which the Parties are unable to resolve following expiration of the
Resolution Period. In resolving any such disputed item, the Accountant may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by a Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by a
Party. The Accountant may not award damages or penalties. The fees and
expenses of the Accountants will be paid by the Party(ies) against whom a
majority of the matters (based on dollar amounts) are determined. No Party
will disclose to the Accountant, and the Accountant will not consider for any
purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any Party. The
Accountant's determination of the disputed items will be final, conclusive and
binding upon each of the Parties. The date on which the Final Adjustment
Amount is finally determined in accordance with Section 2.3(b), Section 2.3(c)
or this Section 2.3(d), as applicable, is referred to as the "Determination
Date."

(e) If the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, then Buyer will pay to the Sellers, in accordance with their Pro Rata
Percentages, the difference in Dollars between the Final Adjustment Amount and
the Estimated Adjustment Amount. If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than
the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the Sellers shall refund to Buyer an
amount equal to the difference in Dollars between the Final Adjustment Amount
and the Estimated Adjustment Amount. Any payments made pursuant to this
Section 2.3(e) shall be paid within five Business Days of the Determination
Date in accordance with Section 2.3(f).

(f) All payments made, or to be made, under this Agreement by a Party to the
other Party(ies) will be made by electronic transfer of immediately available
funds to the

receiving Party's account set forth on Schedule 2.3(f), or to such other bank
and account as may be specified by the receiving Party in writing to the
paying Party.

Section 2.4 Tax Classification; Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) For federal income Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the principles
of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2), (i) with respect to the
Sellers, as a conveyance of partnership interests to Buyer, and (ii) with
respect to Buyer, as an acquisition of all of the assets of the Company and
assumption by Buyer of all of the Company's liabilities (other than
liabilities for which Buyer is required to be indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement). Unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code, the Parties agree not to voluntarily take
any position on a U.S. federal income Tax Return or in any administrative or
judicial proceeding relating to the Tax reporting of the transactions under
this Agreement that is inconsistent with this Section 2.4(a) for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.

(b) For purposes of the Tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with respect to Buyer, as set forth in Section 2.4(a), Sellers shall
prepare a draft of the allocation schedule (the "Proposed Allocation
Schedule") taking into account Section 2.2(b) of the MOC Purchase Agreement
and allocating the Purchase Price, the liabilities of the Company and any
other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes
among the Company Assets and the Facilities for Tax purposes in a manner
consistent with the principles of Sections 1060 of the Code and the U.S.
Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law, as applicable). The Proposed Allocation Schedule shall be
delivered by the Sellers to the Buyer within 90 days after the Closing Date
for the Buyer's review, comments and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Buyer and the Sellers shall
work in good faith to promptly resolve any disputes relating to the Proposed
Allocation Schedule. If Sellers and Buyer fail to resolve any such dispute
within 30 days of delivery of the Proposed Allocation Schedule to the Buyer,
then Sellers and Buyer shall submit the items of the Proposed Allocation
Schedule in dispute for resolution to an independent valuation or accounting
firm of international reputation mutually acceptable to Sellers and Buyer,
which shall, as soon as practicable after such submission, determine and
report to Sellers and Buyer its resolution of the Proposed Allocation
Schedule. The report of such firm shall be final and binding upon the parties
hereto. The fees for such firm shall be borne equally between Sellers, on the
one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Proposed Allocation Schedule as
accepted or as finally agreed or determined shall be the "Final Allocation
Schedule." The Proposed Allocation Schedule or the Final Allocation Schedule
shall take into account any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, in
the manner consistent with the principles of Sections 1060 of the Code and the
U.S. Treasury Regulations thereunder. Each of the Parties agree to report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistently with the Final
Allocation Schedule on all applicable Tax Returns, including, with respect to
Buyer, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement, and
will not assert, and will cause its Affiliates not to assert, in connection
with any Tax Proceeding or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset
values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set forth on the Final
Allocation Schedule, unless with the agreement of the other Party(ies) or
otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a)(1) of the Code;

provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement will prevent a Party from
settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority based
upon or arising out of the allocation, and no Party will be required to
litigate before any Governmental Authority any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging the allocation, as applicable.
The Parties shall promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any
Tax Proceeding related to the Final Allocation Schedule.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, each of Buyer and
the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable under the terms of this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to any provision of Law related to
or regarding Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the
Acquired Companies under any provision of this Agreement, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Buyer or such Acquired Company to the
applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipients in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Buyer or the relevant Acquired Company to the extent such payment is remitted
to the applicable Governmental Authority. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Sellers the opportunity to review the decision
to withhold on any such payments made under this Agreement, and all parties
shall, to the extent reasonably possible, work together to avoid or reduce any
such withholding obligation.

filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other third party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents (whether or not such approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations are conditions
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents).

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Parties
will make or to cause its ultimate parent entity (as such term is defined in
the HSR Act) to make such filings as may be required by the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents as soon as reasonably practicable after the Execution
Date but in no event later than two Business Days after the Execution Date and
shall simultaneously file therewith a request for early termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Thereafter, the Parties will as
promptly as practicable respond to any requests for additional information
from any Governmental Authority concerning such transactions. Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the applicable waiting period specified in the HSR
Act to expire or to be terminated on or before the Outside Date, as extended.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties will cooperate to have the
applicable HSR Act waiting period expire on or before the Outside Date. If any
objections are asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents under the HSR Act or which would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, or if any
Legal Proceeding or action is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any
other Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents as violative of the HSR Act, or
an Order is issued temporarily or permanently enjoining any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, Buyer shall take any and all action necessary to resolve each and
every impediment to closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, including (i) selling or otherwise
disposing of, or holding separate, and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose
of or hold separate, assets, categories of assets or businesses of Buyer or
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies); (ii)
terminating existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies); (iii) terminating or entering into any venture or other
arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, and contractual rights and or
obligations of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Acquired Companies); (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations (and, in each
case, enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an Order or file
appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with





39

|

| 

any of the foregoing) and, in the case of actions by or with respect to
businesses or assets of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies and the Company Business), by consenting to such
actions relating to the Company Business (individually or in the aggregate, a
"Divestiture Action"); provided that any such Divestiture Action may, at the
discretion of the Sellers acting jointly, be conditioned upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents); and (vi) defending, contesting and resisting any Legal Proceeding
or action, to ensure that no Governmental Authority enters any Order,
decision, preliminary or permanent injunction, or establishes any Law or other
action restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or making illegal the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents or to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the
authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, fails to do so by the Outside Date. Buyer shall take no action that
could reasonably be expected to delay obtaining the expiration of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

(c) Buyer will pay the statutory filing fee(s) associated with filings under
the HSR Act.

(d) Each of the Parties shall, or shall cause their respective counsel to,
furnish the other Party(ies) with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Party(ies) may reasonably request in connection with
obtaining the necessary authorizations, approvals or consents as may
reasonably be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
with respect to the preparation of necessary filings or submissions. Each of
the Parties shall, or shall cause their respective counsel to, supply to the
other Party(ies) copies of all correspondence, filings or written
communications to or by such Party or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Authority or staff members thereof, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, except for
documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) and Item 4(d) of the HSR Notification
and Report Form (which shall be provided in the event any Governmental
Authority issues a request for additional information and documentary material
under the HSR Act) or communications regarding the same, documents or
information that reveal any Party's negotiating objectives, strategies or
purchase price expectations or a Party's communications containing information
covered by the attorney-client or work product privilege, unless the Parties
enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement. To the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the Parties will (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authority relating to obtaining the necessary authorizations,
approvals or consents as may reasonably be required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, including any such meetings and communications, (ii)
not participate independently in any such meeting or communication without
first giving the other Parties (or the other Parties' outside counsel) an
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or communication, (iii)
give the other Parties reasonable advance notice of all oral communications
with any Governmental Authority relating to obtaining the necessary
authorizations, approvals or consents as may reasonably be required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the





40




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

other Transaction Documents, provide an opportunity for the other Parties to
participate in such communication to the extent practicable and, if such
Parties cannot participate, promptly notify the other Parties of the substance
of such communication, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates an oral
communication regarding the obtaining the necessary authorizations, approvals
or consents as may reasonably be required in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, provide an opportunity for the other Parties to participate in such
communication to the extent practicable and, if such Parties cannot
participate, promptly notify the other Parties of the substance of such
communication, and (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, all written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to obtaining the
necessary authorizations, approvals or consents as may reasonably be required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents) with a Governmental Authority
regarding obtaining the necessary authorizations, approvals or consents as may
reasonably be required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; provided,
however, that each Party will be solely responsible for the final content of
any substantive oral or written communications of such Party with any
applicable Governmental Authority. The Parties shall jointly determine all
tactics and strategies relating to their compliance with this Section 6.2 and
obtaining the termination or expiration of any applicable HSR Act waiting
period, subject to each Party undertaking good faith consultations and taking
the view of the other Party(ies) into account. The Parties may take any
reasonable action to resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture Action if
undertaken in good faith, even if it delays such termination or expiration to
a date not beyond the Outside Date.

Section 6.3 Information, Access and Assistance.

(a) From the Execution Date through the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 9 and the Closing Date, upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and solely in furtherance of Buyer's investigation
of the Acquired Companies, the Company will afford Buyer and its authorized
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices,
properties, books and records, and officers of the Acquired Companies, and
will furnish Buyer with such additional information concerning the Acquired
Companies' businesses, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer will not be entitled to
conduct environmental sampling or testing, without the prior written consent
of the Company, Buyer being limited to visual inspections and certain
assessments of the properties and facilities of the Acquired Companies and the
review of their records and any other publicly available materials or
information with regard to these matters; (ii) Buyer will have no right of
access to, and none of the Sellers nor the Acquired Companies will have any
obligation to provide to Buyer, (A) information relating to bids received from
others in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids,
(B) any information the disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege
available to any Acquired Company, any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, (C) any information that the disclosure of which would cause a
breach a confidentiality obligation by any Acquired Company, any Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates, or (D) any





41




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

information, the disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law; and
(iii) without the prior written consent of the Company, Buyer will not contact
any suppliers to, or customers of, any Acquired Company with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that in such case, the Company
shall notify Buyer of such inability to provide information and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements or
seek appropriate waivers or consents. All information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.3 will be "Confidential Information" as such term is used in
the Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the terms thereof.

(b) Any inspection or investigation conducted by Buyer or its Representatives
prior to the Closing will be conducted in accordance with Law, including any
applicable Environmental Laws, and in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Acquired Companies. None
of the Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information (if any) provided pursuant to this Section 6.3, and Buyer may not
rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the representations and warranties contained in Article
3 (subject to the limitations in Section 6.22), Article 4 (subject to the
limitations in Section 6.22) and the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 6.3(b) will survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 9 and the Closing.

(c) If Buyer exercises rights of access under this Section 6.3(c) or
otherwise, or conducts examinations or inspections under this Section 6.3(c)
or otherwise, then (i) such access, examination and inspection will be at
Buyer's sole risk, cost and expense and Buyer waives and releases all Claims
against each Seller, each Acquired Company, each of their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective employees, directors, officers,
attorneys, contractors and agents (collectively, the "Inspection Indemnitees")
arising in any way therefrom or in any way related thereto or arising in
connection with the conduct of the Inspection Indemnitees and (ii) Buyer will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Inspection Indemnitees from and
against any and all Claims or Losses of any kind or character arising out of
this Section 6.3(c). THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION WILL APPLY
WHETHER OR NOT SUCH CLAIMS OR LOSSES ARISE OUT OF (A) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING
SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR KNOWING AND INTENTIONAL
MISCONDUCT) OF A SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR (B) STRICT LIABILITY.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.3(c) will survive the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 9 and the Closing.

Section 6.4 Public Announcements. The Parties agree that, except to the extent
necessary to comply with the requirements of Law or any listing agreements
with, or rules and regulations of, securities exchanges, no press release or
similar public announcement or communication will ever, whether prior to or
subsequent to the Closing, be made or caused to be made concerning the
existence or subject matter of this Agreement unless approved in advance by
the Buyer and the Sellers in writing; provided, that with respect to any press
release or similar





42




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

public announcement or communication for which advance approval is not
required in accordance with the foregoing, to the extent practicable,
reasonable notice and a copy of such release, announcement or communication
will be provided to Buyer or the Sellers, as applicable, prior to issuing the
same. If a Party desires to make an announcement to the general public, it
shall first give Buyer or the Sellers, as applicable, 48 hours written
notification of its desire to make such a public announcement. The written
notification shall include (a) a request for consent to make the announcement
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and (b) a written draft of the text of such public announcement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.4 will survive the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 9 and the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) The
Energy and Minerals Group LP and its Affiliates shall each have the right to
make customary disclosures to their respective advisors, Affiliates and direct
and indirect investors regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the consent of any other Party, (ii) Laredo and its
Affiliates (specifically, Laredo Petroleum, Inc.) shall have the right to make
public disclosure regarding the existence or subject matter of this Agreement
including by Current Report on Form 8-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or
Annual Report on Form 10-K, by press release and/or by corporate presentation
without notice to or the consent of any other Party, and (iii) Buyer and its
Affiliates shall each have the right to make customary disclosures (A) their
respective employees, accountants, advisors and other Representatives as
necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses and (B) their stockholders and their respective Affiliates in order
that such Persons may provide information about the subject matter of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their Affiliates and
their respective limited partners and investors and prospective limited
partners and investors in connection with their fundraising and reporting
activities, in each case without the consent of any other Party.

Section 6.5 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, each of the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to ensure the
satisfaction of its conditions to Closing set forth herein.

Section 6.6 Transfer Taxes. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
involve the transfer of the Membership Interests, which are intangible assets;
accordingly, the Parties do not expect any state and local transfer, sales,
use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes to arise by reason of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer
Taxes"). To the extent that any Transfer Taxes are assessed, such Transfer
Taxes will be borne by Buyer. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to
minimize, to the extent permissible under Law, the amount of any Transfer
Taxes.

Section 6.7 Tax.

(a) The Sellers shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies required to be filed
after the Closing Date and Internal Revenue Service Form 1065 (U.S. Return of
Partnership Income) and any





43




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

other "flow-through" income or similar Tax Return (including for the avoidance
of doubt, Internal Revenue Service Form 8804 and any comparable state form)
for any Pre-Closing Period of the Acquired Companies and shall pay the amount
of any Tax liability shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns directly to
the applicable Taxing Authority (except to the extent such amount was taken
into account as a liability in the final determination of the Adjustment
Amount). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with past practices of the Acquired Companies,
as applicable, with respect to such items, except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law. At least 15 days prior to the filing of any such
Tax Return, Sellers shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Buyer for its
review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably, withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(b) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns with respect
to the Acquired Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date for any
Straddle Period on a basis consistent with past practice, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of filing any such
Tax Return (which in the case of a Tax Return that relates to Income Taxes,
shall not be later than 15 days prior to such filing), Buyer shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Return, to each Seller for its review and approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer
will cause such Tax Return to be timely filed and will provide a copy to each
Seller. To the extent that Sellers are responsible for any Taxes for a
Straddle Period, as determined in accordance with Section 6.7(c), Sellers
shall pay the amount of such Taxes to Buyer on or before five days prior to
the due date of such Tax, except to the extent such amount was taken into
account as a liability in the final determination of the Adjustment Amount.

(c) For purposes of determining Seller Taxes with respect to any Straddle
Period of the Acquired Companies, the portion of any Tax for such Straddle
Period that is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall be:

(i) with respect to Taxes that are (A) Income Taxes, (B) imposed in connection
with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible) or (C) imposed on specific transactions, including
payroll Taxes, deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax
year of the Acquired Companies ended on the Closing Date; provided, that all
exemptions, allowances, or deductions for the Straddle Period which are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated in proportion to the number of days in such
period prior to and including the Closing Date; and

(ii) with respect to Property Taxes that are ad valorem, real property,
personal property or other Property Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

(d) The Parties agree to treat the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as causing the Company to terminate for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
accordance with Section 708 of the Code.

Section 6.8 Cooperation on Tax Returns and Tax Proceedings.

(a) The Parties will cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other Party(ies), in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a "Tax Proceeding") with respect
to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or activities of
the Acquired Companies. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon
the request of the other Party(ies)) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding this Section 6.8, the control and conduct of any Tax
Proceeding that involves an Asserted Liability will be governed by Section
10.5.

(b) Sellers, at their sole expense, shall have the authority to represent the
interests of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Tax Proceeding
relating solely to a Pre-Closing Period; provided that Sellers shall inform
Buyer of the status of any such Tax Proceeding, shall provide Buyer with
copies of any pleadings, correspondence, and other documents as Buyer may
reasonably request and shall consult with Buyer prior to the settlement of any
such Tax Proceeding and shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer prior
to the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that Buyer
shall have the right to participate in, but not direct, the prosecution or
defense of such Tax Proceeding at Buyer's sole expense. If Sellers do not
elect to control a Tax Proceeding pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), Buyer, at
Sellers' expense, shall have the sole right to control any such Tax Proceeding
and Sellers, at Sellers' expense, shall have the right to participate in any
such Tax Proceeding, and none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies, or any of
their respective Affiliates shall settle any such Tax Proceeding without the
written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

(c) Buyer shall control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes of
the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period at Buyer's expense; provided,
however, that Sellers shall be entitled to participate at their expense in any
such Tax Proceeding, and none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates shall settle any such Tax Proceeding without the written consent of
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.8(b) or Section 6.8(c), Buyer
shall have the sole right to control any Tax Proceeding relating to the
Acquired Companies.

Section 6.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payments made to
any Party pursuant to Article 10 shall constitute an adjustment of the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the Parties on
their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

Section 6.10 Non-Solicitation.

(a) Buyer covenants and agrees that, as an express incentive to induce each
Seller to enter into this Agreement, during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is two years following the Closing
Date, Buyer will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit any employee of Medallion Midstream, LLC or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any employees working for
an entity acquired pursuant to the MOC Purchase Agreement) for employment with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that this Section 6.10(a)
shall not preclude the Buyer or its Affiliates from soliciting for employment
or hiring any such employee who (i) responds to a general solicitation through
a general solicitation by or on behalf of the Buyer or its Affiliates that is
not targeted at such employees and (ii) has not been employed by Medallion
Midstream, LLC or its Subsidiaries for a period of six months prior to the
date such individual was first solicited for employment by Buyer or its
Affiliate.

(b) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, as an express incentive to induce
the Buyer to enter into this Agreement and the MOC Purchase Agreement, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of the
date that is four years following the Closing Date and the date of the Parent
Ultimate Exit, such Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any employee of the Company for
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that this
Section 6.10(b) shall not preclude (i) either Seller or its Affiliates from
soliciting any such employee for employment through a general solicitation
that is not targeted at such employees or (ii) soliciting or hiring any such
employee who has been terminated by the Company (other than for cause) at
least six months prior to the date such individual was first solicited for
employment by such Seller or its Affiliate.

(c) Each of Buyer and each Seller agrees and acknowledges that, in the event
of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 6.10, such Party and its
Affiliates (as third party beneficiaries) will, individually or collectively,
be entitled to injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause such Party
and its Affiliates irreparable injury for which they would have no adequate
remedy at law. Each of Buyer and each Seller also agrees to waive any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy. Nothing herein will be construed so as to prohibit any Party or
its Affiliates, collectively or individually, from pursuing any other remedies
available hereunder, at law or in equity, for any such breach or threatened
breach. The Parties agree that the foregoing restrictions in this Section 6.10
are reasonable in all respects and that any breach of the covenants contained
in this Section 6.10 would cause irreparable injury to the other Parties and
its Affiliates. Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found
by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or
overly broad as to scope or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the Parties
intend for the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.10 to be modified by
the court or arbitrator making such determination so as to be reasonable and
enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this
contractual modification prospectively at this time, the Parties intend to
make this provision enforceable under the Laws of all applicable states and
other jurisdictions so that the entire Section 6.10 as prospectively modified
will remain in full force and effect and will not be rendered void or illegal.

Section 6.11 Amendment to Schedules. Buyer agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 and Article 4, the
Company and Sellers shall have the continuing right until Closing to add,
supplement or amend the Schedules to its representations and warranties with
respect to any event, development, occurrence or non-occurrence of an event
hereafter first occurring, or any condition first existing, after the
Execution Date (and not resulting from the breach of any of the covenants or
agreements herein by the Company or Sellers), which, if such event had
occurred, or such condition had existed, prior to or on the Execution Date,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules (each,
a "Schedule Supplement"). If (a) Buyer has the right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) as a result of the facts or circumstances
disclosed in such Schedule Supplement and does not exercise such right within
five Business Days and (b) such Schedule Supplement relates to any event,
development, occurrence or non-occurrence of an event first occurring, or any
condition first existing, after the Execution Date (and not resulting from the
breach of any of the covenants or agreements herein by the Company or
Sellers), then, for the purpose of determining whether the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 7.1 have been met and for no other purpose,
such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to have amended the appropriate
Schedule or Schedules as of the Execution Date, to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or Article 4 as of the
Execution Date, and all references to the Schedules hereto shall be deemed to
include the information included in the Schedule Supplement.

Section 6.12 Casualty Loss.

(a) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing, all or any portion
of the Company Assets (i) are destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, earthquake,
storm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage, accident or any
other casualty of a similar nature (a "Casualty Loss") or (ii) becomes subject
to any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding (a "Condemnation"), and the
Restoration Cost reasonably estimated by the Company or Buyer exceeds
$10,000,000, then the Company shall notify Buyer promptly in writing of such
event (a "Casualty Notice") and the Company and Buyer will together promptly
select an independent third-party construction and engineering firm skilled in
designing and/or constructing assets of the type that suffered the Casualty
Loss or Condemnation, as applicable (an "Engineering Firm") who will be
engaged to determine the final Restoration Cost for purposes of Section
6.12(b). If the Company and Buyer are unable to agree upon an Engineering Firm
by the expiration of 15 days following the delivery of the Casualty Notice,
the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will select a
separate Engineering Firm to determine the Restoration Cost. If the two
Engineering Firms so selected do not agree on the final Restoration Cost, then
the two Engineering Firms will select a third Engineering Firm to determine
the final Restoration Cost. The final Restoration Cost will be the average of
the two Restoration Cost estimates that are the closest in amount relative to
each other. Each of the Company and Buyer will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any Engineering Firm engaged by such Party in accordance with
this Section 6.12(a) to return its determination of the final Restoration Cost
within 30 days after the date of such Engineering Firm's engagement by such
Party; provided that no Party may delay the Closing for the time periods set
forth in this Section 6.12(a) for the determination of the final Restoration
Cost.





47

|

| 

(b) If the final Restoration Cost exceeds $10,000,000, the Company shall
elect, by notice to Buyer within 30 days after the determination date of the
final Restoration Cost, to either (i) reduce the Purchase Price by the amount
that the final Restoration Cost exceeds $10,000,000 or (ii) repair, replace or
restore the affected Company Asset, prior to Closing and at Sellers' sole cost
and expense, to a condition comparable in all material respects to such
Company Asset's condition immediately prior to the Casualty Loss or
Condemnation, as applicable; provided that all insurance proceeds received by
the Sellers, any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates, whether
before or after the Closing, will be retained by or promptly paid to the
applicable Seller upon receipt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.12.

(c) The occurrence of a Casualty Loss or Condemnation after the Execution Date
but prior to the Closing will not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of the
Sellers' or the Company's representations and warranties, covenants or other
obligations under this Agreement absent some other breach of the
representations and warranties, covenants or other obligations of such Parties
under this Agreement.

(d) In the event of any Casualty Loss or Condemnation, the Parties agree, as
applicable, to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims and
collect any amounts to which an Acquired Company may be entitled under the
applicable insurance policies in respect of such Casualty Loss or
Condemnation.

Section 6.13 No Solicitation of Other Bids. Each of the Sellers and the
Company agrees that it will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(a) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding
an Acquisition Proposal; (b) enter into discussions or negotiations with any
Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any
agreements or other instruments to effect an Acquisition Proposal. Each of the
Sellers and the Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and
will cause its Affiliates and all of its and their Representatives to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction
of any due diligence materials provided to any Persons (other than Buyer and
its Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with any potential
Acquisition Proposal (subject to the terms of any applicable confidentiality
agreements with such Persons). For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal"
will mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer or
any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, membership interest exchange or other business combination
transaction involving the Acquired Companies; (ii) the issuance or acquisition
of membership interests or other equity securities in the Acquired Companies;
or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any material
portion of the Company Assets.

Section 6.14 [Reserved].

Section 6.15 Access to Information. After the Closing Date, Buyer will grant
to each Seller (or its Representatives), access at all reasonable times to all

and electronic files relating to the business of the Acquired Companies (the
"Records"), and will afford such Party the right to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to prepare such
Party's financial statements and tax and Securities and Exchange Commission
reports, implement the provisions of this Agreement, or to investigate or
defend any Claims among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising under this
Agreement, or for such other purpose as such Seller may reasonably request.
Buyer will maintain such Records until the seventh anniversary of the Closing
Date (or for such longer period of time as either Seller may reasonably
determine is necessary in order to have the Records available with respect to
Tax matters), or if any of the Records pertain to any Claim or dispute pending
on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will maintain any of the
Records designated by a Seller or its Representatives until such Claim or
dispute is finally resolved and the time for all appeals has been exhausted.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Seller will be entitled
to retain a copy of the Records after the Closing.

Section 6.16 Insurance Matters.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing Date (i)
the Sellers or their respective Affiliates may terminate coverage with respect
to the properties and assets of the Acquired Companies under any insurance
policies maintained by the Acquired Companies or with respect to which any
Acquired Company is a named insured or otherwise the beneficiary of coverage
(the "Seller Insurance Policies"); (ii) none of the properties or assets of
the Acquired Companies will be covered under Seller Insurance Policies
following the Closing Date; and (iii) Buyer shall become solely responsible
for procuring, maintaining and paying for all insurance policies with respect
to post-Closing issuance coverage for the properties and assets of the
Acquired Companies.

(b) The Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to receive
and retain any and all amounts paid to insured Persons pursuant to any Seller
Insurance Policy in respect of any insurance claim relating to the conduct of
the business of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date.

Section 6.17 Continuing Indemnification.

(a) Buyer agrees to cause each Acquired Company to ensure that all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of each
member, officer or manager of any Acquired Company, each member, manager,
shareholder, partner, or officer of any Affiliate of such member of any
Acquired Company, and each Person serving at the request of any Acquired
Company as a member, manager, officer, or director (or equivalent position) of
another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise (collectively, the "Member Indemnified Persons"), as
provided in the respective governing documents and indemnification agreements
to which any Acquired Company is a party on the date hereof, shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years from the Closing Date and the indemnification agreements and
the provisions with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability
set forth in such Organizational Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified (unless required by Law) in a manner that is adverse to any
such Person; provided, that in the event any





49




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

claim or claims are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims;
provided, further, that neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company shall be
required to indemnify or advance expenses to any Member Indemnified Person
except to the extent of any insurance proceeds that Buyer or such Acquired
Company actually receives from the tail policy contemplated to be acquired
pursuant to this Section 6.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Member
Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to indemnification and the
advancement of expenses with respect to a matter as contemplated above to the
extent such Member Indemnified Person is the subject of a claim for
indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in such Member Indemnified
Person's capacity as a Seller pursuant to Article 10. At the Closing, Sellers
shall cause the Company to purchase, and the Company at the Closing shall
purchase (at the Sellers' sole cost and expense, which shall be a Transaction
Expense) and maintain in effect for a period of six years thereafter, a tail
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance, which tail policy
shall be effective for a period from the Closing through and including the
date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing, and which tail policy
shall contain coverage, terms and conditions satisfactory to Sellers.

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Acquired Companies under this Section
6.17 shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to affect adversely any Member Indemnified Person to whom this
Section 6.17 applies without the consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of such affected Member Indemnified Person
(it being expressly agreed that the Member Indemnified Persons to whom this
Section 6.17 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.17,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.17).

(c) In the event Buyer, an Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or such Acquired Company, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.17. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Member Indemnified Person is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to any Acquired Company
or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that
the rights provided for in this Section 6.17 are not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 6.18 Company Guarantees. As soon as practicable after the Execution
Date, Buyer will obtain from the respective beneficiaries, effective as of the
Closing, the release of Sellers and their respective Affiliates from any of
the Company Guarantees listed in Schedule 6.18. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller and its Affiliates against any Losses incurred or
suffered by such Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to or arising out of
the





50




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

Company Guarantees listed in Schedule 6.18. Neither Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to keep any such Company
Guarantees in effect from and after the Closing.

Section 6.19 Use of Name and Marks.

(a) With respect to the ownership and use after the Closing of the names,
business names, trade names, brand names, registered and unregistered
trademarks, logos, service marks or any other similar indicia of origin (or
any variation or derivative of such names, business names, trade names, brand
names, registered and unregistered trademarks, logos, service marks or any
other similar indicia of origin confusingly similar thereto) (collectively,
the "Marks") of the Acquired Companies, including "Medallion", "Medallion
Midstream" and the "Medallion" logo (collectively, the "Company's Marks"), the
provisions of this Section 6.19 shall govern.

(b) Buyer and each Seller agrees as follows: (i) at Closing, the Sellers and
their Affiliates will assign and transfer (and do hereby transfer and assign)
to Buyer all of their entire worldwide rights, interest and title in and to
the Company's Marks, including all goodwill therein or arising therefrom (and
upon Buyer's request, will execute and deliver to Buyer a short-form trademark
assignment agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer for recordation
purposes only); and (ii) at Closing and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Section 6.19, Buyer shall a grant to the Sellers and their Affiliates a
transitional, non-exclusive, royalty-free, limited world-wide right and
license to use the Company's Marks (the "Marks License") for a period of 18
months following the Closing Date (the "License Term") solely in the manner
and for such uses that are in all material respects the same as such manner
and uses of the Company's Marks by Sellers and their Affiliates preceding the
date hereof and solely for purposes of allowing Sellers to phase out of use of
the Company's Marks. As soon as practicable following the Closing (but in no
event later than 90 days after the Closing), Sellers and their Affiliates
shall make all filings necessary to change their names to names that do not
include any of the Company's Marks or that comprise any colorable imitations
thereof or confusingly similar Marks. Upon expiration of the License Term,
each of the Sellers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (x) cease and
permanently discontinue any and all uses as indicia of origin of any of the
Company's Marks and any colorable imitations thereof or confusingly similar
Marks, and remove or cover all of the Company's Marks from or on, or destroy,
any publications, signage, corporate letterhead, invoices, stationery,
business cards, marketing materials, website content or other materials in the
possession or under the control of the Sellers and each of their Affiliates
bearing any of the Company's Marks; and (y) permanently remove any the
Company's Marks (including any colorable imitations thereof or confusingly
similar Marks) from all pipeline markers on the assets of Sellers or their
Affiliates.

(c) All use of the Company's Marks by any Seller or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to the Marks License during License Term shall be at all times
subject to the direction and control of Buyer and shall inure to the exclusive
benefit of Buyer. Sellers and their Affiliates shall, during the License Term,
comply with Buyer's instructions, directions and quality control requirements
at all times in connection with any use of the Company's Marks.

(d) In no event shall the Sellers or any of their Affiliates use any of the
Company's Marks after the expiration of the License Term in any manner or for
any purpose, including that none of them shall affix or include any of the
Company's Marks, or any colorable imitations thereof or confusingly similar
Marks, on any publications, signage, corporate letterhead, invoices,
stationery, business cards, marketing materials, website content or other
materials that are created or produced after the Closing. Each Seller, for
itself and its Affiliates, agrees that, after the Closing Date, and each
Seller and its Affiliates, respectively, will not represent themselves as
having any affiliation or business relationship with Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies), except pursuant to the Marks License or
any separate agreement entered into, or assumed by, Buyer or its Affiliates on
one hand, and such Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand.

(e) Buyer and each Seller expressly acknowledges and confirms that Sellers and
the Acquired Companies, respectively, are transferring and assigning, and
Buyer shall receive, all right, title or interest in or to the Company's Marks
and that subject to the Marks License granted to the Sellers for use of the
Company's Marks during the License Term in compliance with this Section 6.19,
all right, title and interest in the Company's Marks is expressly reserved by
Buyer.

Section 6.20 Non-Competition; Confidentiality.

(a) Each Seller agrees that for a period of 24 months from the Closing Date,
neither it nor any of its controlled Affiliates (it being agreed that nothing
in this Section 6.20 applies to (i) any of The Energy and Minerals Group LP, its
affiliated or associated investment funds or other entities or portfolio
companies, or any other Person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with such Persons or (ii) Laredo or its Affiliates (including Laredo
Petroleum, Inc.)) shall carry on, participate in, or be engaged in, either
directly or indirectly, as a principal or for its own account or solely or
jointly with others, or as members, partners or stockholders in any Person, in
the Restricted Business within the Restricted Area. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.20, a Seller may own, solely as an
investment, securities of a Person that is engaged in the Restricted Business
within the Restricted Area if (A) such Seller is not an Affiliate of the
issuer of such securities, (B) such Seller does not, directly or indirectly,
beneficially own more than five percent in the aggregate of such class of
securities and (C) such Seller has no active participation in such entity.

(b) Each Seller acknowledges that it is in possession of Confidential Material
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses
and operations. Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, treat confidentially and not disclose all or any portion
of such Confidential Material and will use such Confidential Material solely
for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and for no other purpose; provided, that the Company and its
Subsidiaries may also use the Confidential Material for the purpose of
operating their respective businesses in the ordinary course. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that such Confidential Material is proprietary and
confidential in nature and may be disclosed to its Representatives only to the
extent necessary for such Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (it being understood that each Seller shall be responsible
for any disclosure by any such





52




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

Representative not permitted by this Agreement). If any Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives are requested or required to disclose (after
such Seller has used its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such
disclosure and, to the extent legally permissible, after promptly advising and
consulting with Buyer about such Seller's intention to make, and the proposed
contents of, such disclosure) any of the Confidential Material (whether by
deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process), such Seller shall, or shall cause
such Affiliate or Representative, to provide Buyer with prompt written notice
of such request, to the extent legally permissible, so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. At any time that
such protective order or remedy has not been obtained, such Seller or such
Affiliate or Representative may disclose only that portion of the Confidential
Material which such Person is legally required to disclose or of which
disclosure is required to avoid sanction for contempt or any similar sanction,
and such Seller shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential
Material so disclosed. Each Seller further agrees that, from and after the
Closing Date, such Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives, upon the
request of Buyer or the Company, promptly will deliver to Buyer or the Company
all documents, or other tangible embodiments, constituting Confidential
Material or other information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, without retaining any copy thereof, and shall promptly destroy
all other information and documents constituting or containing Confidential
Material; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such Seller and its
Affiliates and Representatives shall not be required to deliver or destroy
copies of Confidential Material if such copies are necessary in order to
comply with applicable Law or reasonable business practice or corporate
retention policies or if such copies are electronic copies of Confidential
Material that are automatically generated through data back-up or archiving
systems and that are not readily accessible by such Seller or any of its
Affiliates and Representatives, provided that all such copies shall be subject
to this Section 6.20(b). Buyer acknowledges that Sellers and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives are active participants in the oil and gas
industry and may be actively seeking oil and gas related projects in a variety
of areas and, subject to Section 6.20(a), may be actively involved in oil and
gas activities in and around the area to which the Confidential Material
relates. Buyer understands that Sellers may retain certain mental impressions
of the Confidential Material which are or may be indistinguishable from
generalized industry knowledge. Accordingly, subject to Section 6.20(a), Buyer
agrees that Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall
not be precluded from pursuing or working on projects in and around such area
because of their knowledge or mental impressions of the Confidential Material
so long as Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives do not
use any Confidential Material in such endeavors.

(c) If any provision contained in this Section 6.20 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 6.20, but this Section 6.20 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time, which is not permitted by Law, or in any way construed to be too broad
or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null,
void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or
enforceable





53

|

| 

under Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or
reform this Section 6.20 to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such Law.
Each Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any breach
of this Section 6.20 and that there would be no adequate remedy at law or in
damages to compensate Buyer for any such breach. Buyer shall be entitled to
seek injunctive relief requiring specific performance by each Seller of this
Section 6.20.

Section 6.21 Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing or termination of
this Agreement, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, Sellers shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies and each of the Sellers', the Company's, such
Subsidiaries', and their respective Affiliates' directors, officers, managers,
representatives, auditors, and advisors to, provide reasonable cooperation to
Buyer and its Affiliates in the arranging of any debt financing of the Buyer,
the Company, or the Company's Subsidiaries, and to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts (a) to cause appropriate officers and
employees of the Acquired Companies (i) to be available on a customary basis
to meet with prospective lenders, rating agencies and investors in
presentations, meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions, (ii) to assist
with the preparation of disclosure documents, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, rating agency
presentations, projections and similar documents in connection therewith,
(iii) furnishing Buyer and its Financing Sources with financial statements and
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Acquired Companies as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer to consummate the financing, (iv) to
execute and deliver any definitive financing documentation, security
documents, hedging arrangements, customary certificates, legal opinions (which
may be reasoned, if counsel reasonably believes it cannot give the opinion
otherwise) or other documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the financing, in each case which will become effective only
on or after the Closing, (v) to take such reasonable actions as may be
required to facilitate the pledge of collateral to secure the financing
(including cooperation in connection with the pay‑off of existing Indebtedness
and the release of Liens related thereto), (vi) to obtain all waivers,
consents and approvals from other parties to contracts and liens to which the
Acquired Companies are a party or by which any of them or their assets or
properties are bound or subject, and (vii) to take all other actions necessary
to permit the consummation of the financing and (b) to cause the independent
certified public accountants of the Acquired Companies to provide assistance
to Buyer, including providing consent, on a customary basis, to Buyer to use
their audit reports relating to the Acquired Companies and, at the cost of
Buyer, to provide any necessary "comfort letters" and to prepare and deliver
other customary documents and instruments.

ARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION RIGHTS



Section 9.1 Termination Rights. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereunder abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers;

(b) by the Sellers or Buyer if there shall be in effect a final non-appealable
Order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to the Sellers, on the one
hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, if such Order was primarily due to the
failure of the Sellers or the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the
other hand, to perform any of their respective obligations under this
Agreement;

(c) by the Sellers in the event that there will have been a breach or
inaccuracy of Buyer's representations and warranties in this Agreement or a
failure by Buyer to perform its covenants in this Agreement, in any such case
in a manner that the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied (provided that none of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 or Article 4 will have
become and continue to be untrue in a manner that would cause the condition
set forth in Section 7.1(a) not to be satisfied and there has been no failure
by either Seller or the Company to perform their respective covenants in such
a manner as would cause the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) not to be
satisfied); provided, however, that the Sellers will provide notice to Buyer
as soon as practicable after becoming aware of any such breach, inaccuracy or
failure of Buyer; and provided further, that if such breach, inaccuracy or
failure is curable by Buyer through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts then, for up to 30 days from the date Buyer receives notice
of such breach, inaccuracy or failure from the Sellers, as long as Buyer
continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, the Sellers may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) prior to the later of
(x) the Outside Date or (y) the end of such 30-day period;

(d) by Buyer in the event that there has been a breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 or Article 4 or a
failure by either Seller or the Company to perform their respective covenants
in this Agreement, in any such case in a manner that the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b) would not be satisfied
(provided that none of the representations and warranties of the Buyer will
have become and continue to be untrue in a manner that would cause the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be satisfied and there has been
no failure by Buyer to perform its covenants in such a manner as would cause
the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied); provided,
however, that Buyer will provide notice to the Sellers and the Company as soon
as practicable





61




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

after becoming aware of any such breach or inaccuracy of the Sellers or the
Company, as applicable; and provided further, that if such breach or
inaccuracy is curable by the Sellers or the Company through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts then, for up to 30 days from the date the
Sellers and/or the Company receive notice of such breach or inaccuracy from
Buyer, as long as the Sellers and/or the Company continue to exercise such
commercially reasonable efforts, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(d) prior to the later of (x) the Outside Date or (y) the end
of such 30-day period; or

(e) by either Buyer or the Sellers following the Outside Date (as extended);
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e)
will not be available to any Party whose breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement will have been the cause of,
or will have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Outside Date; provided, further, that, notwithstanding such breach, any Party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement 60 days following the Outside
Date (as extended) if the non-breaching Party has not as of such date
commenced proceedings seeking to compel specific performance by the breaching
Party of one or more of its obligations contained in this Agreement.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, all obligations of the Parties will
terminate, except for the provisions of this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section
6.3(b), Section 6.3(c), Section 6.4, Section 6.22 and Article 11; provided
that the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect
following any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 9.

Section 9.3 Remedies.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) Section 9.1(c) upon
Buyer's breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or (ii) Section 9.1(e) and at such time Sellers had the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c), then Sellers shall, at
their option, mutually agree to either (x) terminate this Agreement and
receive the Reverse Termination Fee or (y) seek to obtain in any court of
competent jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any violation by Buyer of
its covenants contained in this Agreement or to seek to compel specific
performance by Buyer of one or more of its obligations contained in this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances when the
Reverse Termination Fee is payable, Sellers' receipt of the Reverse
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers and its
Affiliates. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Buyer fails to
effect the Closing for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this
Agreement or fails to perform hereunder, then except for an order of specific
performance only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 9.3(b), the sole
and exclusive remedy (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates for any
breach, Loss, liability or damage shall be for Sellers to terminate this
Agreement and, to the extent applicable, receive the Reverse Termination Fee.
For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers and the Company will be entitled to seek
specific performance of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.3(b) while
also seeking payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, but Sellers and the
Company shall not be entitled to both obtain specific performance to cause the
Closing to occur





62




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

and also receive the Reverse Termination Fee. It is agreed that the Reverse
Termination Fee is liquidated damages and not a penalty, and the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee in the circumstances specified herein is supported
by due and sufficient consideration.

(b) Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Parties
hereunder, each Party acknowledges that a breach of, conflict with, or failure
to perform or comply with, any of the provisions contained in this Agreement
would result in material irreparable injury to the other Party(ies) or their
respective Affiliates for which there is no adequate remedy at law and that it
will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely.
Accordingly, the Parties agree that they shall be entitled to equitable
relief, including in the form of an injunction or injunctions, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which any Party is entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree (i)
to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other Party to obtain any such
equitable remedy, (ii) to waive any requirement for the security or posting of
any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy and (iii) not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid or contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that such right of specific performance is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant Section 9.1(b), Section 9.1(c), Section
9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e), nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any
liability for Fraud by such Party and all rights and remedies of a non-
breaching Party under this Agreement in the case of any such Fraud, at Law and
in equity, shall be preserved, including the right to recover reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses; provided, that the Sellers shall not be entitled
to receive both the Reverse Termination Fee and also pursue damages for Fraud.
Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 9.3, the Parties agree
that, if this Agreement is terminated, the Parties shall have no liability to
each other under or relating to this Agreement.

Section 10.4 Limitations.

(a) None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to assert any
right to indemnification under Section 10.2(a), Section 10.2(c) or Section
10.2(e) with respect to a claim or series of related claims if such claim or
series of related claims arising out of the same or similar set of facts or
circumstances where the Losses related thereto are less than $200,000 (each, a
"De Minimis Loss"). No Seller, Laredo Indemnifying Party or Medallion
Indemnifying Party will have any liability pursuant to Section 10.2(a),
Section 10.2(c) or Section 10.2(e) until the aggregate amount of all Losses,
not including any De Minimis Losses, actually incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to such matters exceeds 0.75% of the Purchase
Price (the "Deductible"), in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
have the right to seek indemnification for all Losses in excess of, but not
including, the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set
forth in this Section 10.4(a) shall not apply to Excepted Losses.

(b) Subject to Section 10.4(e) and Section 10.4(h), the aggregate liability of
the Medallion Indemnifying Parties, on the one hand, and the Laredo
Indemnifying Parties, on the other hand, under Section 10.2(a), Section
10.2(c) or Section 10.2(e) shall be limited to the applicable Seller's (and
with respect to the Medallion Indemnifying Parties, Medallion's, and with
respect to Laredo Indemnifying Parties, Laredo's) Pro Rata Percentage of (i)
the Indemnity Cap with respect to all representations and warranties set forth
in Articles 3 and 4 of this Agreement and in Articles 3 and 4 of the MOC
Purchase Agreement other than the Fundamental Representations, the Special
Indebtedness Representations, the Special Material Contracts Representations,
Section 3.13 and Section 3.11 of the MOC Purchase Agreement, (ii) the Special
Indemnification Cap with respect to the Special Indebtedness Representations
and the Special Material Contracts Representations, and (iii) the Purchase
Price with respect to the Fundamental Representations. The aggregate liability
of Medallion, on the one hand, and Laredo, on the other hand, under Section
10.2(b), Section 10.2(d) or Section 10.2(f) shall be limited to the applicable
Seller's Pro Rata Percentage of the Purchase Price. Except as further limited
by this Section 10.4(b), Section 10.4(e) and Section 10.4(h), the aggregate
liability of the Medallion Indemnifying Parties, on the one hand, and the
Laredo Indemnifying Parties, on the other hand, with respect to all claims for

indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the indemnified Person to
the indemnifying Person with respect thereto prior to 5:00 P.M. Central Time
on the date pursuant to Section 10.1 on which the survival period of the
applicable representations and warranties or covenants expires, to assert a
Claim for indemnification describing such Claim in reasonable detail,
including the factual





66




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

circumstances giving rise to and the provisions under this Agreement on which
such Claim is based. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claim for
indemnification under this Agreement that is duly brought prior to such time
will survive until such matter is resolved.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any Party or any of its Affiliates be entitled to
recover more than one time for any Loss under this Agreement, and to the
extent a Party or any of its Affiliates is compensated for a matter through
the adjustments provided for in Section 2.3 or otherwise, such Party and its
Affiliates will not have a separate right to indemnification for such matter.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be entitled to duplicative
recovery under this Section 6.8 and Article 10 with respect to any Tax
Proceeding.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall (i) the aggregate liability of The Energy and Minerals Group Fund
II, L.P. with respect to any claim for indemnification exceed 73.7218% of
Medallion's Pro Rata Percentage of such claim, (ii) the aggregate liability of
EMG Fund II Offshore Holdings, LP with respect to any claim for
indemnification exceed 12.9552% of Medallion's Pro Rata Percentage of such
claim, aggregate liability and (iii) the aggregate liability of EMG Fund II
Dutch Offshore Holdings, LP with respect to any claim for indemnification
exceed 13.3229% of Medallion's Pro Rata Percentage of such claim.

(f) The Medallion Indemnifying Parties hereby agree and covenant that
Medallion will not distribute, pay or otherwise dispose of, and will retain,

(other than payments pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement), (i) for a period of 60 days following the Closing, an aggregate
amount representing 50% of such proceeds, (ii) for a period of 9 months
following the Closing, an aggregate amount representing 10% of such proceeds,
and (iii) for a period of 15 months following the Closing, an aggregate amount
representing 7.5% of such proceeds.

(g) With respect to the matters set forth on Schedule 3.5, the Sellers will be
entitled to control and appoint counsel for the defense of such matters. The
Sellers will keep Buyer advised of the status of such matters and the defense
thereof on a reasonably current basis and will consider in good faith the
recommendations made by Buyer with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Sellers will obtain the prior written consent of Buyer before
entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the
validity of any such matter if the settlement (i) requires an admission of
guilt, fault, culpability, failure to act or wrongdoing on the part of any
Buyer Indemnified Party, (ii) subjects any Buyer Indemnified Party to
liability that is not indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iii), (iii) does
not unconditionally release the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such matter and any related
matter, (iv) imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against any Buyer
Indemnified Party, (v) imposes any continuing obligation or payment
requirement on any Buyer Indemnified Party, or (vi) does not include as a term
that such settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement shall remain
confidential. Following the final resolution of the matters set forth on
Schedule 3.5, (a) if the aggregate Losses with respect to such matters are
less than any Current Liabilities with respect to such matters





67




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

taken into account for purposes of calculating the Final Adjustment Amount,
Buyer will pay to the Sellers, in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages,
the difference in Dollars between the aggregate Losses with respect to such
matters and any Current Liabilities with respect to such matters taken into
account for purposes of calculating the Final Adjustment Amount, or (b) if the
aggregate Losses with respect to such matters are greater than any Current
Liabilities with respect to such matters taken into account for purposes of
calculating the Final Adjustment Amount, such Losses shall be subject to the
indemnity pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(iii).

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the definitions of Excepted
Losses, Fundamental Representations, Material Adverse Effect, Special
Indebtedness Representations, Transaction Documents and Facilities, (i) in no
event will the Laredo Indemnifying Parties indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party and have no liability to or indemnify Holdings, Medallion Indemnified
Parties or other Medallion Indemnifying Parties, from any Losses in connection
with, arising out of or resulting from the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty in Article 3 or Article 4 of the MOC Purchase
Agreement, any non-fulfillment or breach by MOC, Medallion Midstream, LLC or
MOC Holdings, LLC of any covenant or agreement contained in the MOC Purchase
Agreement or any MOC Seller Taxes or their impact on the Company's
representations, covenants or otherwise, and (ii) the Medallion Indemnifying
Parties shall be responsible for the full amount of any Losses (not just their
Pro Rata Percentage of such Losses) but subject to the other limitations set
forth herein (including, without limitation, Medallion's aggregate liability
as set forth in Section 10.4(b)) for indemnifying the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from any Losses in connection with, arising out of or resulting from
the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty in Article 3 or
Article 4 of the MOC Purchase Agreement, any non-fulfillment or breach by MOC,
Medallion Midstream, LLC or MOC Holdings, LLC of any covenant or agreement
contained in the MOC Purchase Agreement or any MOC Seller Taxes.

Section 10.5 Claims Procedures.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party or
circumstances which, with the lapse of time, such indemnified Person believes
is likely to give rise to a Claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party or of
facts causing any indemnified Person to believe it has a Claim for
indemnification hereunder (an "Asserted Liability"), such indemnified Person
will give prompt written notice thereof (the "Claim Notice") to the relevant
indemnifying Person; provided that in any event, such indemnified Person will
give the Claim Notice to the indemnifying Person no later than 30 days after
becoming aware of such Asserted Liability. As long as the Claim Notice is
given in accordance with Section 10.4(c), the failure to so notify the
indemnifying Person will not relieve the indemnifying Person of its
obligations or liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure
prejudices the indemnifying Person. The Claim Notice will describe the
Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and will indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered. The
indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person agree to keep each other
reasonably appraised of any additional information concerning any Asserted
Liability.





68

|

| 

(b) As to an Asserted Liability arising from a third party action, the
indemnifying Person will be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 10.5, entitled to assume control of and appoint lead counsel for such
defense only for as long as it conducts such defense with reasonable
diligence; provided, that the indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the indemnified Person if (A) such Asserted Liability may give
rise to Losses which are more than 200% of the Indemnity Cap or Special
Indemnification Cap, as applicable, at the time such claim is submitted by the
indemnified Person; (B) such Asserted Liability for indemnification relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (C) such Asserted Liability seeks an injunction
or equitable relief against the indemnified Person; (D) the indemnified Person
has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of
a conflict of interest between the indemnifying Person and the indemnified
Person; or (E) upon petition by the indemnified Person, the appropriate court
rules that the indemnifying Person failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend such Asserted Liability; provided further, that if both
Sellers are indemnifying Persons with respect to an Asserted Liability arising
from a third party action, the Sellers must mutually agree with respect to
assuming control of the defense of any third party action and appointing lead
counsel for such defense. The indemnifying Person will keep the indemnified
Persons advised of the status of such third party action and the defense
thereof on a reasonably current basis and will consider in good faith the
recommendations made by the indemnified Persons with respect thereto. If the
indemnifying Person assumes the control of the defense of any third party
action in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.5, the indemnified
Person will be entitled to participate in the defense of any such third party
action and to engage, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying Person will
continue to control such defense; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
the indemnifying Person will pay the reasonable costs and expenses of such
defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the indemnified Persons if
(x) the indemnified Person's outside counsel will have reasonably concluded
and advised in writing (with a copy to the indemnifying Person) that there are
defenses available to such indemnified Person that are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying Person, or (y) the
indemnified Person's outside counsel will have advised in writing (with a copy
to the indemnifying Person) the indemnified Person that there is a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel for the indemnifying Person and
the indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Person
will obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified Person before
entering into any settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the
validity of such Asserted Liability if the settlement requires an admission of
guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified Person, subjects the
indemnified Person to criminal liability or does not unconditionally release
the indemnified Person from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such Asserted Liability or the settlement imposes injunctive or other
equitable relief against, or any continuing obligation or payment requirement
on, the indemnified Person.

(c) Each Party will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted
Liability arising from a third party action and will furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable
confidentiality agreement), and attend such

|

| 

conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(d) In the case of a Claim not based upon a third party action ("Direct
Claim"), the indemnifying Person shall have 60 days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to either (i) admit its obligation to provide indemnification or
(ii) dispute the Claim for indemnification, and provide a written explanation
for its position and supporting documentation (it being understood that during
such 60-day period such indemnifying Person shall have the right to
investigate such Direct Claim and seek to cure the underlying breach, fact, or
circumstance giving rise thereto; except that such indemnifying Person may not
and shall not hold itself out as the agent or representative of the
indemnified Person or otherwise bind or purport to bind the indemnified Person
or any of its Affiliates in connection with such investigation or cure). In
the event that the indemnifying Person disputes a Claim Notice for a Direct
Claim, the Parties, including appropriate management representatives, shall
promptly seek to negotiate a resolution in good faith. If the Parties are
unable to resolve the dispute within 90 days after the indemnifying Person
first receives the Claim Notice for a Direct Claim, then the indemnified
Person may seek any remedy available to it under this Agreement. If the
indemnifying Person fails to respond to the Claim Notice relating to a Direct
Claim within such 60 day period, then the indemnifying Person shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnity for all reasonable costs
and expenses relating to the Direct Claim referenced in the Claim Notice.

(e) To the extent any of the provisions of Section 6.8 conflict with the
provisions of this Section 10.5, Section 6.8 shall control with respect to any
Tax Proceeding.

Section 10.6 Waiver of Remedies.

(a) The Parties hereby agree that from and after the Closing, other than in
the case of Fraud, no Party will have any liability, and no Party will (and
each Party will cause its respective Affiliates not to) make any Claim, for
any Loss or any other matter, under, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the MOC Purchase Agreement (including breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement) or any other contract or other matter
delivered pursuant hereto, or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Law or otherwise, except for
(i) a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 or (ii) a claim
for specific performance, and this Article 10 and specific performance are the
sole and exclusive remedies available to the Parties and any other Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to Section 6.3(c), Section 6.8,
Section 6.12, Section 6.17, Section 6.18 and Section 11.16 of this Agreement
and Section 6.7, Section 6.11 and Section 10.16 of the MOC Purchase Agreement.

(b) IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, OTHER THAN IN THE CASE OF FRAUD, BUYER
HEREBY WAIVES AND RELEASES FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED UNDER LAW, AND AGREES NOT TO SUE, FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS (OTHER THAN
CLAIMS FOR EQUITABLE RELIEF RELATED TO THE BREACH OF ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT
OF ANY SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRING PERFORMANCE AFTER THE

CLOSING DATE, MAY HAVE AGAINST ANY SELLER, MEDALLION MIDSTREAM, LLC, MOC
HOLDINGS, LLC, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE ACQUIRED
COMPANIES AND MOC WITH RESPECT TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, OR ANY
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR ADVISORS
RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM (I) THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, OR (II) THE COMPANY BUSINESS (AS DEFINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MOC PURCHASE AGREEMENT), THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS (AS DEFINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MOC PURCHASE AGREEMENT), OR THE ASSETS OF THE
ACQUIRED COMPANIES OR MOC, INCLUDING THE COMPANY ASSETS, OR (III) ANY ACTIONS
OR OMISSIONS BY ANY OFFICER, DIRECTOR OR EMPLOYEE OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES,
MOC, ANY SELLER, MEDALLION MIDSTREAM, LLC, MOC HOLDINGS, LLC OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, IN SUCH PERSON'S CAPACITY AS SUCH, BY ANY SELLER, IN
ITS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE CLOSING, OR BY MEDALLION
MIDSTREAM, LLC OR MOC HOLDINGS, LLC, IN ITS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF MOC PRIOR
TO THE CLOSING, PROVIDED ANY SUCH ACTIONS WERE TAKEN OR OMISSIONS WERE
AVOIDED, IN EACH CASE, IN GOOD FAITH, EXCEPT PURSUANT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION
PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 10 AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT
ARISING FROM ANY SELLER'S, MEDALLION MIDSTREAM, LLC'S, MOC HOLDINGS, LLC'S OR
ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES' SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING ("NON-REIMBURSABLE
DAMAGES"): SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT
DAMAGES (EXCLUDING DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR THE DIMINUTION OF THE
VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES' ASSETS OR MOC'S ASSETS, IN EACH
CASE, THAT ARE THE NATURAL AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCE OF A BREACH AND DIRECTLY
FLOW FROM SUCH BREACH), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S OR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES' SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER FAULT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES
PURSUANT TO A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY WILL NOT BE DEEMED NON-REIMBURSABLE
DAMAGES.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Seller
hereby waives and acknowledges that it shall not exercise or assert, any right
of contribution or





71




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

right to indemnity or any other right or remedy against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or MOC in connection with any indemnification obligation or
any other liability to which a Seller may become subject under this Agreement.

Section 10.7 Determination of Amount of Damages; Mitigation.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 will be limited to the Losses suffered by the indemnified Person
and will be computed net of (i) any insurance or other proceeds entitled to be
received by the indemnified Person in connection with such Losses, (ii) any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment the indemnified Person is
entitled to receive from any Person with respect to such Loss, and (iii) any
other payment or monetary recoupment received, realized or retained by the
indemnified Person as a result of the events giving rise to the Claim. Any
indemnified Person that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to seek
indemnification hereunder will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
claims and collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance
policies or from third parties (pursuant to indemnification agreements or
otherwise) and will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Losses; provided that the indemnified Person will promptly notify either (i)
the Sellers, if such indemnified Person is Buyer, or (ii) Buyer, if such
indemnified Person is a Seller, in each case, of any efforts to mitigate;
provided, further, that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not require
any indemnified Person to commence any litigation, make any material monetary
expenditure, or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party, and any expenditures using such commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses shall constitute Losses hereunder. If
any third party recovery or insurance recovery is realized after having
previously received indemnity Claim proceeds hereunder, such indemnified
Person will promptly tender to the respective indemnifying Person an amount
equal to such third party recovery or insurance recovery.

(b) The Parties agree that no indemnified Person shall have any recourse under
this Article 10 for any Losses that such indemnified Person would not have
suffered had such indemnified Person exercised commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate such Losses within a reasonable amount of time following the
discovery by such indemnified Person of the fact, event or circumstance giving
rise to such Losses (and for an indemnified Person that is not a natural
Person, the bringing to the attention of a responsible officer thereof of such
fact, event or circumstance).

ARTICLE 11

the prior written consent of such Financing Sources.

Section 11.6 No Waiver. No waiver by a Party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement will be deemed or will constitute a waiver of any other provision

waiver unless expressly provided. No waiver will be effective unless made in
writing and signed by the Party to be charged with such waiver.

Section 11.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement will be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law
principles that would require the application of the Laws of any other
jurisdiction.

(b) Each Party agrees that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for
any disputes between any of the Parties arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be in any state or federal court in
Houston, Texas, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any Legal Proceeding arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Parties further agree that the Parties will not bring suit with respect to
any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts.
Each Party agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller shall be entitled to enforce the
provisions of Section 6.10 in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 11.7(b).

(d) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court referred to in Section 11.7(b). Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in clause (b) or in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any legal action, suit or proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against any of Buyer's or its Affiliates' Financing
Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to

Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

Section 11.8 Jury Waiver. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW THAT CANNOT BE
WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, THE RIGHT TO A JURY
IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY DEBT FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE) OR THE

hereunder including Section 6.11, Section 6.17 and Article 10, this Agreement

any other Person whomsoever or whatsoever, it being the intention of the

provided in this Section 11.9 and Sections 11.1, 11.5, 11.7(e), 11.8 and 11.20
shall be enforceable by the Financing Sources, their respective Affiliates and

assigned in this Agreement. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other

Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
define or limit any of the terms and provisions hereof.

remedies, and defenses to which such Party is or may be entitled arising from
or out of this Agreement or as otherwise provided by Law.

Section 11.16 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other Party(ies) would be damaged irreparably in the event

their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the

compliance with Section 11.7, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the provisions of this

with regard to either Party other than for federal and applicable state income

Section 11.19 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Attorney Client
Privilege.

(a) Buyer shall not assert, and after Closing, agrees to cause each Acquired
Company and their respective Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after
the Closing, of the Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates (excluding,
after Closing, the Acquired Companies), or any officer, manager, employee or
director of the Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates in any matter
involving Buyer, or its Affiliates (after Closing, including the Acquired
Companies), or this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any litigation,
arbitration, mediation or other Proceeding), by Locke Lord LLP and Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, which firms are representing Medallion and Laredo,
respectively, in connection with the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.





77

|

| 

(b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever, including email communications, between or among Locke Lord
LLP or Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, as applicable, and internal legal
counsel of Medallion and its Affiliates (collectively, "Medallion Counsel") or
Laredo and its Affiliates, as applicable (collectively, "Laredo Counsel"), on
the one hand, and any Acquired Company and the Sellers, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, on the other hand, that relate in
any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising in connection with this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all of the client files,
records and attorney work product in the possession of Medallion Counsel or
Laredo Counsel, as applicable, related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, collectively, the "Privileged Communications") shall be
deemed to be attorney-client privileged and that the Privileged Communications
and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to
Medallion or Laredo, as applicable, shall be controlled by such Seller and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Acquired Companies.

(c) As to any such Privileged Communications occurring prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees that none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns will after the Closing use or
rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or
involving the Sellers or their respective Affiliates. The Privileged
Communications may be used by the Sellers and/or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates in any way to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in any claim for indemnification
brought by Buyer Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Buyer, any Acquired Company and a third
party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege and/or attorney work product protections to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Medallion Counsel or Laredo
Counsel, as applicable, to such third party; provided, however, that the
Acquired Companies may not waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the applicable Seller. In the event that Buyer or any Acquired
Company is legally required by order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy
of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, Buyer shall immediately
(and, in any event, within two Business Days) notify the applicable Seller in
writing (including by making specific reference to this section) so that such
Seller can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Medallion
Counsel or Laredo Counsel, as applicable, constitute property of its clients,
only the applicable Seller shall hold such property rights and Medallion
Counsel or Laredo Counsel, as applicable, shall have no duty to reveal or
disclose any such files or other materials or any Privileged Communications by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Medallion Counsel or Laredo
Counsel, as applicable, on the one hand, and any Acquired Company, on the
other hand.

(e) Buyer agrees that it will not, and that after Closing it will cause each
Acquired Company not to, (i) access or use the Privileged Communications,
including by way of





78




 

--- 
| | 

|

| 

review of any electronic data, communications or other information, or by
seeking to have the Sellers waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or
by otherwise asserting that Buyer or any such Acquired Company has the right
to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the
Privileged Communications from Medallion Counsel or Laredo Counsel, as
applicable.

Section 11.20 No Recourse; Release.

(a) Except as may be expressed in this Agreement, or the Equity Commitment
Letter and Limited Guarantee delivered in connection herewith (and then only
to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such party to the
Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guarantee and not otherwise), this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit or other
legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be
brought against the Persons that are expressly named as Parties hereto and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such Person. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, Financing Source, or other Representative of any Party hereto
or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their successors or
permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim or action based on,
in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Effective immediately upon the Closing, each Seller on behalf of itself
and its officers, directors, equityholders, subsidiaries and Affiliates, and
each of their respective successors and assigns hereby unconditionally waives,
acquits, forever discharges and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, Buyer, each Acquired Company and each Affiliate of the foregoing and the
subsidiaries, direct and indirect equity holders, directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns of the
foregoing and their respective Affiliates (each, a "Releasee") of, from and
against any and all actions, claims, causes of action, demands, damages,
judgments, debts, dues, suits, liabilities and obligations of every kind,
nature and description whatsoever, whether accrued or fixed, known or unknown,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, or determined or determinable,
which such Seller ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter,
cause or thing whatsoever, in respect of such Seller's standing as a former
purchaser and/or holder (directly or indirectly) of the Membership Interests,
and each Seller shall not assert any claim against the Releasees in respect of
such released matters; provided that the following shall not be considered
released claims: (i) claims arising under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document (including indemnification claims), (ii) subject to
Section 6.17, any rights to indemnification or reimbursement from any Acquired
Company whether pursuant to its Organizational Documents, contracts or
otherwise and whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after,
the date hereof, (iii) any rights to earned but unpaid salary through the date
hereof (including unreimbursed travel or other expenses consistent with the
Company's reimbursement policies for such expenses) or to benefits under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement and (iv) the filing of any claims under
state workers' compensation or unemployment laws, or claims which by legal
requirement cannot be waived, including rights to file a charge with an
administrative agency or participate in an agency investigation.
