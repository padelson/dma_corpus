NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate

party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions by the party entitled to

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing by the party entitled to the benefit
of such condition), the Closing shall occur (i) on the date following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of such conditions that is
the earliest to occur of (A) a date during the Marketing Period to be
specified by Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days' notice to the
Company and (B) the final day of the Marketing Period, or (ii) at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may

the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall file with the Delaware Secretary of
State the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time that
the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State, or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein
and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Each of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to be identical to the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub, respectively, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that, in each case, (i) references to the name of
Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving
Corporation, (ii) Merger Sub shall, or Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, make any modifications necessary to
comply with _Section 6.05_ , and (iii) the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub relating to the incorporator of Merger Sub shall
be omitted.

  



  

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their death,

  



    

  



    

2

 



    

resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

Article II 
  
  _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent_ 
  _Entities; Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

  

Section 2.01   _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

    

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Treasury Stock; Conversion of
Subsidiary-Owned Stock_.

  



  

(i) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
that is owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(ii) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall equal
the ownership percentage of such Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.02_ and
_Section 2.03_ , each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled or converted into shares of the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with _Section 2.01(b)_ , Company Options, shares of Company RSUs, and Company
Performance Stock Units treated in accordance with _Section 6.04_ and, except
as provided in _Section 2.03_ , any shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are

  



    

3

 



    

held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Common
Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has
neither failed to perfect, nor effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")) shall be converted
into the right to receive $84.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of
shares in book-entry form (such shares, " _Book-Entry Shares_ ")) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, including by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, readjustment or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is
based upon the number of shares of Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the holders of Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

Section 2.02  _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. No later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company that is organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Article II_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, as needed, for payment in
accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash to pay the
Merger Consideration due pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_. All such cash
deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_." Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_ to pay for shares of
Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been properly perfected and not
withdrawn or lost shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

  



  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days after
the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise
provide in the case of Book-Entry Shares, to each holder of record of Common
Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title
shall pass (A) with respect to shares of Common Stock evidenced by
Certificates, only upon the proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 2.02(i)_ , if applicable) and
a validly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent (and such other
documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) and (B) with respect to
Book-Entry Shares, only upon proper delivery of an "agent's message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such
other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of Book-Entry
Shares or Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

  



    

4

 



    

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon
(i) in the case of shares of Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto (or affidavits in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.02(i)_ , if applicable) or (ii) in the case of shares
of Common Stock held as Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together with such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Common Stock have been converted
pursuant to _Section 2.01_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share representing such Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent
(or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer)
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c_ ), each share of Common
Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time
from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of shares of Common
Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section
2.01(c_ ). No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
surrender of the Certificates (or shares of Common Stock held as Book-Entry
Shares).

  



  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II _ upon
conversion of any shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates (or evidence of Book-Entry Shares) that evidenced ownership of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Common Stock
(or shares of Common Stock held as Book-Entry Shares) are presented to Parent
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Common Stock nine months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any
holder of Common Stock who has not theretofor complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law).

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. To the fullest extent permitted
by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would

  



    

5

 



    

otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such
Merger Consideration and any other amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Common Stock shall become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by,
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of domestic commercial banks
with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual or money market funds
investing in such assets, and in any case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity that may prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the
rights of any of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are
losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for
any other reason below the level required to make the payments required to be
paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments
when due.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Performance Stock Units), such
amounts as are required to be withheld under the Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall use reasonable best
efforts to reduce or eliminate any such withholding by requesting any
appropriate Tax forms, including Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ")
Form W-9 or the appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar
information, from the Company's stockholders.

  



  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.03  _Dissenter 's Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Dissenting
Shares shall be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_ , and instead the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section
262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to timely
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's
right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL, in which case such
stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.01_ , without interest thereon, in exchange for
such shares of Common Stock, and such shares of Common Stock shall no longer
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares) and to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the DGCL (the " _Dissenter 's Rights_"). In
such case, at the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except with respect to Dissenter's Rights and as provided in this
_Section 2.03_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall have
failed to timely perfect or shall have otherwise waived, or
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal under the
Dissenter's Rights, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the Dissenter's Rights,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares under the Dissenter's Rights shall cease, such shares shall
no longer be considered Dissenting Shares for purposes hereof, and such
holder's shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, as provided in _Sections 2.01_
and _2.02_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal by any holder of shares of Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to the Dissenter's Rights, and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or unless otherwise
required by a final non-appealable order of a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate, any such demands or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Article III 
  
  _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company at or before the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in
this _Article III_ , and the disclosure in any section or subsection shall be
deemed to qualify any other section in this _Article III_ to the extent that
it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure

  



  

   

7

Company required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or
otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger and any
premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith, including the Company
Credit Agreement and any fees related thereto and (iii) to pay all fees,
costs and expenses required to be paid by Parent related to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true, accurate and complete
copies of the fully executed debt commitment letter, together with
all schedules and exhibits thereto, from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc. (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), dated as of the date hereof (including
all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (and together with
any Fee Letter) as of the date of this Agreement, collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth
therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Financing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that solely in
the case of the Fee Letter, true, accurate and complete copies have been
delivered to the Company with only the fee amounts redacted. The Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of SSandC Technologies, Inc. and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization
and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the
availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
counterparty thereto has committed any material breach of any of its covenants
or other obligations set forth in, or is in material default under, the Debt
Commitment Letter, and to the Knowledge of Parent no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a material
breach or material default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, or to the
Knowledge of Parent, of any other party under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy in any material respect any
of the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) make
any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (iv) result in any of
the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied, or (v)
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available. As of
the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and
after giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter) that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or
condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or
that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter will
not be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions to be satisfied
by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied. There are no
conditions precedent or other conditions related to the Financing, or any
contracts, agreements, arrangements or understandings, whether written or
oral, related to the Financing, other than the terms thereof set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this

  



    

11

 



    

Agreement, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or
deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the aggregate
proceeds from the Financing, together with the available cash, available lines
of credit or other sources of immediately available funds that Parent has or
will have prior to the Closing that will not be used for other purposes, are
sufficient in amount to provide Parent with the funds necessary for it to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent to pay the aggregate
amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ and _Section 6.04_ and to pay any
Indebtedness of the Company required to be repaid, redeemed, retired,
cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with
the Merger and any premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith,
including the Company Credit Agreement and any fees related thereto and the
payment of all fees, costs and expenses required to be paid by Parent related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs
and expenses relating to the Financing.

  



  

Section 3.09 _Solvency of the Surviving Corporation Following the Merger_.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Assuming
the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
accuracy of the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ , Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will, immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing,
the payment of the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ and
_Section 6.04_ and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses required to be
paid by Parent or the Company related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including such fees, costs and expenses relating to the
Financing), be Solvent at and after the consummation of the Closing. For the
purposes of this _Section 3.09_ , the term " _Solvent,_ " when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" (determined on a going concern basis) of
the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all
"liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as
of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors; (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date; and (c) such Person will be
able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or lines
of credit, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

  



  

Section 3.10  _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

  



  

(a) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth

respective Affiliates and Representatives, hereby disclaims) and the Company
has not relied on, any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective businesses, operations, properties, assets, liabilities,
conditions (financial or otherwise), prospects or otherwise in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information.

  



  

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_ or in any certificate delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (x) none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of the
Company makes, or has made, any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of any information provided, or made available, to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or Representatives, including

(financial or otherwise), prospects or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives are
not relying on any representation, warranty or other information of the
Company or any Person except for those expressly set forth in _Article IV_ or
(y) no person has been authorized by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any other Person on behalf of the Company to make any representation or
warranty relating to the Company or its business or otherwise in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger, and if made, such representation or
warranty shall not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by such entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.06(b)_ , _Section
4.06(c)_ and _Section 4.06(d)_ , neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary or any other Person has made a representation or warranty
(including as to completeness or accuracy) to Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or any other
Person shall be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective Representatives providing, or making available, to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, or
resulting from the omission of, any financial estimate, financial projection,
financial prediction, financial data, financial information or any memorandum,
presentation or any other materials or information relating to the foregoing,
including any materials or information made available to Parent and/or its
Representatives in connection with presentations by the Company's management
or information made available on any "data sites". Each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its
own independent investigation of the condition (financial or otherwise),
operations and business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied
solely on the results of its own independent investigation
and representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ and has not
relied directly or indirectly on any materials or information made available
to Parent and/or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company.

  



    

13

 



    

(c) Nothing in this _Section 3.10_ shall be deemed to preclude Parent
or Merger Sub from using information made available to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with any presentations by the Company's management or
information made available (or omitted to be made available) to Parent or
Merger Sub for purposes of making any claims of Fraud with respect to any
breach of the representations and warranties contained in Article IV.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has prior to the date hereof made available to

directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that ministerial acts that are not
otherwise prohibited by this _Section 5.04_ (such as answering unsolicited
phone calls, but not proceeding to engage in a substantive conversation) shall
not be deemed to "facilitate" for purposes of, or otherwise constitute a
violation of, this _Section 5.04_ ), (B) furnish non-public information

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives a bona fide Alternative Proposal by any Person or
Group that was not solicited in violation of _Section 5.04(a)_ at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company and its
Representatives may, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, take the
actions set forth in subsections (i) and/or (ii) of this _Section 5.04(b)_ if
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined, in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel), that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or Group prior to
such conclusion to clarify the terms and conditions thereof to determine
whether such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal) and that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (i) furnish non-public
information to and afford access to the business, employees, officers,

  



    

41

 



    

contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to any Person in response to such Alternative Proposal,
pursuant to the prior execution of (and the Company and/or Company
Subsidiaries may enter into) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy
of which shall be provided to Parent); and (ii) enter into and maintain
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to such Alternative
Proposal.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may not take any of the actions set forth in _Section 5.04(b)_ ,
unless (x) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action, and, after taking such
action, the Company shall continue to advise Parent on a reasonably current
basis of the status and material terms of any discussions and negotiations,
and (y) promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
of any Alternative Proposal or any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
third party that the Company has reason to believe may be considering making,
or has made, an Alternative Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Alternative Proposal or request, and subject
to the existing terms of confidentiality obligations of the Company as in
place as of the date of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Proposal (including, in each case, the identity of the Person or
Group making any such Alternative Proposal), and the Company shall as
reasonably promptly as practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of any such
Alternative Proposal, if in writing; or (ii) a summary of the material terms
of any such Alternative Proposal if oral. The Company agrees that it shall
substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided
(pursuant to _Section 5.04(b)_ ) to any other Person or Group in connection
with any such Alternative Proposal that has not previously been provided to
Parent. In addition, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
prompt basis of any material developments regarding any such Alternative
Proposal or request or any material change to the terms or status of any such
Alternative Proposal or request (in each case in a manner that is not unduly
disruptive of the Company's ability to conduct good faith discussions in
accordance with this _Section 5.04_ with the party making such Alternative
Proposal and its Representatives).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to
compliance with _Section 5.04(c)_ , at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company Board may (x) fail to make, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to fail to make, withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or take any
action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation (any of the foregoing being an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
recommending against the Merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any
Alternative Proposal) (A) following receipt of a Superior Proposal or (B) in
response to any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or
condition, or combination thereof, that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Company as of or prior to the date hereof (an "
_Intervening Event_ ") and (y) if the Company has received a Superior
Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 5.04(d_ )), terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a

  



    

42

 



    

definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal
simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement, if, in the case of
clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ , unless:

  



  

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such
action, which notice shall advise Parent of the circumstances giving rise to
the Adverse Recommendation Change, and (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and shall
include a copy of the most current version of the agreement under which such
Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the
Person making the Superior Proposal, or where no such copy is available, a
description of the material items and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
and (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made pursuant
to an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed description of the reasons for
making such Adverse Recommendation Change;

  



  

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
judgment of the Company Board) a Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the
Company attaching a binding agreement reflecting such amendment and a new
period of the longer of (x) 48 hours or (y) one (1) Business Day under this
_Section 5.04(d)_ ), or in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to
make such Adverse Recommendation Change (in the judgment of the Company Board
after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) would no longer be inconsistent with the directors' exercise
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

  



  

(iii) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any,
and after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or that, in the case of an Intervening
Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

  



  

 _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any Adverse
Recommendation Change, until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms (x) in no event may the Company (A) enter into any agreement,
letter of intent, term sheet or other similar instrument

  



    

43

 



    

relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than with respect to any
advancement of the Company Termination Fee), (B) other than as required by
applicable Law, make, facilitate or provide information in connection with any
SEC or other regulatory filings in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Alternative Proposal or (B) seek any third party Consents
in connection with the transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal,
and (y) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to all of its obligations
under this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the Company
Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from making
any legally required (based upon advice of outside counsel) disclosure to
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or an Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , that no such action taken or
statement made that would amount to an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be
permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with this _Section 5.04_.
For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that
describes the Company's receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company that would result in any Person or Group beneficially owning twenty
percent (20%) or more of the outstanding equity interests of the Company or
any successor or parent company thereto or any Company Subsidiary whose
assets constitute 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (B) sale,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way
of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity
interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the

taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions and timing

Article VI 
  
  _Additional Agreements_

  



  

Section 6.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders
Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As reasonably promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (and in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed
with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the Company's stockholders
relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall cooperate with
the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement upon the reasonable
request of the Company and furnish all information concerning Parent and its
Affiliates to the Company as reasonably requested by the Company to be
included in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as reasonably promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement,
and

  



    

45

 



    

Parent will cooperate to provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
(i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement or response (including the proposed final version of the Proxy
Statement or response) and (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

  



  

(b) If prior to the Effective Time any change occurs with respect to
information supplied by Parent or its Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall reasonably promptly notify
the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, and as required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's
stockholders.

  



  

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement,
which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall reasonably promptly notify Parent of such
event, and the Company shall as reasonably promptly as practicable file any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC and, as
required by Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Company's stockholders.

  



  

(d) The Company shall, as reasonably promptly as practicable (but in no
event later than thirty-five (35) days) after the resolution of any comments
of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement (or confirmation of
no comment to, or further review of, the preliminary Proxy Statement by the
SEC or, absent such confirmation or further review by the SEC, the fifteenth
(15th) day after the preliminary Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC)
(the " _Clearance Date_ "), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of (i) seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval; and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange
Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval
of a proposal to the Company's stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote
to approve certain compensation that may become payable to the Company's named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company shall (x) cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Clearance Date; and (y) subject to _Section 5.04(d)_ ,
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Company Recommendation_ ") and shall include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, in each case, except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
5.04(d)_. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms prior thereto, its obligations to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Proposal or by the making of any Adverse

  



    

46

 



    

Recommendation Change by the Company Board, _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the public announcement of an Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery
of notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.04(d)(i)_ occurs
less than 10 Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Company shall be entitled to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting to a date not more than 10 Business Days after the later of such
event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on a date preceding the date on
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably
believes that (i) it will not receive proxies representing the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Common Stock entitled to vote on such matters,
voting together as a single class, at a meeting duly called and held for such
purpose, whether or not a quorum is present, or (ii) it will not have enough
shares of Common Stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or
adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining sufficient proxies
or constituting a quorum. In addition, the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the
Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the information supplied
in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, at the date it is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. No representation is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements or omissions made or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  



  

(f) The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to (i), at the date it
is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading and (ii) comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. No representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements or omissions made or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in
writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  



  

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access,
upon reasonable advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a)
to the extent not publicly available, a

  



    

47

 



    

copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws or commission actions and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request (in each case, in a manner so as to not unduly interfere
in any material respect with the normal business operations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary; provided, that the Company will, in good faith,
consider Parent's requests for access to information described in clauses (a)
and (b) of this _Section 6.02_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure,
to the extent it determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that
such disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms
of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure); (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _provided _ that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (iii) violate any Law ( _provided_
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such access
or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall
not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ to the extent such access or
information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties. All information exchanged pursuant to
this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated
as of November 9, 2017, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms prior to giving effect to the
execution of this Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other party hereto to
take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof, including taking, or causing to be
taken, all actions, and doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to satisfy the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ and consummate and make effective the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any requisite approvals,
consents, authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third
Person, including preparing and filing with a Governmental Entity as
reasonably promptly as practicable all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other documents and to
obtain as reasonably promptly as practicable all Consents necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Governmental Approvals_ "), provided, however, that with respect

  



    

48

 



    

to obtaining FCA Approval, such actions shall include making any capital
contribution or taking any other actions, in each case so long as taking
those actions would not (i) have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole or (ii) involve a shutdown or divestiture of a material portion of
Parent's United Kingdom business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit,
litigation, arbitration, proceeding or investigation is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Regulatory Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that Parent will defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ, the
FCA or any other applicable Governmental Entity under any Regulatory Law.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent applicable and as
required, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, (i) file within fifteen (15) Business Days (unless
otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) an appropriate and
complete filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) make any required
initial notifications to the FCA pursuant to section 178(1) of the FSMA, to
the CBI pursuant to section 39 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 and
the requirements of the CBI and to the CSSF pursuant to Article 18 of the
1993 Law, as soon as practicable and in any event within 20 Business Days
(unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) after the date
hereof, (iii) as reasonably promptly as practicable, make all other required
filings to Governmental Entities required by this Agreement (clauses (i)
through (iii) of this _Section 6.03(b)_ , collectively the "
_Merger Notification Filing_ "), (iv) (A) to furnish as reasonably promptly
as practicable any additional information or documentation that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act (including responding to any "second
request" for additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable), the FSMA, or any other
Regulatory Law, (B) subject to _Section 6.03(a)_ , to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law as
soon as possible and in any event no later than the End Date, and (C) subject
to _Section 6.03(a)_ , take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the FCA Approval, the CBI Approval
and the CSSF Approval as soon as practicable. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto shall promptly supply one another with any information that may
be required in order to make such filings or obtain such consents and
approvals. Information shared among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ shall be subject to such confidentiality
restrictions as may be reasonably requested, including limiting
information to outside counsel only or redacting commercially or
competitively sensitive information.

  



  

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to: (i) promptly notify the others of, and if in
writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication to
such Person from a Governmental Entity (including any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver, the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under any Regulatory

  



    

49

 



    

Law), (ii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the FCA or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, the FCA or
such other Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party and/or
its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences and permit the others to review and discuss in advance (and to
consider in good faith any comments made by the others in relation to) any
proposed written communication to a Governmental Entity (except with respect
to Taxes), (iii) keep the others reasonably informed of any developments,
requests for meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the Merger (including the
nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be
raised under any Regulatory Law with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby) and (iv) permit the other party
and/or its counsel to review in advance, with reasonable time and opportunity
to comment, give reasonable consideration to the other party's comments
thereon, and consult with each other in advance of any proposed submission,
filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be
given by it to the FTC, the DOJ, the FCA or any other Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , in each case, that with respect to any such appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals or such
filings, presentations or submissions, each of Parent and the Company need
not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any applicable Law requires such
party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
information, in which case, the information may be redacted (i) as necessary
to comply with applicable Law and (ii) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the businesses of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be
provided to the other under this _Section 6.03(c)_ as "Outside Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any Merger Notification Filing made pursuant to _Section
6.03(b)_ , each party hereto will promptly inform the other parties of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity
such amendment or supplement.

  



  

(d) Each party hereto shall keep the other parties hereto reasonably
informed, but only to the extent that doing so would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege of the party with
respect thereto regarding any such litigation, action or proceeding, it being
agreed that each party will also cooperate with the other parties to permit
such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
compromise or waive such privilege with respect thereto. Parent shall have the
right to direct all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its
obligations hereunder. It is agreed that Parent shall make all strategic
decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and other proceedings, and
coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that may be made by,
or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be
sought by or from, any Governmental Entity, including determining the
strategy for contesting, litigating or otherwise responding to objections

  



    

50

 



    

to, or proceedings challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case subject to good
faith consultations with the Company reasonably in advance and in
consideration of the Company's views. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall,
nor shall they permit their respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to
acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through
acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), with the
actual intent of increasing the risk of not obtaining, or the actual intent
of increasing the risk of materially impeding or delaying the obtaining of,
any Governmental Approvals with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.03(a)_ or
_Section 6.03(b)_ , pursuant to NASD Rule 1017, the Company shall cause (i)
each Broker-Dealer to file with FINRA, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, a substantially complete application seeking FINRA's approval of the
indirect change of ownership of such Broker-Dealer to be effected as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain such approval, provide Parent and its counsel with an
opportunity to review any related filings prior to their submission and keep
Parent and its counsel reasonably informed of any developments in respect of
such filings, and (ii) each Broker-Dealer that is a member of the NSCC to file
with the NSCC, at least ninety (90) days prior to Closing, a written
notification regarding the indirect change of ownership of such Broker-
Dealer to be effected as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Parent shall provide reasonably promptly any information reasonably necessary
for completion of such applications.

  



  

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall give
prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice
to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure to satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the
conditions specified in  _Article VII_ , and such written notice shall
specify the condition which has failed or will fail to be satisfied; (ii)
any written notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent such consent is material to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) any material written notice
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.03(f)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available under this Agreement to Parent or the Company.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Treatment of Company Awards_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, each vested Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Vested Option_
"), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Closing (but in any event no later than
three (3) Business Days after the Closing), a cash payment equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Common Stock of such Vested Option, multiplied by
(y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Vested Option
(subject to applicable Tax withholding pursuant to _Section 2.02(h)_ ).
Notwithstanding the

  



    

51

 



    

foregoing, to the extent that the exercise price per share of Common Stock of
any Vested Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration (each,
an " _Underwater Option_ "), at the Closing, each such Underwater Option will
be cancelled and extinguished and the holder of such Underwater Option will
not receive any payment therefor.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, each unvested Company Option that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing (each, an " _Unvested Option_ "), shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Common Stock and
shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Stock Option_ ") equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Closing by (y)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to
the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted Stock Option shall have
an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Common Stock subject to such Unvested Option divided by (2) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted Stock Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Unvested Option under
the applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including as to vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, in all cases, the exercise price of, and the number of
shares subject to, each Adjusted Stock Option shall be determined as
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(c) At the Closing, each vested Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Vested RSU_ ") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
canceled at the Closing and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a
cash payment payable as soon as practicable following the Closing (but in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing) equal to the
product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the Vested RSU (subject to any required Tax
withholding pursuant to _Section 2.02(h)_ );  _provided_ , that to the extent
that any such Vested RSU constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be paid in
accordance with the applicable award's terms and at the earliest
time permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the
application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(d) At the Closing, each unvested Company RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing (each, an " _Unvested RSU_ ") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to represent a right with respect to shares of Common Stock and shall
be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ ") equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Closing by
(y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted
Unvested RSU under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including as to vesting.

  



    

52

 



    

(e) At the Closing, each vested Company Performance Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Vested PSU_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled at the Closing and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment payable as soon as practicable following
the Closing (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the
Closing) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be delivered in respect of such
Vested PSU based on actual performance through the Effective Time (subject to
any required Tax withholding pursuant to _Section 2.02(h)_ ); _provided_ ,
that to the extent that any such Vested PSU constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be
paid in accordance with the applicable award's terms and at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the
application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code;

  



  

(f) At the Closing, each unvested Company Performance Stock Unit that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (each, an " _Unvested PSU_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a right with respect to shares of Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
PSU_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares
of Common Stock that would be delivered in respect of such Unvested PSU based
on actual performance through the Effective Time (which shall be equal to
124% of target for Company Performance Stock Units granted in 2016, and 200%
of target for Company Performance Stock Units granted in 2017) by (y) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the
next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted PSU shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Unvested
PSU under the applicable Company Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder, including as to time-vesting requirements (but excluding
any performance vesting criteria).

  



  

(g) Each long-term cash award granted by the Company (each, a "
_Company Cash Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing and that is vested (each, a " _Vested Cash Award_ "), shall be
cancelled at the Closing and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment payable as soon as practicable following the Closing (but in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing) in the
amount set forth in the applicable notice of grant and award agreement;
_provided_ , that to the extent that any such Vested Cash Award constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such
cash payment shall be paid in accordance with the applicable award's terms
and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award that will
not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code. Each unvested Company Cash Award that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing shall remain outstanding and subject to the same terms
and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(h) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take all actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 6.04_ and Parent, the Parent Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, shall take such actions as are
reasonably

  



    

53

 



    

necessary for the assumption by Parent of the Adjusted Stock Options,
Adjusted RSUs and Adjusted PSUs.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time (the " _Indemnity
Period_ "), Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, reimbursement,
advancement of legal fees and expenses and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (it being
agreed that, with respect to the advancement of expenses, after the Closing
such rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable). Parent
shall cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
or governing documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
that are no less favorable to the current or former directors and officers of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries than those set forth in the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions thereafter until the end of the Indemnity Period
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any current or former directors or
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time until the end of the Indemnity
Period, the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who was prior to or is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, at the request of the
Company, of any Joint Venture (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, (i)
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
by this Agreement) or (ii) arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Company Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under applicable Law. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, each Company Indemnified Party will
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation, subject to
any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law, within 20
Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Company
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by a final non-appealable adjudication that such person
is not entitled to indemnification.

  



    

54

 



    

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company or provide substitute policies for the Company and its current
and former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either case, with limits not
less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable in
the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least the same or better
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier for such insurance
policies), except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies an aggregate amount
for such six year period that is more than 300% of the annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, which
amount is set forth in _Section 6.05(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
" _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain
the insurance required by this _Section 6.05(b) _ it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible within such six-year period for an aggregate
amount equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may, at its option (following reasonable
consultation with Parent), purchase a fully prepaid "tail" directors' and
officers' liability insurance for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
such tail insurance to provide limits not less than the existing coverage and
to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the
aggregate cost of any such tail insurance exceed the Maximum
Amount; provided, further, that the Company's procurement of such fully
prepaid "tail" policy in accordance with this sentence shall be deemed to
satisfy in full the Surviving Corporation's obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.05(b)_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable
Law, this Section 6.05 may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Effective Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Company Indemnified Parties or any of their successors, assigns or heirs
without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the
prompt payment of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.05_.

  



    

55

 



    

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.05_.

  



  

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company is a party to
any claim, action, suit or proceeding, as a condition to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.05_ with respect to such claim,
action, suit or proceeding, each Company Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the defense of such action, suit
or other proceeding for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this
_Section 6.05_ , shall furnish or cause to be furnished records, documents,
information and testimony and shall attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection therewith. The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, any of the
Company Indemnified Parties, his or his heirs and his or her representatives.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to entry into a customary
joint defense agreement, the Company shall (i) promptly notify Parent of
litigation relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company and participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company, any Company Subsidiary and/or their respective
directors or officers (the " _Company Parties_ "). None of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company shall compromise,
settle, offer to compromise or settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
such stockholder litigation, in each case unless Parent shall have consented
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

Section 6.07 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time or will be subject to such requirements with
respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made pursuant to Section 5.04(e), or
any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall provide an
opportunity for the other party to review and comment upon any press release
or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior

  



    

56

 



    

to providing such opportunity to review and comment, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this _Section 6.08_ shall limit the
ability of any party hereto to make disclosures or announcements that are
consistent in all material respects with the prior public disclosures
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.09 _Employment and Company Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Parent hereby agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Continuing Employee), it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who continues as of the Effective Time to be employed by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (other than equity
compensation and other long-term incentives, change in control, retention,
transition, stay or similar arrangements) that were provided to such
Continuing Employee under the Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that annual cash incentive bonuses for the fiscal
year in which the Effective Time occurs shall, with respect to the portion of
such year following the Closing Date, be determined by Parent under the terms
of Parent's annual cash incentive plans. In addition, Parent shall honor all
contractual rights to severance in accordance with their terms. 

  



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accruals (with
respect to benefit accruals, solely for the purposes of determining accrual
of vacation, paid time off, and severance benefits), under the employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by each Continuing Employee to the Company prior to the Effective
Time to be credited for such purposes to the same extent as such Continuing
Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Continuing Employees be entitled to service credit to the extent such
service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

  



  

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent coverage
under such Parent Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time; and (ii) for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from
and after the Effective Time, (A) cause all pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements of
such Parent Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents to the extent

  



    

57

 



    

such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or
actively-at-work requirements were waived or satisfied under the
comparable Plan and (B) recognize, or cause to be recognized, any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents under a comparable Plan during the portion of the plan
year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such Parent
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, unless otherwise
directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate
the Company\'s 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "Company Savings Plan") or any
other Plan that is a qualified defined contribution plan and designated by
Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing. In the event the
Company Savings Plan is terminated, Parent shall designate a tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that
is sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_
") that will cover Continuing Employees effective as of the Closing, and
shall count service with the Company as service with Parent for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Parent 401(k) Plan. In connection with the
termination of the Company Savings Plan, Parent shall permit each
participating Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee
from such plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in good faith to take any and all commercially reasonable actions
needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance
under the Company Savings Plan as of the date such plan is terminated to
continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company Savings Plan after the
Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the promissory
notes evidencing such loans from the Company Savings Plan to the Parent 401(k)
Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the
extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect
to such outstanding loans.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 6.09_ are included for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto, and that nothing in this _Section 6.09_ , whether express or
implied, (i) shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in
any other Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company
or any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan.

  



  

(f) For annual bonuses in respect of the calendar year 2018, each
participant in a Plan that is an annual cash incentive plan (each, a "
_Company Incentive Plan_ ") shall be eligible to

  



    

58

 



    

receive a cash bonus (the " _Pre-Closing Bonus_ ") in respect of such year in
an amount equal to the cash bonus amount payable under the applicable Company
Incentive Plan based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance criteria for such fiscal year, with (i) such bonus prorated based
on the number of completed days in the performance year through the
Closing Date and (ii) such level of achievement (1) prorated based on the
number of completed months in the performance year through and including the
end of the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the
Effective Time occurs, (2) determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice (including, without limitation, adjustments, if applicable, to
account for non-recurring items pursuant to the terms of the applicable
Company Incentive Plan). Such Pre-Closing Bonus amounts shall be paid, less
any required withholding Taxes, on or about the date on which the Company
would normally pay annual bonuses (or, if earlier, upon a qualifying
termination of employment as set forth below). In the event of an involuntary
termination of employment of a Continuing Employee (following the Effective
Time and prior to the payment of the bonus amount) under circumstances that
entitle such Continuing Employee to receive severance under the
Company's Employee Severance Plan (as in effect on the date hereof), such
Continuing Employee shall receive his or her Pre-Closing Bonus (but no other
bonus payment for the portion of the year of termination following the Closing
Date unless otherwise determined by Parent in its sole discretion), which
shall be paid, less any required withholding Taxes, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of such Continuing Employee's termination of
employment.

  



  

(g) By March 15, 2018, the Company shall provide Parent with the most
recent annual bonus received and the current annual bonus opportunity with
respect to the employees (other than the Key Employees) listed on the Employee
Census. Five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with updated versions of each of the Equity Award Schedule and
the Employee Census.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with
and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this
Agreement, including to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company, the Subsidiaries,
and their respective Representatives shall not have any responsibility for,
or incur any liability to any Person under, any financing that Parent may
raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any cooperation provided pursuant to _Section 6.11(g)_ and that Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries, and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith, except with respect to any information
prepared or provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives or to the extent such claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and fees, costs or expenses are
determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction

  



    

59

 



    

to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

  



  

(b) Parent shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on terms and conditions,
taken as a whole (including any "flex" provisions), no less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent (as determined by Parent in its sole reasonable
discretion) than the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including executing and delivering all such documents and
instruments as may be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing
its Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

  



  

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter, negotiate and enter into definitive financing
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Agreements_ ") (and
comply with and maintain in effect the Financing Agreements) so that the
Financing Agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable but in any
event no later than the Closing;

  



  

(ii) satisfy, or cause their respective Representatives to satisfy, as
promptly as practicable and on a timely basis all conditions to the
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Financing Agreements
(including by paying any commitment fees or other fees or deposits required
by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements);

  



  

(iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "flex"
provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing Agreements;

  



  

(iv) enforce their rights (including through litigation) under the Debt
Commitment Letter and Financing Agreements in the event of a material breach
(or threatened material breach) by the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, including seeking specific
performance of the parties thereunder; and

  



  

(v) cause the Financing Sources and any other Persons providing
Financing to fund the Financing no later than the Closing;

  



  

it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub may seek to obtain financing
in a private placement of securities pursuant to available exemptions from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in a public offering of
securities pursuant to the Securities Act in lieu of all or a portion of the
Financing (and references to the Financing in this _Section 6.11_ shall be
deemed to include such private placement or public offering, as applicable).

  



  

(c) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy
or other provision under any Debt

  



  

   

60

 



    

Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Company if such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or
waiver would or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
delivered as of the date hereof, (ii) impose additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent to obtain the Financing, (iii) make it
less likely that the Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur) or otherwise
prevent or delay or impair the ability or likelihood of Parent to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall not
agree to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Company, and shall not release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter. Upon any
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of, or waiver of, the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement in accordance with this _Section
6.11(c)_ , Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references
herein to "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Financing Agreements" shall include
and mean such documents as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or
waived in compliance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ , and references to
"Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements as amended, supplemented, modified,
replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ , as applicable.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.11(c)_ above, in the event that all or
any portion of the Financing becomes or could become unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) or from the sources
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements for
any reason or any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements
shall be withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any reason (but
without limiting the obligations of Parent in the penultimate sentence of
_Section 6.11(c)_ and in _Section 6.11(b)(iv))_ , (i) Parent shall promptly so
notify the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event (and in any event no later than the Closing), and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from
the same or alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or
replace any unavailable portion of the Financing), and to obtain a new
financing commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and
related Fee Letter) with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively,
the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), true and complete copies of which
shall be promptly provided to the Company (with only the fee amounts redacted
in any related Fee Letter); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be required to
obtain Alternative Financing on terms and conditions that are materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent than those in the Debt Commitment
Letter that such Alternative Financing and New Debt Commitment Letter would
replace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Alternative Financing or New Debt
Commitment Letter may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies
to the funding of the Financing at the Closing as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms
(including

  



    

61

 



    

any "flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected to make the
likelihood that the Alternative Financing would be funded less likely without
the Company's prior written consent. In the event any Alternative Financing is
obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance with
this _Section 6.11(d)_ , Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company
and references herein to (A) "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to
include and mean the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a
New Debt Commitment Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and
any New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B)
"Financing" shall include and mean the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the preceding clause (A).

  



  

(e) Any material breach of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements by Parent shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this  _Section
6.11_. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company drafts (when available) and
thereafter true and complete and executed copies of the Financing Agreements
promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt written notice of
any default, breach or threatened default or breach (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements of
which Parent or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
becomes aware or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission or
threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission thereof, and
(iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing (or any Alternative Financing), including
by promptly informing the Company of any material dispute or disagreement
between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing
Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount
of the Financing to be funded at the Closing; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant
to clauses (i) or (ii) that would waive the protection of attorney-client or
similar privilege if Parent shall have used reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

  



  

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the
Financing or any Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of
securities contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing, is a
condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing or any Alternative Financing, or the
completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set
forth in _Article VII_.

  



  

(g)  Prior to Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent, as reasonably requested by Parent and at
Parent's sole expense, in its efforts to consummate the financing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Such reasonable best efforts shall
include, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, (i) using reasonable
best efforts to, upon reasonable advance notice, provide direct contact
between prospective lenders, investors and other Financing Sources and the
senior officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business
hours and limited to a reasonable number of times, (ii) providing assistance
in preparation of appropriate and customary information
memoranda, preliminary and final offering

  



    

62

 



    

memoranda or prospectuses, registration statements and other similar
materials customarily required in connection with obtaining such
financing, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to, upon reasonable advance
notice, cause the Company's senior management to cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources for such financing, including
participation in a reasonable number of management presentation sessions, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions, "road shows" and sessions with
rating agencies at reasonable times, (iv) providing assistance in obtaining
any consents of third parties necessary in connection with such financing or
to extinguish existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
provided that the Company shall not be required to deliver any notice of
redemption with respect to the Company Notes prior to Closing unless the
holders thereof have agreed to delivery of a conditional notice, (v) in
obtaining customary payoff letters and lien terminations to the
extent necessary to allow the extinguishing of existing Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the release of any Liens securing such

respective Representatives with respect to responsibility for the use or
misuse of the contents thereof.

shall use reasonable best efforts to keep and maintain at all times prior to
the Closing Date the proceeds of such Financing in a segregated account with

(or similar arrangement) pending the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, then such proceeds may be held in escrow,

(including any and all notice delivery requirements related to the Merger).
In addition, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall:

  



  

(i) on or prior to February 2, 2018, provide notice of a "Control

(ii) as promptly as practicable following the direction of Parent, and
at Parent's sole expense, seek the consent of, and thereafter use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and consummate as promptly as practicable, the
Noteholders and purchasers of the Tranche C Notes (as such term is defined in
the Master Note Purchase Agreement) to the extent required to amend the
Company Notes Agreements to (A) add defeasance and discharge provisions that

necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.12(b)_

Consent Fee shall be conditioned upon the Closing and shall not become
effective or occur until the Closing Date;

  



    

65

 



    

(iii) on the Closing Date, send an irrevocable notice of redemption
(the " _Redemption Notice_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Company
Notes Agreements to all Noteholders to redeem in full the entire principal
amount of all outstanding Company Notes at the respective redemption prices
calculated in accordance with the Company Notes Agreements (the "Company
Notes Redemption Amount"). The Redemption Notice shall set a redemption date
(the "Redemption Date") that is fifteen (15) days from the Closing Date or,
if such day is not a Business Day (or similar term under the Company Notes
Agreements), the next succeeding Business Day. Upon delivery by the Company
of the Redemption Notice to the Noteholders, Parent shall deposit the Company
Notes Redemption Amount with the Company Notes Escrow Agent;

  



  

(iv) take all action and prepare or cause to be prepared all
documentation to effect the foregoing and to otherwise comply with the

Agreements); and

  



  

(v) take all other action with respect to the Company Notes reasonably
requested by Parent.

  



  

(c)  If requested by Parent, at or immediately prior to the Effective

in commercially reasonable form, with respect to any indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to make arrangements for the release of all Liens and other security over the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties and assets securing such
obligations on or immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to delivery
of funds as arranged by Parent).

  



  

Section 6.13 _Public Fund Consents; Other Client Consents_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to
cause to be obtained, (i) the necessary approval of each Public Fund Board
and (ii) the approval of the shareholders of each such Public Fund, in each
case in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Investment
Company Act applicable thereto and any applicable SEC exemptive orders, of a
new Advisory Agreement relating to such Public Fund, with such agreement
becoming effective immediately following the Closing and containing
material terms that are, taken as a whole, substantially similar to (and fee
terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
than) the terms of the applicable existing Advisory Agreement with such Public
Fund. In the event that the approval of the shareholders of a Public Fund (if
such shareholder approval is required under the Investment Company Act and
applicable SEC exemptive orders) of the applicable new Advisory Agreement
described in the foregoing sentence is not obtained prior to the Closing, the
Company may request the Public Fund Board of each such Public Fund to approve,
in conformity with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act, an interim
Advisory Agreement relating to such Public Fund, with such agreement becoming
effective immediately following the Closing and containing material terms
that are, taken as a whole, substantially similar to (and fee terms that are
no less favorable to the

  



    

66

 



    

Company or the Company Subsidiaries than) the terms of the applicable
existing Advisory Agreement with such Public Fund (except for changes thereto
to the extent necessary to comply with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company
Act). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a failure to
obtain the approvals contemplated by this _Section 6.13(a)_ for any Public
Fund prior to the Closing, in and of itself, shall not give rise to any
failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(b)_ to be satisfied.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Client that is not a Public Fund, if any, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Consent (including negative Consent to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and the respective Advisory Agreement) of such Client, solely if and to the
extent required by applicable Law or the respective Advisory Agreement, to the
continuation of such Advisory Agreement following the Closing on terms that
are substantially similar to (and fee terms that are no less favorable to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries than) in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

Section 6.14 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  



  

Section 6.15 _Stock Exchange De-listing; Exchange Act Deregistration_.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable Laws and the rules and policies of the NYSE to
enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from
the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Stock under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the respective
members of their boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and to
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take all such
other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

or failure to act constitutes a material breach or violation of any of its
covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder and such material breach
or violation has been the principal cause of or directly resulted in (1) the

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub has become untrue, in each
case, such that the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.02(b)_ , as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;

termination (it being understood that the Company may enter into such
definitive written agreement simultaneously with such termination of this
Agreement);

warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, or if any representation or
warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case, such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ , as the case
may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section

liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,

_Section 8.03_ and  _Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such

penultimate sentence of _Section 8.03(b_ ), if (x) such termination resulted,
directly or indirectly, from an intentional breach or Fraud (y) an
intentional breach shall cause the Closing not to occur, then, notwithstanding

damages (including Derivative Damages), costs, expenses, liabilities or losses
of any kind, in each case, incurred or suffered by the other party
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") as a result of such breach or Fraud. For
purposes of this Agreement, "intentional breach" means a breach that is
a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with
the Knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or
would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of this
Agreement; it being acknowledged and agreed, without limitation, that any
failure by any party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement after the applicable conditions thereto have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at such time), shall constitute an intentional breach of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, without in any
way limiting the Company's rights under _Section 9.10_ , recoverable damages
of the Company under this Agreement shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain

  



    

71

 



    

lost by the stockholders of the Company (including "lost premium"), taking
into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to
the Company's stockholders under this Agreement and the time value of money,
which in each case shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company
and shall be recoverable by the Company on behalf of its stockholders ("
_Derivative Damages_ ").

  



  

Section 8.03  _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) _Generally_. Except as specifically provided for herein, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions
are consummated.

  



  

(b) _Company Termination Fee_. The Company shall pay to Parent a fee
of $165,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") if:

8.01(d)_ or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ ;
or

  



  

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Proposal
shall have been made by a third party to the Company or publicly announced or
shall have been made directly to the Company's stockholders generally by a
third party; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(i)_ or _8.01(b)(iii)_ ; and (C) within nine months of such
termination, (x) the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate
an Alternative Proposal, (y) the Company recommends an Alternative Proposal
or (z) an Alternative Proposal is consummated, in each of clauses (x), (y) and
(z) whether or not with the Person that announced the Alternative Proposal
described in clause (A) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
this _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_ , the references to 20% in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

  



  

Any Company Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on
the Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this
Agreement (or simultaneously with such termination, in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ ) and (y) in the case of clause (ii)
above, on the date of the earliest of the events set forth in clauses (x),
(y) or (z). The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained

Article, a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, a
Section or an Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained herein are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit
but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such
term herein. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
herein, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used herein shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or"
is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall
not mean simply "if." The definitions contained herein are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. All pronouns and any

may require. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined or referred to herein
means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, except with respect to any agreement in the Company

warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or

amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each
case, as of such date). References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money
of the United States of America. The parties hereto have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring by virtue of the
authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified. When calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is
to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be

  



    

85

 



    

excluded and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the period
shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified,
the words "made available to Parent" or "delivered to Parent" or words of
similar import refer to documents posted to the virtual data room hosted by

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives
its rights under this _Section 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement and, in each case, any
exhibit, schedule or annex thereto, constitute the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement except (a) for the provisions of _Section 6.05_ (which are intended
to be for the benefit of the Company Indemnified Parties referred to therein,
and may be enforced by any such Company Indemnified Parties), (b) for the
right of the Company, on behalf of the holders of the shares of Common Stock
to pursue Derivative Damages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in
the event of Parent's, or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement, which right
is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub (provided that
this clause is not intended, and under no circumstances shall be deemed, to
create any right of the holders of the shares of Common Stock or the holders
of awards under the Company Stock Plans to bring an action against Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) or (c) that the Financing
Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of the
final sentence of _Section 8.05_ , _Section 9.08, Section 9.09(iii), Section
9.11(b)_ , _Section 9.12_ , _Section 9.13_ and this _Section 9.07(c)_ , each
of which shall expressly inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
and relied upon by, the Financing Sources).

  



    

86

 



    

Section 9.08  _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF
CHOICE OR CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FOREGOING, EACH COMPANY RELATED PARTY AND EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER,
ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN
TORT OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY OF THE FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT
TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided _ that the rights,
interests and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub may be assigned (i) to any
of its Affiliates, (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person and (iii) to
the Financing Sources as collateral security, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement
or enlarge or alter such obligations. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the
right of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is agreed that the
parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to below, without proof of
actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  



    

87

 



    

The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason,
nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy for any such breach. In the event any party hereto brings any action,
claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the
Closing, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of
time during which such action, claim, complaint, suit, action or other
proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, claim, complaint, suit,
action or other proceeding.

parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the United States Federal and New York State

  



    

88

York, (ii) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (iv)
agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment of in any other
manner provided by Law.

OTHER PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
