with the Bankruptcy Court to obtain approval of such assumption and
assignment.

 

 

At any time prior to three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the
Auction, Purchasers may, in their sole discretion by written notice to
Sellers, designate any of the Acquired Assets other than Assigned Contracts
and Assumed Leases as additional Excluded Assets, which notice shall set

acknowledge and agree that there shall be no reduction in the Purchase Price
if they elect so to designate any Acquired Assets as Excluded Assets.

by Sellers on the Closing Date) that is conveyed or otherwise disposed of

set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchasers shall execute and
deliver to Sellers the Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to which
Purchasers shall assume and agree to discharge, when due (in accordance with
their respective terms and subject to the respective conditions thereof),

"Assumed Liabilities") and no others:

 (c) all Liabilities related to the Des Plaines Mortgage Loan;

 

 

 (d) amounts incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with

503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code (collectively, "Eligible Administrative

and (ii) Eligible Administrative Claims shall not include the claims of any
suppliers or service providers to the Sellers since the Petition Date that

respective scheduled payment dates.

employees of Sellers and (ii) accrued (to the extent not paid by Sellers) and
unused paid time off ("PTO") to which the Hired Employees are entitled
pursuant to the PTO policies of the Sellers applicable to such
Hired Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "PTO Policies"),
and Purchasers shall permit such Hired Employees to use such PTO in
accordance with Purchasers' PTO policies; provided that during the period
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Sellers shall not modify or
amend the PTO Policies with respect to the Hired Employees;

 

 

 (f) all Cure Costs; and

 

 

 (g) the other liabilities and obligations described on Schedule 1.3(g).

 

 

Section 1.4   Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding any provision in this

obligated to assume or be obliged to discharge any Liability of any Seller,
and Sellers shall be solely and exclusively liable with respect to
all Liabilities of Sellers, other than the Assumed Liabilities (collectively
the "Excluded Liabilities"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded
Liabilities include the following:

 

 

(a) any Liability of Sellers or their directors, officers, stockholders or

limitation, all finder's or broker's fees and expenses and any and all fees

the Business) or (z) the Chapter 11 Cases;

 

 

(c) except as set forth in Section 1.3(d), amounts owed to vendors and
service providers in respect of goods and services arising in the ordinary
course of the Business on or after the Petition Date and existing as of or

priority claim attached to them under Section 503(b)(1) or Section 503(b)(9)
of the Bankruptcy Code;

 

 

(d) except as set forth in Section 1.3(e), any Liability to any Person at

with respect to incidents, events, exposures or circumstances occurring at
any time during the period or periods of any such Person's employment by
Sellers or their predecessors-in-interest, whenever such claims mature or are
asserted, including, without limitation (except as otherwise specifically set
forth herein), all Liabilities arising (i) under any benefit plans, including
any key employee incentive plan approved by the Bankruptcy Court, (ii) under
any employment, wage and hour restriction, equal opportunity, discrimination,

the Closing Date;

 

 

(k) any Liability of Sellers to any Person on account of any Action or
Proceeding, to the extent such Action or Proceeding either exists as of

an Excluded Asset.

 

 

Section 1.5  Assignment of Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases. To the
maximum extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code and subject to the other
provisions of this Section 1.5, Sellers shall assume and transfer and assign
all Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases to Purchasers pursuant to Sections
363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Closing Date or such other date
as specified in the Sale Order or this Agreement, as applicable.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Document to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Assigned Contract or Permit or any right thereunder if an
attempted assignment without the consent of a third party, which consent has
not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order
and the Bankruptcy Code), would constitute a breach or in any way adversely
affect the rights of the Purchasers or Sellers thereunder. If with respect to
any Assigned Contract or Permit (other than any such Assigned Contract or
Permit for which a Third Party Consent is required, such consent is not
obtained or such assignment is not obtainable pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code), then such Assigned Contract or Permit shall not be
transferred hereunder and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the
remaining Assigned Contracts and Permits without any reduction in the Purchase
Price. In the case of Assigned Contracts or Permits (other than any such
Assigned Contract or Permit for which a Third Party Consent is required) (i)
that cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of
third parties, which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing
(after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers
shall, at the Purchasers' sole expense, reasonably cooperate with the
Purchasers in endeavoring to obtain such consent and, if any such consent is
not obtained, Sellers shall, following the Closing, at the Purchasers' sole
expense, cooperate with the Purchasers in all reasonable respects to provide
to the Purchasers the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (ii) that are
otherwise not transferable or assignable (after giving effect to the Sale
Order and the Bankruptcy Code) shall, following the Closing, at the
Purchasers' sole expense, reasonably cooperate with the Purchasers to provide
to the Purchasers the benefits thereof in some other manner (including the
exercise of the rights of Sellers thereunder); provided that nothing in this
Section 1.5 shall (x) require any Seller or any affiliate thereof to make any
significant expenditure or incur any significant obligation on its own or on
behalf of the Purchasers or (y) prohibit any Seller or any affiliate thereof
from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs following the Closing;
provided, further, that nothing in this Section 1.5 shall require
Purchasers to reimburse Sellers for any attorneys' fees and expenses
incurred by Sellers in complying with their obligations under this Section
1.5.

 

 

Section 1.6 Purchase Price. In consideration for the Acquired Assets, the
Purchasers shall, in addition to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities,
(i) pay to the Sellers

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the Closing an amount in cash equal to $70.5 million (the "Cash Purchase
Price") and (ii) deliver to the Sellers a junior subordinated secured note
(the "Junior Secured Note") in the principal amount of not less than $15
million, containing the terms set forth on Exhibit M. The Cash Purchase
Price will be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7 below (as
so adjusted, the "Adjusted Cash Purchase Price"). In addition, the
principal amount of the Junior Secured Note will also be subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.7 below. The "Purchase Price" shall consist
of the sum of the aggregate value of the Assumed Liabilities, the Adjusted
Cash Purchase Price and the principal amount of the Junior Secured Note.

 

 

Section 1.7   Cash Purchase Price and Junior Secured Note Principal Amount
Adjustments. (a) Not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing,
the Purchasers shall have delivered to the Sellers the Pre-funding
Verification. The Cash Purchase Price will then be subject to adjustment
immediately prior to the Closing as follows:

 

 

(i) if the Closing Borrowing Base is less than the Estimated Borrowing Base,
the Cash Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to such
difference, and the Cash Purchase Price, as so adjusted, will be the Adjusted
Cash Purchase Price; provided, however, that if the Adjusted Cash Purchase
Price under this Section 1.7(a)(i) is less than $60.5 million, the principal
amount of the Junior Secured Note shall be increased such that the sum of the
Adjusted Cash Purchase Price and the principal amount of the Junior Secured
Note equals $75.5 million;

 

 

(ii) if the Closing Borrowing Base is greater than the Estimated Borrowing
Base, the Cash Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such
difference, up to an increase of $3 million, and the Cash Purchase Price, as
so adjusted, will be the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price; and

 

 

(iii) if the Closing Borrowing Base is equal to the Estimated Borrowing Base,
the Cash Purchase Price will be the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price.

 

 

(b) The Closing Borrowing Base shall be final and binding on the parties
unless, prior to the Closing, written notice is given by the Sellers to the
Purchasers of its objection, setting forth such objection in reasonable
detail. If such notice of objection is given, the parties shall consult with
each other with respect to the objection. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement after the notice of objection has been given and prior to the
Closing, the dispute shall be submitted, as promptly as practicable, to the
Bankruptcy Court for resolution.

 

 

(c) Within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, the Parties shall agree on
a mechanism to be employed in order to reconcile the actual borrowing base of
the Sellers on the Closing Date to the Closing Borrowing Base. The purpose of
such mechanism is to account for any changes in the borrowing base between
the date as of which the Closing Borrowing Base was prepared and the actual
borrowing base on the Closing Date, with any increases for the account of the
Sellers and any decreases for the account of the Purchasers. The mechanism
may take the form of a post-closing adjustment or other appropriate
arrangements.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1.8   Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes. Within sixty
(60) days after the Closing, Purchasers shall deliver to Sellers
for Sellers' review and approval allocation schedules(s) (the "Allocation
Schedule(s)") allocating the Purchase Price, including the Assumed
Liabilities that are liabilities for federal income Tax purposes, among the
Acquired Assets. The Allocation Schedule(s) shall be reasonable and shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
thereunder and any corresponding provisions of Canadian law. Sellers agree
that, following their approval of the Allocation Schedule(s), such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, Sellers shall sign the Allocation
Schedule(s) and return an executed copy thereof to Purchasers, it being
understood and agreed that on or before the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following their receipt of the Allocation Schedule(s) from Purchasers as
herein provided, Sellers shall either deliver an executed copy thereof to
Purchasers or, in the event that Sellers shall have objections to all or any
portion of the Allocation Schedule(s), Sellers shall deliver to Purchasers a
written objection to such Allocation Schedule(s), which written objection
shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the objection of Sellers
thereto. In the event that Sellers shall deliver a written objection to the
Allocation Schedule(s), Sellers and Purchasers shall thereafter work in good
faith to resolve any and all objections set forth therein, and upon the
resolution of all such objections, Sellers and Purchasers shall execute
and deliver to the other Parties a signed copy of such agreed upon
Allocation Schedule(s). Purchasers and Sellers will each file IRS Form 8594,
any corresponding Canadian Forms and all Tax Returns, in accordance with
the Allocation Schedule(s) that are agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to
the terms of this Section 1.8. Purchasers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, each agrees to provide the other promptly with any other
information required to complete any such forms.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

 

 

 

As an inducement to Purchasers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, each Seller jointly and severally
represents and warrants to Purchasers and agrees as follows:

 

 

Section 3.1  Organization. Each Seller is an entity duly organized validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has full corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate and use the Acquired Assets and to carry on the Business as
now conducted. Each Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Sellers have
heretofore made available to the Purchasers a complete and correct copy of
the organizational documents of each Seller, as currently in effect. Except
as set forth in Schedule 3.1, Sellers do not, directly or indirectly, own, of
record or beneficially, any outstanding voting securities, membership
interests or other equity interests in any Person.

 

 

Section 3.2  Authority of Sellers. Each Seller has full power and
authority to execute, deliver and, subject to the entry of the Sale
Order, perform its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Documents to which such Seller is a party. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and such Ancillary Documents by each Seller
have

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been duly authorized and approved by each Seller's board of directors (or
similar governing body) and, subject to the entry of the Sale Order, do not
require any authorization or consent of any Seller's shareholders or members
that has not been obtained. This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by Sellers and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Purchasers), subject to the entry of the
Sale Order, is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Sellers enforceable
in accordance with its terms, and each of the Ancillary Documents to which
each Seller is a party has been duly authorized by Sellers and upon execution
and delivery by Sellers and subject to the entry of the Sale Order, will be a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Sellers enforceable in accordance with
its terms.

 

 

Section 3.3  Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, or
authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with,
any Governmental Entity is required to be made or obtained by any Seller in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Asset Purchase, except for (a) consents, approvals
or authorizations of, or declarations or filings with, the Bankruptcy Court,
(b) Required Consents and the Third Party Consents set forth on Schedule 3.3
and (c) consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings
or registrations, which, if not obtained, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.4  No Violations. Subject to receipt of the Required Consents
and the Third Party Consents, and after giving effect to the Sale Order,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents by Sellers or the consummation by Sellers of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with or
fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof by
Sellers will conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or
provisions of, or constitute a default or an event of default, or permit the
acceleration of any Liability or obligation, under (1) any charter (or
similar governing instrument) or by-laws (or similar governing document) of
any Seller, (2) any Permits, (3) any Order to which any Seller is bound or
any Acquired Asset is subject, (4) any Legal Requirement affecting Sellers
or the Acquired Assets, or (5) any Contract to which any Seller is a party
or otherwise bound, except in the case of clauses (2), (3), (4), and (5)
immediately above, for such conflicts, breaches, defaults, events of default
or accelerations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.5   Books and Records. The books, records and accounts of the
Sellers maintained with respect to the Business accurately and fairly
reflect, in all material respects and in reasonable detail, the transactions
and the assets and liabilities of the Sellers with respect to the Business.
No Seller has engaged in any transactions with respect to the
Business, maintained any bank account for the Business or used any of the
funds of any Seller in the conduct of the Business except for transactions,
bank accounts and funds which have been and are reflected in the books and

or civil liability under Section 502 of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction"

1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). As of their respective dates, the Seller
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Seller SEC Documents, and none of the Seller SEC Documents,
at the time they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of their
respective dates, the financial statements of Parent included in the Seller
SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto. Such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, during the periods involved (except (i) as may be
otherwise indicated in such financial statements or the notes thereto,
or (ii) in the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may
exclude footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements) and fairly
present in all material respects the financial position of Parent as of the
dates thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

 

 

Section 3.24  Unaudited Financial Statements. The Sellers have delivered
to the Purchasers' Parent's unaudited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the periods ended on November 30, 2008 and February 28, 2009 (the
"Unaudited Financial Statements"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.24,
the Unaudited Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except as indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects (subject to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the consolidated
financial position of Parent as at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended.

 

 

Section 3.25   Eligible Administrative Claims. Sellers estimate that,
based on a good faith assessment of all information available to Sellers as
of the date of this Agreement, the Eligible Administrative Claims will be
approximately $17,691,953 as of the Closing Date (assuming a Closing Date of
July 3, 2009).

 

 

Section 3.26  Cure Costs. Sellers estimate that, based on a good faith
assessment of all information available to Sellers as of the date of this
Agreement, the Cure Costs will be approximately $2,471,935 as of the Closing
Date (assuming a Closing Date of July 3, 2009), subject to adjustment based
on Purchasers' definitive determination and identification of Contracts and
Leases that make up the list of Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases.

SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE III, (I) THE SELLERS

ASSETS OR ANY LIABILITIES OTHER THAN THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR ANY BUSINESS
OTHER THAN THE BUSINESS, AND NONE SHALL BE IMPLIED AT LAW OR IN EQUITY.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS

 

 

The Purchasers represent and warrant to the Seller as follows:

 

 

Section 4.1  Organization. Each Purchaser is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has the requisite power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted.

 

 

Section 4.2  Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each Purchaser has the
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out
its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Purchasers and the consummation by the Purchasers of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate actions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Purchaser and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of the Seller) constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of the Purchasers, enforceable against the Purchasers in
accordance with its terms, and each Ancillary Document to which the
Purchasers are a party has been duly authorized by the Purchasers and upon
execution and delivery by Purchasers will be a valid and binding obligation
of Purchasers enforceable against Purchasers in accordance with its terms
subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
and to general equitable principles.

 

 

Section 4.3  Consents and Approvals. No consent, approval, or
authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be made or obtained by any Purchaser in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Asset Purchase, except for (a) consents, approvals or
authorizations of, or declarations or filings with, the Bankruptcy Court, and
(b) Required Consents set forth on Schedule 4.3.

 

 

Section 4.4  No Violations Subject to receipt of the Required Consents,
and after giving effect to the Sale Order, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to which Purchasers are a party
or the consummation by Purchasers of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with
or fulfillment of the terms, conditions, and provisions hereof and thereof
by Purchasers will conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions
or provisions of, or constitute a default, or an event of default under (1)
either Purchaser's certificate or articles of incorporation (or other
governing documents), (2) any Order to which either Purchaser is a party or
by which it is bound, (3) any Legal Requirement affecting either Purchaser or
(4) any material Contract to which any Purchaser is a party or otherwise
bound.

 

 

Section 4.5  Brokers. Except for William Blair and Company, L.L.C., whose
fees, commissions and expenses are the sole responsibility of Purchasers,
except as otherwise provided herein as part of the Expense Reimbursement
obligation of Sellers, no person is entitled to any brokerage, financial
advisory, finder's or similar fee or commission payable by the Purchasers in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Purchasers.

 

 

Section 4.6  Financing.

 

 

 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Purchasers will have sufficient funds available
to deliver the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price to the Sellers and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
timely satisfaction of the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

 

(b) The Purchasers have advised the Sellers that Purchasers have received (i)
a commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter"), relating to the provision
of a senior credit facility (the "Debt Financing") for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) an equity
commitment letter (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and together with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitments Letters"), pursuant to
which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof the investor named
therein has committed to invest the amount set forth therein (the
"Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing").
The respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have
not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the
Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, each of the Financing Commitment
Letters is in full force and effect. There are no conditions precedent
(including pursuant to any "flex" provisions) related to the Financing, other
than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitment Letters, the
aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by
the Financing Commitment Letters will be sufficient for the Purchasers to pay
the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price and to pay all related fees and
expenses pursuant hereto and the Ancillary Documents. As of the Effective
Date, no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default),
in each case, on the part of Purchasers under the Financing
Commitment Letters or any other party to the Financing Commitment Letters,
and the Purchasers do not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be available to the Purchasers on the Closing Date. The Purchasers have
fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the
Effective Date pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letters.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 4.7  Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
(including the Financing, the payment of the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price,
and the payment of all related fees and expenses), (i) the Purchasers and
their subsidiaries will not have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay
such debts as they mature or become due, (ii) the then present fair saleable
value of the assets of the Purchasers and their subsidiaries will exceed the
amount that will be required to pay their existing debts (including the
probable amount of all contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and matured, (iii) the assets of the Purchasers and their subsidiaries at a
fair valuation will exceed their debts (including the probable amount of all
contingent liabilities) and (iv) the Purchasers will not have unreasonably
small capital to carry on their business as proposed to be conducted
following the Closing Date. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, in either case, with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Purchasers.

30

any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI.

 

 

 (b) Subject to Section 5.3(d), as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in

Purchasers so determine in their sole discretion), Sellers and Purchasers
shall each prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act with the United
States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Department of
Justice ("DOJ"), and request early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act. Each Party shall promptly respond to any requests for additional
information in connection with such filings and shall take all other
reasonable actions to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to

to (i) incur any material liability or obligation of any kind (other
than applicable filing fees), or (ii) agree to any sale, transfer, license,
separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition
of, or to any limitation on, the acquisition, ownership, operation,

payment of the applicable filing fee under the HSR Act, but not Sellers' costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees and other legal fees and
expenses) associated with the preparation of Sellers' portion of any
antitrust filings.

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable consistent with
applicable Legal Requirements to cause the conditions precedent to

the Closing to be satisfied and to cause the Closing to occur, including to
secure any consents and approvals of any Governmental Entity required to be
obtained by them under non-United States antitrust or competition laws, in
order to assign or transfer any Permits to Purchasers, to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to
otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth in Article VI, in each case
as necessary to the extent such consents are not provided for or satisfied by
the Sale Order; provided, however, the Sellers shall not make any agreement
or understanding affecting the Acquired Assets or the Business (excluding the
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities) as a condition of obtaining any such
consents or approvals except with the prior written consent of Purchasers.
Purchasers shall act diligently and reasonably to cooperate with Sellers, to
the extent commercially reasonable, to obtain the consents and approvals
contemplated by this Section 5.3(c); provided, however, Purchasers shall not
be required to waive any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI.

such Governmental Entity in response thereto. In addition, none of the
Parties shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigations or other inquiry with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such
Party consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted
by any such Governmental Entity, given the other Parties the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat, in each case to the maximum extent
practicable. Subject to any restrictions under applicable laws, rules or
regulations, each Party shall furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and the Governmental Entity or members of it
staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications which are subject
to pre-existing confidentiality agreements or to the attorney-client
privilege or work product doctrine) or any such filing, notification or
request for approval. Each Party shall also furnish the other Party with such
necessary information and assistance as such other Party and its Affiliates
may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registration or submission of information to the Governmental Entity
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
and any such filing, notification or request for approval. Sellers and
Purchasers shall prosecute all required requests for approval with all
necessary diligence and otherwise use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the grant thereof by an Order as soon
as possible.

 

 

 (e) Sellers shall promptly notify Purchasers, and Purchasers shall promptly
notify Sellers, of any event, condition or circumstance of which any Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, becomes aware after the Effective Date and prior
to the Closing Date that would constitute a violation or breach of this
Agreement (or a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement). During the period prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will
promptly advise Purchasers in writing of any written notice, or to Sellers'
Knowledge other communication, from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
It is acknowledged and understood that no notice given pursuant to

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes
of determining satisfaction of the conditions contained herein.

 

 

Section 5.4  Confidentiality. Subject to the requirements of the Bankruptcy
Code as may be imposed by the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise required by
applicable law, from and after the Closing: (a) Sellers shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, hold in confidence all confidential and proprietary

proposed plans, developments, concepts, designs and pricing information),
whether stored in writing, electronically or graphics, or learned orally,
visually, or through inspection, of Sellers relating to the Business or the
Acquired Assets; (b) in the event the Sellers or an Affiliate thereof shall
be legally compelled to disclose any such information, Sellers shall provide
Purchasers with prompt written notice of such requirements so that
Purchasers may seek a protective order or other remedy; and (c) in the event
that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall furnish only such information as is legally required to be
provided.

 

 

Section 5.5  Further Assurances. In addition to the provisions of this
Agreement, from time to time after the Closing Date, the Sellers and the
Purchasers shall use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver such
other instruments of conveyance, transfer or assumption, as the case may be,
and take such other action as may be reasonably requested to implement more
effectively the conveyance and transfer of the Acquired Assets to the
Purchasers and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchasers;
provided that nothing in this Section 5.5 shall (x) require any Sellers or
any affiliate thereof to make any significant expenditure or incur any
significant obligation on its own or on behalf of the Purchasers not
otherwise contemplated herein or (y) prohibit any Seller or any affiliate
thereof from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs following the
Closing.

 

 

Section 5.6  Cure Costs. On or prior to the Closing, the Purchasers shall
pay, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order, any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and certain other
interested parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and, if necessary,

Purchasers agree that they will take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining the Sale Order,
including furnishing affidavits or other non-confidential documents or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court to demonstrate adequate
assurance of future performance under the Assigned Contracts and Assumed

Acquired Assets; (iv) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; (v) Sellers'
labor unions; and (vi) taxing authorities having jurisdiction over Sellers or

Procedures Order by the Bankruptcy Court Sellers shall serve notice of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement upon all parties identified as
creditors set forth on Schedules D through H of each of the Sellers'
Schedules of Statements and Liabilities filed with the Bankruptcy Court.

 

 

 (d) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, Sellers shall promptly
notify Purchasers of such appeal or stay request and shall promptly
provide to Purchasers a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of
stay. Sellers shall also provide Purchasers with written notice of any motion
or application filed in connection with any appeal from either of such
orders. If an appeal or a stay of pending appeal is taken with respect to
the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, Sellers shall use their best
efforts to cause the timely opposing and dismissing of such appeal or stay
pending appeal and to cause such order to become a Final Order.

 

 

 (e) From and after the Effective Date, and to the extent Purchasers are the
Successful Bidder at the Auction, Sellers shall not take any action that is
intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which failure
to act would result in, the reversal,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voiding, modification or staying of the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale
Order. In addition, provided that Purchasers are the Successful Bidder at the
Auction, following completion of the Auction contemplated hereby, Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their respective representatives and affiliates
not to, initiate contact with, solicit or encourage submission of any
inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person (other than Purchasers
and their authorized agents and Representatives) in connection with any sale
or other disposition of the Acquired Assets, except as may be approved by the
Bankruptcy Court as part of the Bidding Procedures. In addition, Sellers
shall not after completion of the Auction contemplated herein respond to any
inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part of the Acquired Assets or
perform any other acts related thereto, including supplying information
relating to the Business and the assets of Sellers to prospective buyers.

 

 

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall provide
Purchaser at least two (2) days in advance of filing with the
Bankruptcy Court, a draft of any motions, orders, notices, or other pleadings
that Sellers propose to file with the Bankruptcy Court seeking approval of
this Agreement, including approval of the Bidding Procedures, the Break-Up
Fee and Reimbursement and assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts
and Assumed Leases. Sellers shall cooperate with Purchasers and consider in
good faith the views and any changes or revisions requested by Purchasers
with respect to all such filings. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
affect or alter the requirement that the form and substance of the Bidding
Procedures Order and the Sale Order shall be in form and substance acceptable
to Purchasers in their sole discretion.

 

 

Section 5.8  Canadian Process. The Parties covenant to agree, within seven
(7) days of the Effective Date, to a mutually acceptable process to convey
that portion of the Acquired Assets owned by the Canadian Sub
(the "Canadian Acquired Assets") to the Purchasers, conditioned upon
Purchasers being the successful bidders in the Canadian Sale Process. The
Parties agree that any such process will be structured by the Canadian Sub
(in a manner acceptable to the Purchasers), and would be designed to result
in a Canadian Court approved sale to the Purchasers (subject to the
conditions above) of the Canadian Acquired Assets free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances (the "Canadian Sale
Process"). Within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, this Agreement
shall be amended by the Parties, on mutually acceptable terms, in a manner
consistent with the foregoing and in order to permit the Agreement (or any
derivative agreement thereof) to stand as a stalking horse bid in the
Canadian Sale Process.

 

 

Section 5.9  Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement. Subject to (i) the
entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding Procedures Order approving the
payment of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement to the Purchasers,
and (ii) delivery by Purchasers to Sellers all of the Financing Commitment
Letters and additional commitment letters relating to the provision of the
Debt Financing that provide funding to the Purchasers in an amount equal to,
in the aggregate, at least the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers, Sellers agree to
pay Purchasers the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement in
accordance with Section 7.2 in the event this Agreement is terminated under
the circumstances described therein.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.10   Bidding Procedures. The bidding procedures to be employed
with respect to this Agreement shall be those reflected in the Bidding
Procedures Order. Purchasers agree and acknowledge that Sellers and
their representatives and affiliates are and may continue soliciting
inquiries, proposals or offers for the Acquired Assets in connection with any
Alternative Transaction pursuant to the terms of the Bidding
Procedures Order.

 

 

Section 5.11   Insurance. Until the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain (including necessary renewals thereof)
insurance policies against risk and liabilities to the extent and in the
manner and at the levels maintained by Sellers as of the Effective Date with
respect to the Business and the Acquired Assets.

 

 

Section 5.12   Letters of Credit. On the Closing Date, the Purchasers
shall, with respect to each letter of credit described on Schedule 5.12 (the
"Existing Letters of Credit"), use commercially reasonable efforts to either
(a) cause replacement letters of credit to be issued to the beneficiaries of
such Existing Letter of Credit, obtain the originals of such Existing Letter
of Credit from the beneficiary thereof to return to Wachovia Capital Finance
Corporation (Central) ("Wachovia") and deliver to Wachovia each such
Existing Letter of Credit or (b) provide arrangements satisfactory to the
entity that issued such Existing Letter of Credit in the form of cash
collateral, back-up letters of credit or other credit support, in each case
in a manner consented to by Wachovia such that Wachovia will deliver to the
Sellers on the Closing Date an unconditional release of all of the
obligations of the Sellers with respect to such Existing Letter of Credit.

 

 

Section 5.13  Employee/Labor Matters.

 

 

 (a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Purchasers
shall provide Schedule 5.13(a) to Sellers, setting forth on such schedule
the names of the employees then employed by the Sellers in connection with
the Acquired Assets as of the Effective Date that Purchasers intend to
hire (collectively, the "Hired Employees") effective as of the day following
the Closing Date. Sellers agree that all Hired Employees shall be terminated
from employment with Sellers on or before the Closing Date and the rights
and benefits of such Hired Employees under the Benefit Plans shall be
determined and calculated based on such termination.

 

 

 (b) None of the Benefit Plans shall be transferred to or assumed by
Purchasers or any of Purchasers' Affiliates, nor shall any Benefit
Plans follow the sale of the Acquired Assets to Purchasers. None of the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates shall assume any liability or
responsibility under any of the Benefit Plans.

 

 

 (c) Sellers agree to retain responsibility to make arrangements for the
opportunity to continue Sellers' health coverage as required by ERISA and
COBRA for all Hired Employees who are terminated from employment with Sellers
prior to Closing, and to provide all applicable notices to such
individuals. Sellers shall take such other actions, if any, as may be
necessary to notify such Hired Employees of the rights to which they are
entitled under Sellers' Benefit Plans upon termination of employment with
Sellers, including the obligation to provide any applicable certificates of
coverage under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36

Employee as Purchasers may reasonably require in connection with
their employment or engagement of such individuals, including initial
employment dates, termination dates, reemployment dates, hours of service,

applicable law.

 

 

 (e) On or before the Closing Date, but effective as of the day following
the Closing Date, Purchasers shall offer employment to all Hired Employees
who are subject to current or expired Collective Bargaining Agreements
governing the Hired Employees at the (i) Des Plaines, IL and (ii) Rochester,
NY facilities, and who have been working on a full-time basis since July 1,
2008 (collectively, the "Hired Represented Employees"). If Purchasers assume
the Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to the Hired Represented
Employees, such offer of employment shall be upon the terms and conditions
set forth in such Collective Bargaining Agreements. If Purchasers do not
assume the Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to the Hired
Represented Employees, such offer of employment shall include (i) wages
similar to those the Hired Represented Employees were paid by Sellers as of
January 1, 2009; (ii) the same health and welfare benefit package that
Purchasers offer to Non-Represented Hired Employees; and other terms of
employment that Purchasers shall establish. If Purchasers do not assume the
Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to the Hired Representative
Employees, Purchasers shall have no responsibility for any obligations or
liabilities arising under the Collective Bargaining Agreements or any
other Contract affecting such Hired Represented Employees.

 

 

 (f) All Hired Employees who are not Hired Represented Employees shall be
referred to herein as "Non-Represented Hired Employees." On or before the
Closing Date, but effective as of the day following the Closing Date,
Purchasers shall offer employment to the Non-Represented Hired Employees on
such terms and conditions as the Purchasers and the Non-Represented Hired
Employees shall agree to prior to the Closing Date. Purchasers shall have no
other liabilities with respect to the Non-Represented Hired Employees except
as specifically set forth herein.

 

 

 (g) All periods of service with the Sellers by the Hired Employees shall be
recognized by the Purchasers solely for purposes of eligibility
to participate in Purchasers' health, welfare and qualified retirement
benefit plans that are offered to the Hired Employees to the extent permitted
by any carriers insuring such plans; provided, however, that such recognition
of service shall not result in duplication of benefits for any Hired
Employee. Purchasers shall also recognize, or cause Purchasers' benefit plans
to recognize, all out of pocket expenses and deductibles paid or incurred by
the Hired Employees prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
the Purchasers' health benefit plans to the extent permitted by any carriers
insuring such plans.

 

 

 (h) No Seller shall (i) offer employment for any period on or after the
Closing Date to any employee or agent of the Business regarding whom
Purchasers make offers of employment in accordance with the terms set forth
herein or (ii) otherwise attempt to persuade any such employee or agent to
terminate his or her relationship with the Business.

Section 5.14   Access to Records After Closing.

 

 

 (a) Except as provided in Section 8.4(c), for a period of seven (7) years
after the Closing Date, Sellers and their Representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Business transferred
to Purchasers hereunder to the extent that such access may reasonably
be required by Sellers in connection with matters relating to or affected by
the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date or are otherwise
required by Sellers in connection with the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases
and the wind-down of their respective estates. Such access shall be afforded

business hours. Sellers shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses
incurred by them pursuant to the preceding sentences of
this Section 5.14(a).

 

 

 (b) Except as provided in Section 8.4(c), for a period of three (3) years
after Closing Date, Purchasers and its Representatives shall have reasonable
access to all of the books and records of the Business that Sellers may retain
after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Sellers upon receipt
of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Purchasers
shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by them
pursuant to this Section 5.14(b). If Sellers shall desire to dispose of any
of such books and records prior to the expiration of such three-year
period, Sellers shall, prior to such disposition, give Purchasers a
reasonable opportunity, at Purchasers' expense, to segregate and remove such
books and records as Purchasers may select.

 

 

Section 5.15  Collection of Receivables; Cash Forwarding.

 

 

 (a) If, after the Closing Date, Sellers shall receive payment from any
account debtor with respect to any Accounts Receivable included in
the Acquired Assets, including through the deposit and/or clearance of
any post-dated checks received by any Seller at any time, whether before, on
or after the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly thereafter deliver such
funds and assets to Purchasers and take all steps necessary to vest title to
such funds and/or assets in Purchasers. Sellers shall provide Purchasers a
monthly statement on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month setting forth
in reasonable detail the Accounts Receivable so received by Sellers. Each
Seller hereby designates Purchasers and their respective officers as such
Seller's true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution,
to execute and endorse for the benefit of the Purchasers all checks, notes or
other documents received by such Seller in payment of or in substitution or
exchange for any of the Acquired Assets. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that (i) the power of attorney set forth in the preceding sentences in
favor of Purchasers is coupled with an interest, and further agrees to
execute and deliver to Purchasers from time to time any documents or other
instruments reasonably requested by Purchasers to evidence such power
of attorney and (ii) any such Accounts Receivable shall be deemed to be held
in trust for Purchasers and shall not be property of the Sellers' estates.

Purchasers shall transfer such amounts by wire transfer in immediate
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Sellers as soon
as practicable (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after
such funds are available for transfer under the policies and procedures of

Section 5.16   Observance of Policies Regarding Personally Identifiable
Information. With respect to the Acquired Assets only, Purchasers shall

Bankruptcy Code.

 

 

Section 5.17   Corporate Name Change. Sellers shall, after the Closing,
refrain from using and displaying any of the names, Trademarks and service
marks that are included in the Acquired Assets, and in accordance with such
requirement, by no later than thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing,
Sellers shall legally change their corporate names (to the extent such names
include such Trademarks or a confusingly similar Trademark), to names that
are not confusingly similar to such Trademarks, and file notices of such name
changes with the Bankruptcy Court. Further, under no circumstance shall
Sellers after the Closing use the Trademarks or Domain Names included in the
Acquired Assets or other indicia confusingly similar to the Trademarks or the
Domain Names included in the Acquired Assets, Copyrights included in the
Acquired Assets, or any work substantially similar to the Copyrights included
in the Acquired Assets, as a source identifier in connection with any Seller
product, service or corporate, business or domain name. Nothing in this
Section 5.17 shall preclude any uses of Trademarks or Copyrights included in
the Acquired Assets by Sellers that are not prohibited by Legal
Requirements, including uses that would not cause confusion, mistake or
deception as to the origin of a good or services, and references to
Trademarks or Copyrights in historical, tax and similar records.

 

 

Section 5.18   Financing.

 

 

 (a) (i) The Purchasers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitment Letters (or
on revised terms no less favorable in any material respect to the Purchasers
(as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasers)) which terms do
not contain any provisions which would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment
Letters, (B) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the
Purchasers obtaining the Debt Financing that are within their control, (C)

(including any servicer or sub-servicer), to the assignment of the Des
Plaines Mortgage Loan and Des Plaines Mortgage Loan Documents to Purchasers
or their designees, including any amendments to such documents reasonably
requested by Purchasers, and (ii) any lender, lienholder, or other third
party that possesses any lien, mortgage, deed of trust, security interest, or
other similar encumbrance on or in any of the Tangible Personal Property.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any and all of the fees,
costs, and expenses of securing a consent set forth in the

agree that Purchasers shall have the right to remove any and all Tangible
Personal Property (the "Tangible Personal Property Removal"), at their sole

Real Property or any property subject to a Lease other than the Acquired
Leased Real Property (the "Excluded Real Property") from and after the
Closing Date to the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the
"Tangible Personal Property Removal Period"). During the Tangible Property
Removal Period, any sale, assignment or sublease of Excluded Real Property
by the Sellers will be subject to Purchasers' rights under this Section 5.20.
Upon the expiration of the Tangible Personal Property Removal Period, any and
all Tangible Personal Property that has not been removed by Purchasers in

Property other than as set forth in this Agreement and shall not be
responsible for any change in such condition that occurs as a result of the
Tangible Personal Property Removal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b) Sellers hereby grant Purchasers an irrevocable license for the Tangible
Personal Property Removal Period to enter onto any Excluded Real Property for

that Purchasers (i) provide at least one (1) Business Day's prior notice to
Sellers of the desire to enter onto an Excluded Real Property for the
purposes set forth in this section, (ii) undertake any removal during normal
business hours, (iii) comply with any and all terms of any Lease, if

movers, or other third-parties to assist them in the Tangible
Personal Property Removal, such third-parties possess standard amounts of
general liability insurance insuring against liability for injury to or death
of a person or persons, and damage to or destruction of tangible
property, occasioned by or arising out of or in connection with the use of,
or entry on, the Excluded Real Property, and (vi) use commercially reasonable
efforts to not materially interfere with the use or occupation of the
applicable Excluded Real Property by Sellers. Sellers shall have the right to
have a representative present at all times during any entry onto an Excluded
Real Property by Purchasers. Under no circumstances shall Purchasers use the
Excluded Real Property in a manner that will cause the Excluded Real Property
to be in violation of any codes, covenants, laws or restrictions governing
the Excluded Real Property.

for and receiving refunds from the Wool Trust Fund administered by United
States Customs and Border Protection with respect to manufacturing performed
in calendar years 2009 and thereafter, Parent assigns to a Person to be
designated by the Purchasers (the "Wool Refund Designee") the status as
successor-in-interest as a manufacturer of men's and boys' suits, sports
coats, and trousers pursuant to Section 4002(c)(4) of the Miscellaneous Trade
and Technical Corrections Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-429). Parent hereby assigns
to the Wool Refund Designee the right to apply and receive payments under the
Wool Trust Fund program described herein and acknowledges the assignment to
the Wool Refund Designee of the right to manufacture under various trade
names previously used by Parent as part of the sale of assets. As the

Parties under this Agreement shall terminate without any liability of any

any party from liability for fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination or abandonment of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The provisions of Sections 5.4¸ 5.9, 7.2 and Article VIII
shall expressly survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(a), from and after entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order (and subject to delivery by Purchasers to Sellers of all
Financing Commitment Letters related to the Financing), (i) if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Sections 7.1(c), 7.1(d) or 7.1(f), then Sellers
shall pay to Purchasers the Expense Reimbursement in full and complete
satisfaction of all of Sellers' obligations hereunder; or (ii) if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 7.1(h) and 7.1(i), then
Sellers shall pay to Purchasers the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement in full and complete satisfaction of all Sellers' obligations
hereunder. The payments of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
shall be made without further order of the Bankruptcy Court by wire transfer
of immediately available funds promptly (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following the occurrence of one of the termination events set
forth in this paragraph, provided, that in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Break-Up Fee and Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid upon consummation of the first transaction that
constitutes an Alternative Transaction. Each of the Break-Up Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement shall be paid as an administrative expense of the
Sellers with priority over any and all other administrative expenses of the
kind specified in Section 503(b) or 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and payable
out of the Sellers' cash or other collateral securing the Sellers'
obligations to its senior secured lenders (prior to any recovery by such
lenders) pursuant to Section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be free
and clear of all Encumbrances and other interests, and shall be deemed an
authorized and approved expenditure in the DIP Budget. The Sellers hereby
acknowledge that each of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement shall
survive termination of this Agreement, and the Sellers shall obtain the
senior secured lenders' written consent to the priority and payment of such
Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement as provided herein on or prior to
the date of entry of the Bidding Procedures Order. Except as set forth in the
proviso in Section 7.2(a), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Purchasers' right to receive payment of the Break-Up Fee and
the Expense Reimbursement from Sellers as herein provided shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to the Purchasers against Sellers or any of
their respective former, current or future equity holders, directors,
officers, affiliates or agents with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Sections 7.1 (c), 7.1(d), 7.1(f), 7.1(h) or 7.1(i) and
upon payment of the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement in the
circumstances described herein, none of Sellers nor any of their respective
former, current or future equity holders, directors, officers, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g)
hereof (if at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or
circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by or
arising out of a breach of Purchasers' agreements, covenants,
representations or warranties contained herein or in the Bidding Procedures
Order or the Sale Order) that would reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.3 not to be satisfied on or prior
to July 22, 2009) or Section 7.1(j), then the Purchasers shall pay to the
Sellers an amount in cash equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00)
(the "Purchaser Termination Fee") as promptly as possible (but in any event
within two Business Days) following such termination by Sellers as liquidated
and agreed damages in respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and as full consideration for the Sellers'

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efforts and expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers' right to receive payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee
from the Purchasers pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Sellers against Purchasers and any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of such
transactions to be consummated, under any theory or for any reason, and upon
payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, none of Purchasers or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereto. For purposes of this
Section 7.2(c) only, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
"Purchasers" shall be deemed to include SKNL Parent.

 

 

 (d) In no event shall Purchasers be liable to Sellers or any of their
Affiliates, nor shall Sellers or their Affiliates be liable to Purchasers or
any of their Affiliates, for special, punitive, incidental, indirect,
exemplary or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement, notwithstanding the fault, strict
liability, breach of contract or negligence, whether sole, joint or
concurrent, active or passive, of the beneficiary of this limitation or
whether asserted in contract, in warranty, in tort, by statute or otherwise.
Any such claim, right or cause of action for any damages that are special,
punitive, incidental, indirect, exemplary, or consequential damages is hereby
fully waived, released and forever discharged.

 

 

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

 

Section 8.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Agreements. No
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive beyond the Closing Date.

 

 

Section 8.2  Confidentiality. Each Party agrees that it will treat in
confidence all documents, materials and other information that it shall have
obtained regarding the other Party during the course of the negotiations
leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether
obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the investigation
provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related
documents. Such documents, materials and information shall not be disclosed
or communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of Purchasers,
to its counsel, accountants, financial advisors and potential lenders, and in
the case of Sellers, to their counsel, accountants and financial advisors).
No Party shall use any confidential information referred to in the second
immediately preceding sentence in any manner whatsoever except solely for the
purpose of evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets
and the enforcement of its rights hereunder and under the Ancillary
Documents; provided, however, that after the Closing, Purchasers may use or
disclose any confidential information that is otherwise reasonably related

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Business of the Acquired Assets for purposes of the conduct of the
Business. The obligation of each Party to treat such documents, materials and
other information in confidence shall not apply to any information that (i)
is or becomes available to such Party from a source other than such Party,
(ii) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by such Party or its agents, (iii) is required to be disclosed
under applicable law or judicial process, including the Chapter 11 Cases, but
only to the extent it must be disclosed, or (iv) such Party reasonably deems
necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or approvals contemplated
hereby.

 

 

Section 8.3  Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable
law or by obligations of Seller or the Purchaser or their respective
affiliates pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, Seller and the Purchaser shall consult with each other before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or
the activities and operations of the other and shall not issue any such
release or make any such statement without the prior written consent of the
other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

Section 8.4  Taxes; Assumed Lease Payments; Security Deposits; Title Costs.

 

 

 (a) Except for Taxes that constitute Assumed Liabilities or as provided in
this Section 8.4, Sellers shall be liable for and shall pay, and pursuant to
Section 8.4(d) shall reimburse Purchasers for, all Taxes (whether assessed
or unassessed) applicable to the Business and the Acquired Assets, in each
case attributable to periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Without limiting the obligations of Purchasers contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, including in respect of the Assumed Liabilities,
Purchasers shall be liable for and shall pay, and pursuant to Section 8.4(d)
shall reimburse the applicable Seller for, all Taxes (whether assessed or
unassessed) applicable to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities, in each case attributable to periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this paragraph
(a), any period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date shall be
treated as two partial periods, one ending on the Closing Date and the other
beginning on the day after the Closing Date. Taxes imposed on a period basis
(such as property Taxes) shall be allocated on a daily basis.

 

 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any sales Tax, use
Tax, real property transfer or gains Tax, documentary stamp Tax, excise Tax,
intangible Tax or similar Tax attributable to the sale or transfer of the
Acquired Assets and not exempted under the Sale Order ("Transfer Taxes")
shall be borne by Purchasers. Sellers and Purchasers shall use reasonable
efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt or minimize the sale and
transfer of the Acquired Assets from any such Transfer Taxes. Purchasers
shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns or other documents
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that in the event
any such Tax Return requires execution by Sellers, Purchasers shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a copy of such Tax Return at least ten days before the
due date thereof, and, provided that such Tax Return is consistent with
allocations approved by Sellers pursuant to Section 1.8 heretofore,
Sellers shall promptly execute such Tax Return and deliver it to Purchasers,
which shall cause it to be filed in a timely manner.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c) The Sellers and the Purchasers shall promptly provide each other with
any reasonably requested information for purposes of determining any Tax
liability in respect of any Acquired Asset, and shall otherwise make
available to each other all information, records, or documents relating to
liabilities for Taxes in respect of the Acquired Assets. The Sellers and the
Purchasers shall preserve all such information, records and documents until
the expiration of any statute of limitations or extensions thereof. Sellers
shall promptly provide copies of all IRS Forms W-2, W-4 and 1099 and any
equivalent Canadian forms with respect to employees and
independent contractors.

 

 

 (d) Sellers or Purchasers, as the case may be, shall promptly and in any
event within 30 days of receipt of notice thereof, provide reimbursement
for any Tax paid by one Party all or a portion of which is the responsibility
of the other Party in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.4. Within a
reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the Party paying such
Tax shall give notice to the other Party of the Tax payable and each Party's
respective liability therefor, although failure to do so will not relieve the
other Party from its liability hereunder.

 

 

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of
an examination or audit of any position taken on a Tax Return, Purchasers
shall have the right to control any and all such examinations or audits,
including appeals, where Purchasers would, pursuant to this Agreement,
be liable for additional Taxes that could be imposed as a result of
such proceeding. Sellers shall be kept informed of the status of any such
proceeding, and Purchasers shall not agree to any settlement that would
require payment from Sellers without the written consent of Sellers (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Sellers shall
cooperate fully in all matters relating to any such examination or audit or
other Tax proceeding (including according access to all records pertaining
thereto), and will execute and file any and all consents, powers of attorney
and other documents as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection therewith.

 

 

 (f) Purchasers and Sellers hereby waive compliance with all "bulk sales,"
"bulk transfer" and similar laws that may be applicable with respect to the
sale and transfer of any or all of the Acquired Assets to Purchasers.

 

 

 (g) Sellers and Purchasers shall, to the extent possible, (i) treat
Purchasers as a "successor employer" and Sellers as a "predecessor," within
the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect
to employees of Sellers to be employed by the Purchasers for purposes of
Taxes imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the
United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act and (ii) cooperate with
each other to avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to
each such employee for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

 

 

 (h) All monetary obligations of Sellers under the Assumed Leases, including
the payment of any rent, tax charges, escalation, additional rent, utilities,
common area maintenance charges, and any other amounts required to be paid by
Sellers under the Assumed Leases (based upon the most recent ascertainable
bills if current bills and/or information are not available) (the
"Assumed Lease Payments") (i) which relate to periods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior to the Closing Date shall be the responsibility of Sellers and (ii)
which relate to the periods from and after the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of Purchasers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the parties hereto shall prorate the Assumed Lease Payments at the
Closing and the Adjusted Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted to
provide Sellers with a credit for all monetary obligations of Sellers under
the Assumed Leases that have been paid in advance and which relate to periods
from and after the Closing Date and to provide Purchasers a credit for all
monetary obligations under the Assumed Leases that have not been paid and
which relate to periods prior to the Closing Date. All such prorations in
connection with the Assumed Leases as of the Closing Date shall be final. At
Closing, Sellers shall have the right to net any amounts owed by Sellers with
respect to the foregoing against the Adjusted Purchase Price.

 

 

 (i) On the Closing Date and with respect to each Assumed Lease, Purchasers
shall (i) deliver a security deposit, in a form and on the terms that are
permitted under such Assumed Lease or otherwise acceptable to the
landlord thereto, to the landlord under such Assumed Lease as a replacement
for any security deposit that has previously been provided by Sellers in
connection with such Assumed Lease and (ii) provide evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers that such obligation has been satisfied; provided,
however, that in the event that Sellers have previously provided the landlord
under an Assumed Lease with a security deposit in the form of a cash payment,
then in lieu of Purchasers providing a replacement security deposit, Sellers
shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, receive a credit for
the full amount of such security deposit as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

 

 

 (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchasers shall
be responsible for any and all costs, fees, and expenses arising out of, or
related to, the issuance of the Title Commitments, including, but not limited
to, the escrow fees, closing fees, title examinations and searches,
title insurance premiums, endorsements costs and any recording fees relating
to the recordation of the Deeds.

 

 

Section 8.5  Notices. All notices, claims, demands, and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon
(a) confirmation of receipt of a facsimile transmission, (b) confirmed
delivery by a standard overnight carrier or when delivered by hand, or (c)
the expiration of five (5) Business Days after the day when mailed
by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested),
