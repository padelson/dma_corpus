v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October
13, 2015, is made by and among Jarden Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), VHC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), Visant Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ") and the Stockholder Representatives (as
defined herein), solely in their capacity as agents and attorneys-in-fact for
the Consideration Recipients (as defined herein).

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "
_Merger_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders and (ii) declared the advisability
of this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the mutual covenants and the respective
representations and warranties contained herein, the parties hereby agree as
follows:



   ARTICLE I. | _THE MERGER._ 
---|--- 

1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with this Agreement and the provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (" _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.

1.02 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause to be filed a
properly executed certificate of merger conforming to the requirements of the
DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as is agreed by the
parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_
").

1.03 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the Certificate of Merger, the applicable provisions
of the DGCL and as follows:

(a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

(b) The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated at and as of the Effective Time to read as did the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation will remain
unchanged). Such amended certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall continue in full force and effect until further amended in
the manner prescribed by the provisions of the DGCL. (c) The by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all
references to Merger Sub in the by-laws shall be changed to refer to the
Surviving Corporation) until amended in accordance with applicable law.

(d) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualify in the manner provided in
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation or
as otherwise provided by law, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and will serve
until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualify in the
manner provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

(e) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, by virtue of the
Merger and without further act or deed, at the Effective Time all property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.04 _Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Closing Date Payments_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of any stockholder of the Company,
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(i) each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) each share of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including restricted
shares but excluding Dissenting Shares, shares held by the Company as treasury
stock and shares held by any of the Companys Subsidiaries) shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the
Purchase Price Per Share, _plus_ (B) a _pro rata_ portion of the remaining
Escrow Amount, if any, at the time of its distribution in accordance with
the allocation pursuant to _Section 1.04(b)_, _plus_ (C) a _pro rata_
portion of the remaining Stockholder Representative Expense Amount, if any, at
the time of its distribution in accordance with the allocation pursuant to 
_Section 1.04(b)_; and

 



2 (iii) each share of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock that
is owned by (i) the Company as treasury stock, (ii) any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) Parent, (iv) Merger Sub or (v) any other
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist, without any conversion
thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(b) _Escrow Amount and Stockholder Representative Expense Amount_. Each
Consideration Recipient shall be deemed to have contributed such
Consideration Recipients Percentage Share of the Escrow Amount and
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount to the Escrow Account and
Stockholder Representatives, respectively, for distribution to the
Consideration Recipients in accordance with this _Section 1.04(b)_.

(i) Within five (5) Business Days following the First Escrow Release Date, if
and to the extent the remaining First Escrow Amount as of the First Escrow
Release Date (after giving effect to the payment of any Transaction Fees
Deficiency Amount that may be owed to Parent pursuant to  _Section 1.04(g)_)
(the " _Aggregate First Escrow Balance_ ") exceeds the aggregate dollar amount
of any unresolved indemnification claims brought pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)(iii)_ or _Section 9.02(a)(iv)_ against the First Escrow Amount and
existing as of the First Escrow Release Date (each an " _Unresolved Special
Indemnification Pending Claim_ " and collectively, the " _Aggregate Special
Indemnification Pending Claim Amount_ "), then the Escrow Agent shall release
from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Aggregate First Escrow Balance
minus the Aggregate Special Indemnification Pending Claim Amount and
distribute to each Consideration Recipient, by wire transfer of same day
funds, such Consideration Recipients Percentage Share of such amount.
Following the First Escrow Release Date, if an Unresolved Special
Indemnification Pending Claim is finally resolved, Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent, within three (3) Business Days after the final resolution of such
Unresolved Special Indemnification Pending Claim, a written notice instructing
the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to each Consideration
Recipient an amount determined by multiplying such Consideration Recipients
Percentage Share by the amount (if any) by which the aggregate remaining First
Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account as of the date of resolution of such
Unresolved Special Indemnification Pending Claim exceeds the aggregate amount
of the contested amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved
Special Indemnification Pending Claims.

 

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days following the Second Escrow Release Date,
if and to the extent the remaining Second Escrow Amount as of the Second
Escrow Release Date (the " _Aggregate Second Escrow Balance_ ") exceeds the
aggregate dollar amount of any unresolved indemnification claims brought
pursuant to _Article IX_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include
any unresolved claims made under the Rep and Warranty Policy which may give rise
to a claim for payment under _Section 9.01(b)_ or a claim under _Section
9.02(a)_ in accordance with  _Section 9.01(b)_ because it is not a Covered
Claim) and existing as of the Second Escrow Release Date (each an "
_Unresolved Other Pending Claim_ " and collectively, the " _Aggregate
Unresolved Other Pending Claim Amount_ "), then the Escrow Agent shall
release from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Aggregate Second Escrow
Balance minus the Aggregate Unresolved Other Pending Claim Amount and
distribute 

 



3  to each Consideration Recipient, by wire transfer of same day funds, such
Consideration Recipients Percentage Share of such amount. Following the
Second Escrow Release Date, if an Unresolved Other Pending Claim is finally
resolved, Parent and the Stockholder Representatives shall jointly execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days after the final
resolution of such Unresolved Other Pending Claim, a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to each
Consideration Recipient an amount determined by multiplying such Consideration
Recipients Percentage Share by the amount (if any) by which the aggregate
remaining Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account as of the date of resolution of
such Unresolved Other Pending Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the
contested amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved Other Pending
Claims. 

(iii) Promptly upon determination by the Stockholder Representatives that all
or a portion of the remaining Stockholder Representative Expense Amount is no
longer necessary for expenses payable pursuant to _Section 10.14(g)_, the
Stockholder Representatives shall distribute to each Consideration Recipient,
by wire transfer of same day funds, such Consideration Recipients Percentage
Share of the then remaining Stockholder Representative Expense Amount. For the
avoidance of doubt, the latest date in which the Stockholder Representatives
shall distribute to each Consideration Recipient, by wire transfer or same
day funds, such Consideration Recipients Percentage Share of any remaining
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall be five (5) Business Days
following the date in which all Unresolved Special Indemnification Pending
Claims and Unresolved Other Pending Claims have been resolved.

(c) _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Parent shall:

(i) pay to holders of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock (including
restricted shares but excluding Dissenting Shares, shares held by the Company
as treasury stock and shares held by any of its Subsidiaries) an amount equal
to the portion of the Purchase Price payable to such stockholders pursuant
to  _Section 1.04(d)_;

(ii) pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing
the indemnification obligations of the Consideration Recipients under
_Article IX_ and as the exclusive source of recovery for payment of the
Deficiency Amount, if any, payable to Parent, to be held in an escrow account
(the " _Escrow Account_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Escrow

Indebtedness (subject to contingent obligations to the extent provided in the
applicable credit agreement which customarily survive any such discharge); and
(ii) the amount payable to each person to which a Transaction Fee is due and
payable at Closing in order to fully discharge such Transaction Fees. 

 



4 (d) _Payments; Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of one or
more certificates in valid form representing the shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class C Common Stock, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers and a Letter of Transmittal to the Company at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, such certificates to be
surrendered to Parent on or promptly following the Closing Date, the holder of
such certificate shall receive from Parent, the Escrow Agent or the
Stockholder Representatives, as applicable, in exchange for each share of
Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock represented by such
certificates, by wire transfer of same day funds (A) on the Closing Date, the
Purchase Price Per Share in accordance with  _Section 1.04(a)_, (B) a _pro
rata_ portion of the remaining Escrow Amount, if any, at the time of its

(C) a _pro rata_ portion of the remaining Stockholder Representative Expense
Amount, if any, at the time of its distribution in accordance with the
allocation pursuant to _Section 1.04(b)_. Until so surrendered, each such
certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive such consideration as set forth in _Section 1.04(a)_ or
to receive payment for Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. To the extent any certificates are not surrendered on or prior to three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date as provided in the first sentence
of this _Section 1.04(d)_, then upon surrender of such certificates to
Parent, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers
and a completed Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such certificate shall
be entitled to promptly receive from Parent, the Escrow Agent or the
Stockholder Representatives, as applicable, in exchange therefor, by wire
transfer of same day funds (A) the Purchase Price Per Share in accordance with
_Section 1.04(a)_, (B) a _pro rata_ portion of the remaining Escrow Amount,
if any, at the time of its distribution in accordance with the allocation
pursuant to _Section 1.04(b)_ and (C) a _pro rata_ portion of the remaining
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount, if any, at the time of
its distribution in accordance with the allocation pursuant to _Section
1.04(b)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any portion of any of the
payments to Stockholders described in _Section 1.04(a)(ii)_ and this 
_Section 1.04(d)_. If any certificate representing shares of Class A Common
Stock or Class C Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance provided by the Company, of
that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, an indemnity agreement against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent,
the Escrow Agent or the Stockholder Representatives, as applicable, will pay
to the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, in exchange for
each share of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock represented
thereby, by wire transfer of same day funds (A) the Purchase Price Per Share

Amount, if any, at the time of its distribution in accordance with the

and Class C Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive
the consideration described in _Section 1.04(a)(ii)_ and this _Section
1.04(d)_ (and any certificates representing such shares) shall be
automatically cancelled and cease to exist and thereafter,

 



5  holders of such shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except the right to
receive the consideration described in  _Section 1.04(a)(ii)_ and this
_Section 1.04(d)_. Any portion of cash unclaimed by holders of Class A Common
Stock or Class C Common Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) At the close of business on the date of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
stock of the Company shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing shares of any Class A Common Stock or Class C Common
Stock (in each case, other than Dissenting Shares) are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and, as applicable, exchanged
for the consideration set forth in this _Section 1.04_, subject to the
arrangements described in _Section 1.04(b)_.

 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock
that, as of the Effective Time are or may entitle the holder thereof to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive a portion of the consideration in accordance
with _Section 1.04(d)_, and the holder or holders of such shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the status of any such shares as
shares carrying appraisal rights shall not be perfected, or if any such shares
shall lose their status as shares carrying appraisal rights, then as of the
later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status
or the loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in
this _Section 1.04_, subject, if still applicable, to the arrangements
described in _Section 1.04(b)_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands
for appraisal and any other demands served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL received by Company prior to the Effective Time in connection with the
Merger and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment or settlement offer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(g) _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the Stockholder Representatives a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Companys calculation of Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Fees, in each case as of 11:59 PM New York City time on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing. During the thirty (30) days
immediately following the Stockholder Representatives receipt of the Closing
Statement (the " _Closing Statement Review Period_ "), the Stockholder
Representatives 

 



6  and their representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal
business hours to review the Companys working papers and the working papers
of the Companys independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Fees therein, as well as the relevant books and records of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of the
Company shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the
Stockholder Representatives unless and until the Stockholder Representatives
have signed customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreements relating
to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to such independent accountants. The Stockholder Representatives shall notify
Parent in writing (the " _Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement_ ") prior
to the expiration of the Closing Statement Review Period if the Stockholder
Representatives disagree with the Closing Statement or the Closing
Indebtedness or Transaction Fees set forth therein. The Notice of Closing
Statement Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such disagreement, the amounts involved and the Stockholder Representatives
determination of the Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Fees, in each case
as of 11:59 PM New York City time on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of
a Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement, the Stockholder Representatives
and Parent shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Closing Statement
Disagreement. If no Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement is received by
Parent on or prior to the expiration date of the Closing Statement Review
Period, then the Closing Statement and the Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Fees set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have
been accepted by the Stockholder Representatives and shall become final and
binding upon the Stockholder Representatives, the Consideration Recipients,
the Company and Parent. Additionally, all items in the Closing Statement or
the Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Fees set forth therein not so disputed
in the Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement shall become final and
binding upon the Stockholder Representatives, the Consideration Recipients,
the Company and Parent. If the parties cannot agree on the Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Fees within such thirty (30)-day period, the
Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Fees, in each case solely to the
extent not agreed between Parent and the Stockholder Representatives, shall be
determined by Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). The
Stockholder Representatives and Parent shall furnish the Independent
Accountant with a statement setting forth the items from the Notice of Closing
Statement Disagreement which are still in dispute (the " _Independent
Accountant Dispute Notice_ "). In the event that Ernst and Young LLP refuses or
is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, the Stockholder
Representatives and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national
recognition mutually agreeable to the Stockholder Representatives and Parent,
in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty
(30) days after the submission of such matters to the Independent Accountant,
or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on
the Stockholder Representatives and Parent, of the appropriate amount of each
of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is disagreement
as specified in the Independent Accountant Dispute Notice. With respect to
each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either the Stockholder Representatives or Parent, shall not be in
excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the

 



7 amounts advocated by Parent in the Closing Statement or the Stockholder
Representatives in the Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement with respect
to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters in the Independent Accountant
Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The amounts of Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Fees, in each case as of 11:59 PM New York City time on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing, that are final and binding on
the Stockholder Representatives and Parent, as determined either through
agreement of the Stockholder Representatives and Parent (deemed or otherwise)
or through the determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to this 
_Section 1.04(g)(i)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Closing
Indebtedness Amount_ " and " _Final Transaction Fees Amount_ ", respectively.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, Parent and the Stockholder
Representatives shall each make available to the Independent Accountant such
individuals and such information, books, records and working papers, as may be
reasonably required by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.04(g)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the independent accountants of Parent or the Stockholder Representatives shall
not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne by the Stockholder Representatives and Parent in inverse proportion
as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Accountant, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Independent
Accountant at the time the determination of the Independent Accountant is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. For the avoidance of doubt
and solely as an illustration of the methodology set forth in the preceding
sentence, if (i) the Notice of Closing Statement Disagreement assigns values
to the disputed matters such that the calculation of Closing Indebtedness as
of 11:59 PM New York City time on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing set forth in the Closing Statement would be decreased by
$1,000,000, (ii) Parent maintains that the Closing Indebtedness as of 11:59 PM
New York City time on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing set
forth in the Closing Statement is correct and (iii) the Independent
Accountants final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with this
_Section 1.04(g)_ is that the Closing Indebtedness as of 11:59 PM New York
City time on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing is decreased
from the amount set forth in the Closing Statement by $600,000 (i.e., 60% of
the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of the Stockholder
Representatives), then the Stockholder Representatives shall be responsible
for 40% of the cost of the Independent Accountant and Parent shall be
responsible for 60% of the cost of the Independent Accountant. For the
avoidance of doubt, Transaction Fees as of 11:59 PM New York City time on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing will include for all purposes
under this Agreement all amounts that would be Transaction Fees if the Closing
were deemed to have occurred at such time.

 

(ii) If (x) the sum of the Final Closing Indebtedness Amount and the Final
Transaction Fees Amount is _less than or equal to_ (y) the sum of the Maximum
Closing Indebtedness Amount and Maximum Transaction Fees Amount, then there
will no adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



8 (iii) If (x) the sum of the Final Closing Indebtedness Amount and the
Final Transaction Fees Amount is _greater than_ (y) the sum of the Maximum
Closing Indebtedness Amount and Maximum Transaction Fees Amount (the amount of
such difference, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "), Parent shall be paid by
wire transfer of same day funds promptly (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Closing Indebtedness Amount and Final
Transaction Fees Amount have been agreed upon or determined by the Independent
Accountant) such Deficiency Amount solely from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, _provided_ that to the
extent that any portion of such Deficiency Amount is the result of the Final
Transaction Fees Amount exceeding the Maximum Transaction Fees Amount (such
amount, the " _Transaction Fees Deficiency Amount_ ") the payment from the
Escrow Account of the Transaction Fees Deficiency Amount will be deemed to
first reduce the First Escrow Amount and then the Second Escrow Amount. Any
such recovery of all or a portion of the Deficiency Amount from the Escrow
Account shall be Parents exclusive source of recovery for payment of the
Deficiency Amount.

 

(iv) Any Deficiency Amount paid to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 1.04_ shall be deemed to be and treated, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes.

1.05 _Cancellation of Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Options held by any current or
former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other person
(collectively, the " _Optionholders_ " and each an " _Optionholder_ ") granted
under any stock option, stock purchase or other equity or employee incentive
plan, program or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the " _Incentive
Plans_ ") shall be canceled and the Optionholders of such Company Stock
Options shall not be entitled to receive any consideration for the
cancellation of all such Company Stock Options held by such Optionholder.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the Incentive Plans
shall terminate as of the Closing Date.

1.06 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Stockholder Representatives and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this _Article I_ such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or the Treasury Regulations, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law and to properly remit such amount to the
appropriate Taxing Authority. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

1.07 _Working Capital Projections_. Attached to _Schedule 1.07_ solely for
illustrative purposes are projections of Working Capital and Indebtedness of
the Jostens Division, in each case as of each of October 3, 2015 and October
31, 2015. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor Stockholder
Representatives make any representations or warranties with respect to the
projections attached to _Schedule 1.07_ and the Parent Indemnitees will have
no right to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_.

power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each
other agreement, document or certificate contemplated by this Agreement and to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Company Documents_ ") and

applicable to any of the foregoing; or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any material asset or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for
such conflicts, violations, defaults, breaches, terminations, suspensions or
acceleration of performance and liens which would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or would
not prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations
under this Agreement in all material respects.

3.05 _No Consents_. Assuming the accuracy of Parents representations, no
consent, approval, license, permit, order, qualification or authorization of,

regulatory status of Parent or (v) any consent, approval, authorization,
exemption or filing which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or would not prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement in all material respects.

3.06 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. The Company and its Subsidiaries hold
all material Permits required to conduct their businesses as currently being
conducted, and as conducted during the one-year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, or to own, lease or operate their properties, and all such
Permits are in full force and effect and no cancellation or suspension of any
such Permit is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2013 have been, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws and the terms of
the Permits; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company makes no representation

environmental matters, which matters are exclusively addressed in _Section
3.13_, _Section 3.15_ and _Section 3.17_, respectively. Since January 1,

material respect of any applicable Law or any of the terms or conditions of
any material Permits, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no investigation,
inspection, audit or other proceeding by any Governmental Authority is
threatened. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since January 1,
2005, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective agents have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the
_Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act_ (Canada). To this end, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries states affirmatively that since January
1, 2005 they have not in connection with their business or operations of
their business, directly or indirectly (e.g., through agents) corruptly

or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened which

(the " _SEC_ ") since December 29, 2012 (collectively, the " _SEC Reports_
"), each of which, when filed, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Report, each as in
effect on the date so filed. None of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light

 



15  of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements included in the SEC Reports complied at the
time it was filed as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto.

necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain accountability for Assets and (ii) the recorded
accountability for Assets is compared with the existing Assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
"disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the reports that they file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of V Sub to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Since January 1, 2012, there have
not been (A) except as set forth in _Schedule 3.09(e)_ , any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or which are otherwise also
liabilities of or related to its ownership of its Subsidiaries.

Effect, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, or is
reasonably expected to incur, any Liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a

delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(alone or in combination with any other event): (i) result in any payment
becoming due, accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or
increase the amount of compensation due to any such employee, consultant,
officer or director; or (ii) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could

payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(g) Except as set forth on  _Schedule 3.13(g)_ , none of the Plans promise
retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as

state Law or pursuant to and consistent with the terms of a Plan.

(h) No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company no condition
exists, that would subject the Company or its Subsidiaries to any material
liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws by reason of

within which the Company or its Subsidiaries are also included, as provided
in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time.

 



34 (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, preserve and

and reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice, to any Stockholder Representative, on behalf of any
Consideration Recipient, as may be reasonably required by such party in
connection with any insurance claims by, claims or actions or Tax audits
against, governmental investigations of, or compliance with legal requirements
or Tax reporting obligations by, any Consideration Recipient or any of their
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent desires to dispose of any
such books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall, prior to any
such disposition, notify the Stockholder Representatives and provide the
Stockholder Representatives a reasonable opportunity, at the Stockholder
Representatives expense, to make copies of or remove such books and records.

 

6.09 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain public or private debt or equity financing or bank financing in
connection with the payment of the consideration payable in respect of the

including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries

Parent and that is customary in connection with the Financings, including the
following: (i) assisting with due diligence activities relating to the
Companys financial information; (ii) participation in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and rating agencies sessions in connection with the Financings; (iii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
bank information memoranda and similar documents required in connection with
the Financing; (iv) executing and delivering any customary pledge and security

agreement or pledge shall be effective until the Closing; (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain from their respective representatives,
customary certificates, accountants comfort letters (and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to

Parent with (A) the audited consolidated balance sheets of V Sub as of
December 29, 2012, December 28, 2013 and January 3, 2015, and the related
audited statements of operations and cash flows for the three years ended
January 3, 2015, and the notes and schedules thereto and (B) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of V Sub and the Company as of July 4, 2015 (and
as of the end of any subsequent quarterly period ended no less than 45 days
prior to the Closing Date) and the related unaudited statements of income and
cash flows for such quarterly period or periods; and (vii) using reasonable
best efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance reasonably requested by
Parent; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , further, that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or obligation
under any loan agreement and related documents, unless and until the Closing
occurs in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (3) incur any other
liability in connection with any Financing, unless and until the Closing
occurs in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (4) be required to
take any action that will (x) conflict with or violate the Companys or its
Subsidiaries organizational documents or any Laws or (y) result in the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or a default under, any contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective pre-
Closing directors, officers, employees, equity holders, partners, members,
managers, agents or representatives and other Affiliates from and against any
and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financings and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financings; _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or
their marks.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to
be obligated, until such time as the Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms and subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ , to complete the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall provide each current employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who is employed at the Closing (" _Company Employees_ ")
with compensation that is substantially similar in the aggregate to the
compensation provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to annual base salary and wage rates, annual cash
bonus target opportunities, and employee benefits (including, without

 



36  limitation, perquisites and paid time off)). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent shall or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment
terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time, under any
circumstances that would give rise to a right of severance payments and
benefits under the applicable severance plans, agreements, guidelines or
arrangements, each as referenced on _Schedule 3.13(a)_ , subject to such
Company Employees execution of a release of claims in a form customarily
provided to similarly-situated employees of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with the severance payments and benefits
that such Company Employee would have received under the applicable severance
plans, agreements, guidelines or arrangements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, (and for the avoidance of doubt, in each case,
such severance payments and benefits offered to Company Employees thereunder
shall be determined taking into account the service crediting provisions set
forth in _Section 6.10(b)_ below);  _provided_ , _however_ , if any such
Company Employee is entitled to severance benefits under an individual
severance, employment or similar agreement, the terms of such agreement and
not this _Section 6.10(a)_ shall govern.

 

(b) For all purposes (including, as applicable, for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Company Employees after the Effective Time (including the Plans) (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under
a Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing disability, medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

 



37 (c) Nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any employee benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or
any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan
or from terminating the employment of any Company Employee. The provisions of
this _Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 6.10_, express or implied, shall
confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement
or a right of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person
under an employee benefit plan that such employee or beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan
without regard to this Agreement.

 

(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its applicable Subsidiaries to comply with all of their respective
obligations under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Company shall
notify the PBGC in writing of the existence of this Agreement to the extent
required by Law. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts
to give each other party hereto a reasonable opportunity to participate in
any oral or written communications, discussions or negotiations with the PBGC.
Each party hereto shall promptly notify each other party hereto of any
communication received from the PBGC, and shall provide a copy of any such
communication that is written.

6.11 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent applicable,
the Company shall submit to its stockholders for approval, meeting the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, all payments and/or benefits to be made by the Company and its
Subsidiaries that in the absence of such a vote could reasonably be,
separately or in the aggregate, "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) made to any
individuals that are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section
280G(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder); provided that in
no event shall this _Section 6.11_ be construed to require the Company or
any Subsidiary to actually obtain stockholder approval. The Company shall
provide Parent, prior to submission to the Companys stockholders, copies of
the documents prepared by the Company in connection with this  _Section
6.11_ (including any waivers necessary to validly hold the vote referenced
above) and the calculations prepared under Section 280G of the Code, upon
which the stockholder vote is being sought and reasonably consider any
edits to such documents reasonably requested by Parent. Prior to such vote,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers from
the affected individuals such that unless the payments are approved by the
Companys stockholders to the extent and in the manner required under
Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, no such payments
shall be made.

 

6.12 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any employment agreement or Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of immediately prior 

 



38  to the Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_"), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the DandO Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (the " _D andO Indemnity_"). In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each DandO Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent from
the DandO Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the
extent required by the DGCL or the Companys organizational documents, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
(and in which indemnification could be sought by such DandO Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. At any time following the
Closing, Parent may replace the DandO Indemnity by obtaining, maintaining and
fully paying for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies with substantially the
same scope as the DandO Indemnity, naming the DandO Indemnified Parties as direct
beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing
Date, the cost of which shall be borne by Parent. The Parent shall not, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to, cancel or
change any such insurance policies in any respect.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries (or equivalent governing documents) shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than
are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent
governing documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) The Company shall purchase a single premium tail policy with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance for the former directors and
officers of the disposed businesses set forth on _Schedule 6.12(c)_ in
accordance with the requirements of the purchase and sale agreements relating
to such dispositions and may, at its option, purchase as part of such policy
or as a separate policy a single premium tail policy with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance for other current and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided that the
cost of the above-referenced policy or policies shall be deducted from the
Purchase Price at Closing.

 



39 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section
6.12_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this  _Section
6.12_.

6.13 _Reserved_.

 

6.14 _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (x) the date
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article VIII_ and (y) the Closing
Date, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, take, or direct any
Person acting on its behalf to take, any action to encourage, initiate,
solicit or otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or
enter into any agreement regarding the terms of, any sale of all or
substantially all, of the securities or assets of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries (except for dispositions of inventory and assets in the ordinary
course of business and except for the Disposition), whether such transaction
takes the form of a sale of stock, merger, reorganization, recapitalization,
sale of assets or otherwise or any other transaction which would impair or
impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (each such
transaction being referred to herein as a " _Proposed Acquisition Transaction_
"), with any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates
and their representatives. The Company shall terminate any and all
negotiations or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal
concerning any Proposed Acquisition Transaction and request in writing that
all nonpublic information be returned or destroyed. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent (orally and in writing) if any offer is made with
respect to any Proposed Acquisition Transaction.

6.15  _Redemption of Senior Notes_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause V Sub to deliver a notice to the trustee under the Senior Notes
Indenture (the " _Trustee_ ") with respect to the redemption of the
outstanding Senior Notes, in the form agreed to by Parent, the

 



40  Stockholder Representatives and the Company (the " _Redemption Notice_ ")
and accompanied by such officers certificates, legal opinions and other
documentation in connection therewith as are required under the Senior Notes
Indenture or otherwise to accompany such Redemption Notice reasonably
requested by the Trustee and Parent shall make the payment to the Trustee
contemplated by _Section 1.04(c)(iv)_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with the Trustee, on behalf of and pursuant to an instruction letter
from V Sub, funds sufficient to satisfy and discharge the outstanding Senior
Notes in accordance with Sections 401, 1101, 1102, 1105 and 1106 of the
Senior Notes Indenture, and the Company shall cause V Sub to otherwise fully
comply with the other provisions of Sections 401, 1101, 1102, 1105 and 1106 of
the Senior Notes Indenture in order to satisfy and discharge the Senior Notes.

 

6.16 _Tax Matters_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Parent. Parent shall,
at its own expense, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Tax Returns and other documentation required to be filed by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any such Taxes.

 

6.17 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. At and as of the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate or cause to be terminated, any contract, transaction
or arrangement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any Related Party, on the other hand, to the extent set forth on
_Schedule 6.17_ and all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have
been satisfied or waived in full.

6.18 _Reserved_.

 

6.19 _Options, Phantom Stock Awards and Cash Bonus Plans_.

Company Stock Option for no consideration, effective as of the Effective
Time, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Incentive Plan and

(b) The Company shall terminate the Incentive Plans, including, but not

consents and providing any necessary notices, to (i) effectuate the provisions
of _Section 6.19(a)_ through  _Section 6.19(c)_ of this Agreement.

efforts to dispose of prior to the Closing the interest held by the Company
in Tripolis Holdings S.a.r.l., without further obligation or liabilities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in accordance with _Schedule 6.20_ (the "

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Stockholder
Representatives;

(b) by either Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representatives, on
the other hand, by giving written notice of such termination to the other, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31, 2015 (the
" _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that, in each case, the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
party that is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement; or

 

(ii) any permanent injunction or other order of a Governmental Authority
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in any
material respect shall have become final and non-appealable;

(c) at any time before the Closing, by the Company and the Stockholder
Representatives, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches in any material respect any
of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or breaches
or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a
condition precedent to the Companys obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in  _Section 7.01(b)_ or _Section
7.01(c)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform to Parent by the Company, cannot
be cured or has not been cured by the

 



44  earlier of the Outside Date and ten Business Days after the delivery of such
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this  _Section 8.01(c)_ shall not be available to the Company and the
Stockholder Representatives, if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;
or

 

(d) at any time before the Closing, by Parent, if the Company breaches in any
material respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would render a condition precedent to Parents obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_ or _Section
7.01(c)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform to the Company and the
Stockholder Representatives by Parent, cannot be cured or has not been cured
by the earlier of the Outside Date and ten Business Days after the delivery of
such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.01(d)_ shall not be available to Parent if
Parent is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this

forthwith be given to the other parties specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void, and there shall be no liability on the part of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as
set forth below, nothing herein shall relieve any party to this Agreement from
liability arising from willful or intentional material breach hereof prior to
such termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that _Section 6.02_ __ _,_
___Section 6.07_, the penultimate sentence of _Section 6.09(b)_, this
_Section 8.02_ and _Article X_  (and any related definitional provisions
throughout this Agreement) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.



   ARTICLE IX. | _INDEMNIFICATION._ 
---|--- 

9.01 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and remain in full
force and effect until and including the date that is two years following the
Closing Date. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that
contemplate survival thereof following the Closing Date shall survive the
Closing Date in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if proper notice of an
indemnification claim or a claim under _Section 9.01(b)_ is given in
accordance with this Agreement before the expiration of the applicable
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty, then notwithstanding the
expiration thereof, any claim based on such covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty, as the case may be, shall survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of such claim.

 



45 (b) _Rep and Warranty Policy Procedure_. Until the Second Escrow Release Date,
in the event that any Parent Indemnitee shall incur or suffer any Losses in
respect of any Covered Claim, such Parent Indemnitee shall make and diligently
pursue a timely claim under the Rep and Warranty Policy. Parent shall promptly
provide notice (the " _Insurance Claim Notice_ ") of any claim made under the
Rep and Warranty Policy to the Stockholder Representatives, which notice shall
constitute proper notice of a claim under  _Section 9.01(b)_ for purposes of
the last sentence of _Section 9.01(a)_. If payment of such Covered Claim is
subject to the deductible or retention under the Rep and Warranty Policy (the
amount of such applicable deductible or retention or the unpaid balance of
such Covered Claim due to the Rep and Warranty Policys limitation on liability,
the " _Claim Amount_ "), the Parent Indemnitees shall provide to the
Stockholder Representatives evidence thereof and the Stockholder
Representatives shall execute a joint instruction with Parent to release from
the Escrow Account the Claim Amount, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.02(d)_. In no event shall the aggregate amount required to be
paid under this _Section 9.01(b)_ exceed the then remaining Escrow Amount.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the delivery of the
Insurance Claim Notice shall serve to preserve all rights hereunder until and
to the extent that such indemnifiable claim is determined to be a Covered
Claim under the Rep and Warranty Policy and if such claim is determined by the
insurer not to be a Covered Claim, then such claim shall be subject to
_Section 9.02(a)_ and Parent shall be required to deliver the required Claim
Notice with respect thereto under _Section 9.02(c)_ but for purposes of
determining whether such notice is timely made prior to the Second Escrow
Release Date, such notice will be deemed to have been given on the date of the
Insurance Claim Notice. In the event that it is determined by the insurer
under the Rep and Warranty Policy that a claim is a Covered Claim but that
there was no breach of the underlying representation or warranty, Parent
shall not be permitted to make any claim for indemnification with respect to
the same breach under _Section 9.02(a)_.

 

9.02 _Indemnification Generally_.

 

(a) _By the Consideration Recipients_. Subject to the provisions set forth in
this _Section 9.02_, from and after the Closing Date, the Consideration
Recipients shall, severally in proportion to their applicable Percentage Share
(and not jointly), be responsible for and shall pay and indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, and their
respective representatives (the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") solely out of the
Escrow Account from, against and in respect of, the amount of any and all
liabilities, damages, claims, deficiencies, fines, assessments, losses,
Taxes, penalties, interest, costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, but excluding any and all
punitive damages, consequential or exemplary damages except for any of the
foregoing that are actually paid to a third party pursuant to a third party
claim (collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered by any of the Parent Indemnitees
(" _Parent Losses_ ") arising from, in connection with, or incident to any of
the following: (i) any breach or violation of any of the covenants or
agreements of the Company or the Stockholders Representatives contained in
this Agreement, (ii) any breach or violation of any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in _Article III_ of this Agreement that is not a
Covered Claim, (iii) any Transaction Fees that have not been paid at the
Closing or reflected in the Final Transaction Fees Amount and (iv) any matter
set forth on  _Schedule 9.02(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, no
indemnification may be sought hereunder for a Covered Claim, recovery with
respect to

 



46  which shall be subject to Section 9.01(b) and in no event shall the
aggregate amount required to be paid by the Consideration Recipients under
this _Section 9.02(a)_ exceed the then remaining Escrow Amount.

(b) _By Parent_. Subject to the provisions set forth in this _Section
9.02_, from and after the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the
Consideration Recipients from, against and in respect of, the full amount of
any and all Losses arising from, in connection with, or incident to (i) any
breach or violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Parent and Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement and (ii) any breach or violation of any
representation or warranty of Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Article V_
of this Agreement.

(c) _Indemnity Procedure_. A party or parties hereto agreeing to be
responsible for or to indemnify against any matter pursuant to this Agreement
is referred to herein as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and the other party or
parties claiming indemnity is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party._ " For
purposes of this _Section 9.02(c)_, where the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party are the Consideration Recipients, all notices shall be given
to or made by the Stockholder Representatives. 

(i) An Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall, with respect to claims
(other than Covered Claims which shall be subject to _Section 9.01(b)_)
asserted against such party by any third party, give prompt written notice
(including a copy of such claim if such claim is in writing) to the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability which might give rise to a claim for
indemnity under this Agreement (" _Claim Notice_ "), provided, however, that
any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent the rights of the Indemnifying Party
are materially prejudiced. The Claim Notice shall state in reasonable detail
the nature and basis of such third party claim and the dollar amount of such
claim, if known.

 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of
delivery of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party (A) whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes Liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with
respect to the third party claim, and, if so, the basis for such a dispute,
and (B) if the Indemnifying Party does not dispute Liability, whether or not
the Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to defend against the third party claim. In no event shall
the Indemnified Party admit any liability with respect to such claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against the third party
claim, it may conduct the defense of such claim (including investigating and
remediating such claim) through counsel of its choosing (subject to the
Indemnified Partys approval of such counsel, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and it shall be solely responsible for the expenses of
such defense and shall be bound by the results of its defense or settlement of
the claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such claim without
prior notice to and consultation with the Indemnified Party, and no such
settlement involving (x) any equitable relief, (y) a finding or admission of
a violation of applicable Law or violation of the

 



47  rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or (z) a finding or admission
that would have a material adverse effect on other claims made or threatened
against the Indemnified Party may be agreed to without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
unless such settlement includes a complete and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liabilities in respect of such claim; it being
understood that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle any claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party if such settlement involves only
the payment of monetary damages. So long as the Indemnifying Party
is diligently contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party
may pay or settle such claim only at its own expense and the Indemnifying
Party will not be responsible for the fees of separate legal counsel to the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Indemnifying Party will
bear the reasonable expenses of such separate legal counsel to the Indemnified
Party if the defense in, or targets of, any such claim include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by counsel that there are or are reasonably likely to be
legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party or that representation by the same
counsel is or is reasonably likely to be a conflict of interest. The
Indemnified Party may not settle or otherwise dispose of any claim for which
the Indemnifying Party may have a liability under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party
does not make such election, or having made such election, the Indemnifying
Party fails to diligently defend against the third party claim, then the
Indemnified Party may (after written notice to the Indemnifying Party), at the
reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, elect to take over the defense
of and proceed to handle such claim in its discretion and the Indemnifying
Party shall be bound by any defense or settlement that the Indemnified Party
may make in good faith with respect to such claim; _provided_ that with
respect to any failure of the Indemnifying Party to diligently defend against
any third party claims, the Indemnified Party must provide notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such failure and the Indemnified Party may only take
over the defense of such third party claim if the Indemnifying Party does not
cure such failure within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice or, if
the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel that permitting such
30-day cure period is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Indemnified
Party with respect to such third party claim, such shorter period as may be
reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party in consultation with its legal
counsel, which shorter cure period will be set forth in such notice to such
Indemnifying Party. In connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party will
fully cooperate with the Indemnified Party should the Indemnified Party elect
to take over the defense of any such claim.

 

(iv) The parties agree to cooperate in defending such third party claims and
the Indemnified Party shall provide such cooperation and such access to its
books, records and properties as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
request with respect to any matter for which indemnification is sought
hereunder; and the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense thereof.

(v) With regard to claims of third parties for which indemnification is
payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid by the Indemnifying
Party promptly upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the entry of a judgment
against the Indemnified Party and the expiration of any applicable
appeal period; (ii) the entry of an unappealable judgment or final

 



48  appellate decision against the Indemnified Party; or (iii) a settlement of
the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that there is no good faith
dispute as to the applicability of indemnification, the reasonable expenses
of counsel to the Indemnified Party and the other reasonable costs of
defending such claim shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the
Indemnifying Party in the case of any claim in which the Indemnifying Party
has not assumed the defense. With regard to other claims for which
indemnification is payable hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid
promptly within five (5) Business Days by the Indemnifying Party upon demand
by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
payments by the Consideration Recipients as the Indemnifying Party, such
payments shall be made solely by the Escrow Agent from the then remaining
Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(vi) With regard to claims for which indemnification may be payable
hereunder which do not involve a claim being sought to be collected by a
third party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim, specifying the nature of such claim and the
amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible, provided,
however, that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the
Indemnified Party, except to the extent the rights of the Indemnifying Party
are materially prejudiced. If the Indemnifying Party either accepts such
claim or does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
the date of receipt of the claim notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes
such claim, with a statement of the basis of such position, the amount of
such claim shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder and such indemnification claim shall be paid promptly by the
Indemnifying Party. With respect to payments by the Consideration
Recipients as the Indemnifying Party, such payments shall be made solely by
the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If an objection is made in writing in
accordance with this  _Section 9.02(c)(vi)_, the Indemnified Party shall
respond in a written statement to the objection within twenty (20) days and,
for forty (40) days thereafter, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to such claim (and, if the parties
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both parties).

 

(d) _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(i) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no payments
under _Section 9.01(b)_ or any indemnification payment under _Section
9.02(a)(ii)_, in each case relating to breaches of representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein, shall be made to the Parent
Indemnitees until the sum of the aggregate amount of (x) claims under
_Section 9.01(b)_ plus (y) Parent Losses equal at least $1,500,000, at which
time the Parent Indemnitees shall be indemnified dollar-for-dollar to the
extent of any and all amounts paid from the Escrow Amount under _Section
9.01(b)_ and Parent Losses from the first dollar of such amounts paid from the
Escrow Amount under _Section 9.01(b)_ and Parent Losses, provided, that such
limitation shall not apply to amounts paid from the Escrow Amount under
_Section 9.01(b)_ or Parent Losses arising from breaches of representations
or warranties of the Company in _Sections_ _3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.08_ ,
_3.14(a)_ (but only with respect to breaches of _Section 3.14(a)_ resulting
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having taken any action prohibited
by _Sections 6.05(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(ix)_ or
_(x)_ between the date hereof and the Effective Time) _3.15_ , _3.24_ and
_3.25_ , or with respect to a claim of fraud or willful misconduct.

 



49 (ii) If an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company or a breach of any covenants of the Company gives rise to a
Deficiency Amount or a reduction in the Maximum Transaction Fees Amount, then
such inaccuracy or breach shall not give rise to an indemnification obligation
under  _Section 9.02(a)_ to the extent of the Losses taken into account in
the calculation of such Deficiency Amount and such Deficiency Amount has been
paid in accordance with this Agreement or to the extent the Maximum
Transaction Fees Amount has been reduced in accordance with _Section
6.05(d)_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the sole recourse of the Parent Indemnitees following the Closing against the
Consideration Recipients for Losses from claims under _Section 9.01(b)_ or
_Section 9.02(a)_ will be the remaining balance of the Escrow Account at any
time.

(e) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification under this Agreement after
all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this _Article IX_ the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party (or in the case of the Consideration Recipients as the
Indemnifying Party, the Stockholder Representatives on behalf of the
Consideration Recipients) the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party (including from the Escrow Account in the case of the
Consideration Recipients) in respect of such Loss, _plus_ the amount received
from the third party in respect thereof, _less_ (ii) the amount of the
relevant Loss.

 

(f) Parent Indemnitees may not recover more than once in respect of any
Losses. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or any of its
Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other
provision of this Agreement.

(g) All payments (a) made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party
in respect of any claim pursuant to _Sections 9.02(a)_ or _9.02(b)_ , and (b)
made pursuant to _Section 6.16_, shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(h) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ , "Losses" shall be net of any
insurance amounts or other amounts from third parties actually received by
the Parent Indemnitees in connection with the facts giving rise to the right
of indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , if Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates receive any insurance
proceeds or third party recovery as a result of the matter giving rise to any
indemnification claim of such Indemnified Party against the Consideration
Recipients after the Escrow Agent (on behalf of the Consideration Recipients)
have paid from the Escrow Account such indemnification claim to such
Indemnified Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over any
such insurance proceeds or third party recovery received to the
Stockholder Representatives on behalf of the Consideration Recipients to the
extent of the payments made from the Escrow Amount to such Indemnified Party
on the claim.

 



50 (i) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ , Taxes shall not
constitute "Losses" to the extent such Taxes are reduced or offset by any Tax
credit, deduction or other Tax asset attributable to a Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on and including the Closing Date.

 

9.03 _Exculpation of Financing Sources._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no Seller Related Party (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall
have any rights or claims against any Seller Related Party (other than Parent
and Merger Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following
consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the
parties to the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. In
addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous nature.

 

9.04 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing Date, the remedies
provided for in this _Article IX_ shall be exclusive and shall preclude
assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking of any
and all other remedies against the Indemnifying Party for claims based on this
Agreement, other than for (a) actions for specific performance or other
equitable remedies or (b) Losses arising out of or relating to fraud. Each
party hereby waives any provision of applicable Law to the extent that it
would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this _Section
9.044_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the right of
recovery provided under _Section 9.01(b)_ and the indemnification provided
for in _Section 9.02_ shall terminate on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Indemnified Party in respect
thereof thereafter), except that the right of recovery under _Section
9.01(b)_ and the indemnification of the Indemnified Party shall continue as to
any Claim Amount or Losses, as the case may be, of which any Indemnified
Party has notified the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the requirements
of this _Article IX_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would
otherwise terminate in accordance with this  _Article IX_, as to which the
indemnification obligation hereunder shall continue until the liability shall
have been determined pursuant to this _Article IX_, and all Indemnified
Parties for such Losses in accordance with and subject to the limitations of
_Article IX_.

Schedules hereto and the documents referred to herein) and the Escrow
Agreement contain, and are intended as, a complete statement of all of the

_however_ , that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect.

 



51 10.02 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court determines that it does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any other appropriate Delaware State or Federal court), for
any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), and further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
its respective address set forth in _Section 10.04_ shall be effective
service of process for any litigation brought against it in any such court.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any litigation arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby in such
courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such litigation brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Seller Related Party
and each of the other parties hereto (i) agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof), (ii) submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) agrees that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to it at its address provided in _Section 10.04_ shall be effective service
of process against it for any such action brought in any such court, (iv)
waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
action in any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such
action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the parties hereto hereby waive
their respective rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based
upon or arising out of this Agreement or any dealings between them relating to
the subject matter of this transaction. The parties hereto also waive any bond
or surety or security upon such bond which might, but for this waiver, be
required of any of the other parties. The scope of this waiver is intended to
be allencompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and
that relate to the subject matter of this Agreement, including contract
claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common Law and
statutory claims. The parties hereto acknowledge that this waiver is a
material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has
already relied on the waiver in entering into this Agreement and

 



52  that each will continue to rely on the waiver in their related future
dealings. The parties hereto further warrant and represent that each has
reviewed this waiver with its or his, as the case may be, legal counsel, and
that each knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following
consultation with legal counsel. This waiver is irrevocable, meaning that it
may not be modified either orally or in writing, and the waiver shall apply
to any subsequent amendments, renewals, supplements or modifications to this
Agreement or to any other documents or agreements relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed
as a written consent to a trial by the court. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each Seller Related Party and each other party hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights of
trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim (whether based upon
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including any action, proceeding or counterclaim against any
Financing Source.

10.03 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended
or modified except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the
parties hereto. Any party may waive compliance by another with any of the

10.05 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such
provision shall be of no force and effect as to that jurisdiction, but the
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall have no effect upon and shall
not impair the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in
that or any other jurisdiction.

10.06 _Assignment and Binding Effect_. None of the parties hereto may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. All of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on, and shall inure to the
benefit of, the respective legal successors and permitted assigns of the
parties.

10.07 _No Benefit to Others_. Except as provided in _Section 6.12_ and
_Section 10.08_ (the provisions of which Sections shall inure to the benefit
of the person or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third
party beneficiaries thereof), the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and they shall
not be

 



55  construed as conferring and are not intended to confer any rights on any
other persons, _except that_ the Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries of  _Section 9.03_, _Section 10.02_, and _Section
10.03_, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and
enforce the provisions of such Sections.

10.08 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance or breach of this
Agreement including, any representation or warranty made or alleged to have
been made in, in connection with or as an inducement to, this Agreement or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby (each of the above described
legal, equitable or other theories or sources of liability, a " _Recourse
Theory_ "), may only be made against the entities and persons that are
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in their capacities as such
and no person who is not a party hereto, including any Consideration
Recipient and any former, current or future stockholders, equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, general or limited
partners, members, managers, agents or Affiliates of any party hereto, or any
former, current or future direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
member, manager, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-
Recourse Party_ ") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of the parties to this Agreement or for any such claim or causes of action
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, any Recourse Theory. Without limiting the rights of any party
against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its
Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims under any
Recourse Theory against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-
Recourse Party.

10.09 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions
of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the party seeking the injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief has an adequate remedy of Law. To the
extent any party hereto brings any action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action solely to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.02_ hereof) when
available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which
such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other
time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 



56 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and each party
thereto may become a party hereto by executing a counterpart hereof. This
Agreement and any counterpart so executed shall be deemed to be one and the
same instrument.

 

10.11 _Interpretation_. Article titles, headings to sections and the table of
contents are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended
to be a part or to affect the meaning or interpretation hereof. The Schedules
referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of this
Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any
schedule hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material,
and no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes hereof. As used herein, "
_include_ ," " _includes_ " and " _including_ " are deemed to be followed
by "without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such
words or words of like import; " _writing_ ," " _written_ " and comparable
terms refer to printing, typing and other means of reproducing words in a
visible form; " _hereof_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereunder_ " and comparable terms
refer to the entirety hereof and not to any particular article, section or
other subdivision hereof or attachment hereto; references to the masculine
include the feminine and vice versa; references to the singular include the
plural and vice versa; references to this Agreement or other documents are as
amended or supplemented from time to time; references to " _Article_ ," "
_Section_ " or another subdivision or to an attachment or " _Schedule_ " are
to an article, section or subdivision hereof or an attachment or Schedule
hereto.

 

10.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The numbered sections and subsections referenced
in each Schedule correspond to the numbered sections and subsections of the
Agreement. Any disclosure made on any Schedule shall be deemed to be a
disclosure only to the indicated Schedule, except to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to or relevant to another Schedule of this Agreement, even if there
is no cross reference in such Schedule to such other Schedule. The inclusion
of any information on any Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment by the Company, in and of itself, that such information is
required to be listed on any Schedule or is material to or outside the
ordinary course of the business (except where expressly stated in the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
shall not be construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under
any Law or in any dispute or controversy. In addition, matters reflected in
any Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in such Schedule. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount
in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material (except where expressly stated in the relevant
representation, warranty or covenant), and shall not be construed as an
admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in any dispute or
controversy. To the extent a disclosure in any Schedule makes reference to or
describes a provision of any agreement or other document, such reference or
description is

 



57  qualified in its entirety by the actual terms and provisions of such
agreement or other document. Agreements and documents referenced within an
agreement or document disclosed in any Schedule shall not be deemed to be
disclosed pursuant to a Schedule unless and to the extent specifically
referred to in such Schedule. The information contained in any Schedule is in
all respects subject to any Confidentiality Agreement.

 

10.13 _No Presumption_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent
and there shall be no presumption against the draftsman.

10.14 _Stockholder Representatives_.

(b) The Stockholder Representatives will not be liable for any act taken or
omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,

arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representatives carrying
out their duties under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of

(d) If Fusion Acquisition LLC or Gamma LP resigns in writing as a Stockholder

Representative.

and expenses, if applicable) incurred by such Stockholder Representative in
performing any actions under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Any
portion of the Stockholder Representative Expense Amount shall otherwise
remain available to the Stockholder Representatives for such purposes until
such time as the Stockholder Representatives shall distribute any or all of
such funds to the Consideration Recipients based on each such Consideration
Recipients Percentage Share pursuant to _Section 1.04(b)_.
