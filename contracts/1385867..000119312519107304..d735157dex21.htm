following its mailing, no amendment or supplement to the Stockholder Notice shall be made by the Company without the approval of Parent. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business,
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or its counsel, may be required or advisable to be included under Delaware Law in the Stockholder Notice or in any amendment or supplement thereto, and Parent and the Company

will not, on the date the Information Statement is first sent or furnished to the Stockholders, contain any statement which, at such time, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
