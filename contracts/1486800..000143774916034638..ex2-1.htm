waived, may extend the Offer, without the Company's consent, on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or
such longer or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree), until such
time as all Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without the Company's written consent, Merger Sub shall not extend the
Offer beyond the earlier of the End Date and the termination of this

shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer Expiration Time on one or more
occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or
such longer or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree), until such
time as all Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier
of the End Date and the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ ,
that, if the Minimum Tender Condition is the sole then-unsatisfied Offer
Condition as of any Offer Expiration Time, so long as the Minimum Tender
Condition remains as the sole unsatisfied Offer Condition, Merger Sub shall
only be required to extend the Offer Expiration Time for additional periods
not to exceed an aggregate of twenty (20) Business Days.

 



 

(d) _Consummation of the Offer; Payment_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall

required by Applicable Law. Parent shall (A) give the Company reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments
and supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or
dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company, (B) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company,

the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the responses
to any such comments and a copy of any proposed written responses thereto

and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and delivered to the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, all in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, and take all other necessary or
appropriate actions to cause the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h) of
the DGCL without the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company. The Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, notwithstanding such express election to cause the Merger
to be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the Merger may not be so
effected for any reason, then the parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary to cause the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable
following the consummation of the Offer in a manner permitted by the DGCL that
is not adverse to the stockholders of the Company or to Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on such date and
at such time as when the Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time and date
as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate
of Merger.

 



 

Section 2.05 ___Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the

the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

 



 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_, _Section 2.07_ or
_Section 2.08_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 



 

(b) each Share owned by the Company (including treasury shares), Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto, and each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto; and

 



 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.06

 |  

 __ _Surrender and Payment_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ "; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to include
references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section 2.12_
or to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares). As
of the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall have taken all steps
necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be held in trust for the
benefit of the holders entitled to receive Merger Consideration and paid in
respect of the Certificates (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that
it is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.
Any investment of the Payment Fund shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). Promptly after the Effective Time and in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of
Shares at the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_,
a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company agree
prior to the consummation of the Offer) for use in such payment.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a
Certificate promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent or
(ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or
transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of such Certificate.

 



 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) _No Other Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and, from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, the holder of such Certificates shall be given a copy of a
letter of transmittal and instructed to comply with the instructions therein
in order to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 



 

Section 2.07 _____________Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.05_
or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's
right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice and/or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

being understood and agreed that from and after the Effective Time, no Company

Section 5.10

 |  

 __ _Available Funds; Solvency_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub have and at all times through the Closing will
have available financial resources to pay, and will have at the Closing all
funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration, as the case may be, and sufficient for the satisfaction of all
of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to and after giving effect to the consummation of
each of the Transactions, assuming that the Company is solvent immediately
prior to the consummation of each of the Transactions and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company in all material respects
relevant to the representations set forth in this _Section 5.10(b)_:

 



 

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going-concern basis) of the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be greater than
the total amount of their liabilities, taken as a whole (including all
Liabilities);

 



 

(ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay their debts and
obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and

 



 

(iii) Parent and its Subsidiaries will have adequate capital to carry on
their businesses and all businesses in which they are about to engage.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Equity Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, correct and complete copy of the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of
the date hereof (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes, amendments, and supplements, as well as all letters and agreements
ancillary or related thereto _,_ the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), by and
among Parent and Providence Equity Partners VI L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership, and Providence Equity Partners VI-A L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (collectively, the " _Sponsor_ "), pursuant to which the Sponsor
has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide cash equity and/or debt financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") to
Parent in the amount set forth therein in connection with the Transactions.
There are no exhibits, schedules, annexes, amendments, supplements, letters,
agreements, or understandings relating to the Equity Financing or the Equity
Commitment Letter to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is subject or a
party (other than those set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) that, prior
to the date hereof, have not been delivered to the Company. No party is in
default or breach under any of the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letter and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach thereunder or a failure of any condition to the
obligations in the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise result in the failure
of any portion of the Equity Financing to be disbursed in a timely enough
manner to finance, without delay, the consummation of each of the
Transactions, in each case, as of the date hereof. The commitments and terms
contained in the Equity Commitment Letter have not been amended, modified,
supplemented, rejected, reduced, terminated, withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect and the Sponsor has not notified Parent of any intention to do any of
the foregoing. The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect in the
form so delivered and constitutes valid and binding obligations of Parent and
the Sponsor. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition to
be satisfied by it contained in the Equity Commitment Letter or that any
portion of the Equity Financing will not be available to Parent in a timely
enough manner to finance, without delays, its and Merger Sub's obligations
under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition
to the acceptance for payment, or the payment for, any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, to the Closing of the Merger or to any of the
obligations under _Section 2.08_ that the Equity Financing or any alternative
financing shall be available or have been obtained or disbursed.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.12 _______No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article 5_, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates nor any other Person on behalf
of any of them makes or has made any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or with respect to any other information provided, or made
available, to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the Transactions, including
the accuracy or completeness thereof. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that, except for the representations and warranties made by the Company
in _Article 4_ (as qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedules), neither the Company nor any other Person is making or
has made any representations or warranties, expressed or implied, at law or in
equity, with respect to or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, their businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations, future operating or financial results,
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
other matter furnished or provided to Parent or Merger Sub or made available
to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual
data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of,
or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and Merger
Sub are not relying and specifically disclaim that they are relying upon or
have relied upon any such other representations or warranties that may have
been made by any Person, and acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Affiliates have specifically disclaimed and do hereby specifically disclaim
any such other representations and warranties. Parent and Merger Sub have
conducted their own independent investigation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and the Transactions and have had an opportunity to discuss and
ask questions regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries' businesses
with the management of the Company.

not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, its and their respective

Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any
standstill provision or similar provision that has the effect of prohibiting
the counterparty thereto from making an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.02(a)_ by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a
breach of this _Section 6.02(a)_ by the Company.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company receives an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 6.02_), the Company and the Company Board and/or their
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.02(b_ _)_ ,
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information and
reasonable access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and/or
its Representatives or potential financing sources if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, and based on information then available, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, or result in, a Superior Proposal; _provided,_ that (i) prior to
furnishing any material nonpublic information, the Company receives from such
Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) any such
material nonpublic information so furnished has been previously provided or
made available to Parent or is provided or made available to Parent promptly
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after it is so furnished to
such Third Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may, following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal,
contact the Third Party that has made such Acquisition Proposal to clarify and
understand the terms and conditions thereof to facilitate the Company Board's
determination with respect to whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, a Superior Proposal
(without negotiating or suggesting improvements to the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.02(c)_ or in _Section 6.02(d)_, until the termination of this Agreement,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the Board Recommendation, (B) take any
action to exempt any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) from the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other applicable state takeover
statute or (C) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or
propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") or (ii) allow the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or similar agreement or arrangement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with any Third Party providing for an
Acquisition Transaction or potential Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions, or requiring the
Company to fail to comply with this _Section 6.02_ (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, in the
event a material development or material change in circumstances (other than
an Acquisition Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement
that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation
if the Company Board determines, after consultation with its legal advisor,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
has provided Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons for such action.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer if, in response to an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement
that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 6.02_, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation and/or the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section 6.02(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section 6.02(d)_ unless the Company (x) has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.02_,
including its obligations set forth in _Section 6.02(e)_, (y) pays, or causes
to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.04(b)_ concurrently with such termination and (z) concurrently with such
termination, enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement that
documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section 6.02(d)_ and the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ (x) unless
the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent that the
Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action and the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreement (it being understood that, in the event of any change in
the per share consideration or form of consideration offered under, or any
other material amendment or modification of, any Acquisition Proposal, the
time periods in this _Section 6.02(e)_ shall be extended by two (2)
additional Business Days) and (y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other
adjustments that may be irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent (the most
recent such adjustments, the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4)
Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the
Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

 



   



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within four (4) Business Days following
its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes an offer that, as determined
in good faith by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board shall have no
right to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)_ and
the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ as a result of such Acquisition
Proposal, unless such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently determined by the
Company Board to be a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.02(d)_,
in which case _Section 6.02(e)_ shall apply to such determination.

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company receives
any Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, if applicable,
provide to Parent the material terms and conditions (including, unless
prohibited by the terms of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
entered into with respect to any potential Acquisition Transaction existing as
of the date of this Agreement, the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i)
keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
any such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) promptly (and in any event within one (1)
Business Day) notify Parent of any material change to the material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal or any determination by the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_, (iii) promptly notify Parent if the Company
or, to the Company's Knowledge, such Third Party has made a final decision to
not pursue such Acquisition Proposal and (iv) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt or
delivery thereof of any written indication of interest (or amendment thereto)
or any written material that constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto)
including copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any
financing commitments related thereto.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (iii) the accurate disclosure of factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or (iv) the accurate disclosure of the fact that an
Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and/or
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , that in all
cases, any such action or disclosure shall comply with _Section 6.02(c)_ and
_Section 6.02(d)_.

251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, without a
stockholders meeting, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Applicable Law, Contract of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Order,
(ii) would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment
of any attorney-client, work product privilege or Intellectual Property right

extent practicable, the Company, each Company Subsidiary and each of their
Representatives have taken commercially reasonable steps to provide access to
or to disclose such information on a basis that does not result in the effects
described in clauses (i) through (iii), and (B) in the case of clause (ii),
such access and information shall be granted or made available, as applicable,
to external counsel for Parent (subject to external counsel entering into a
customary common interest agreement with the Company, on terms mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Company).

 



 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to _Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be
deemed to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by the Company contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions
hereof or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or

on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the
Company in this Agreement.

provided to it or any of its Representatives by the Company or any of its

 __ _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who
are employed by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_
"), Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers) prior to the
Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate,
levels of benefits and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe or
other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving
Corporation (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any
Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the
extent such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits or in benefit
accrual under a defined benefit plan. Additionally, each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Benefit
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement.

 



 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing
Date, Parent shall provide (i) salary and target bonus opportunity (or base
pay for non-salaried employees) for each Continuing Employee at least equal to
the salary and target bonus opportunity (or base pay) that such Continuing
Employee had at the Company for the fiscal year in which the Closing Date
occurs and (ii) benefits (excluding any equity plans, but including profit
sharing plans, severance plans and health and welfare benefit plans) at least
as favorable, in the aggregate, to each Continuing Employee as benefits
(excluding any equity plans, but including profit sharing plans, severance
plans and health and welfare benefit plans) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent
Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived
under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee was a participant immediately prior to his commencement of
participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but only to the extent permitted
under the terms and conditions of Parent's applicable insurance contracts in
effect as of the Closing Date and (ii) credit co-payments or deductibles paid
by Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Closing occurs for
purposes of satisfying any deductible or co-payment requirements under the
applicable Parent Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing
employment, retention, incentive, change in control and severance agreements
between the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and any Company Employee.

 



 

(e) No later than ten (10) days prior to Closing, with respect to each
"officer" of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) (each a " _Section 16 Officer_ ") and any other "disqualified
individual" of the Company (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), the
Company shall furnish a schedule that sets forth (i) the Company's reasonable,
good faith estimate of the maximum amount that could be paid to such Section
16 Officer or other disqualified individual as a result of any of the
Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section
16 Officer or other disqualified individual, and (iii) underlying
documentation on which such calculations are based.

 



 

(f) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.06_ are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any Company Employee, any
participant in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or any
beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section
6.06_ shall be deemed to amend any Company Employee Plan or any Parent Benefit
Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to permit any Person to participate in any particular benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to continue or
amend any particular benefit plan, before or after the consummation of the
Transactions, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance
with its terms and Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 6.07 ___State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

(b) Parent shall not adopt or publicly propose a plan of complete or
partial liquidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization,

(d) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
enter, or agree or commit to entrance, into agreements with respect to, or
consummate, any mergers or business combinations, or any acquisition of any

advances or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other Person, in

Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably requested by Parent under Applicable Law and rules and policies of

Section 6.10

 |  

 __ _Director and Officer Liability_. 

---|---|--- 
 



 

 



   



 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain
officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section
6.10(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Current
Premium_ ") and, if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
300% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, cause to be maintained policies of
insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or
"runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of
the Transactions, and which it is hereby acknowledged by Parent are permitted
to be obtained by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such policies shall not be obtained without
Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if the premiums therefor would exceed $1,000,000 in
the aggregate. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain such policies in full force and effect
for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) each indemnification, exculpation or expense reimbursement or advance
agreement in effect between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of, or serving as a director or
officer of another Person at the request of, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ," and each such indemnification
agreement, a " _D andO Indemnification Agreement_"); and (ii) any
indemnification or expense reimbursement or advance provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or other similar Organizational Documents of any Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall each cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar Organizational Documents) of the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and advance of expenses of
directors and officers of the Company for periods at and prior to the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and in the bylaws of the Company and such Company Subsidiaries.
To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the DandO Indemnification Agreements to continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) If either of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, by
contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall survive
the Effective Time and shall thereafter not be terminated or amended in any
manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party.

shall provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the
opportunity to participate in any discussion or meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in

case of Parent, its Affiliates), or (ii) to limit the ability of such entities
to conduct their businesses or operate or own assets or properties; _provided_
, _however_ , that, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), Parent may provide
that the closing of any such transaction or the effectiveness of any such
limitation shall be conditioned on the Closing.

Directors, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_, the Company shall pay Parent a fee in immediately available funds
in the amount of $10,392,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") concurrently with

_Section 8.01_ _(b)(i)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)(iii)_ and

reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit.

but subject to _Section 9.09_ (which shall not be limited by this _Section

fees, expenses, Liabilities, penalties or losses of any kind suffered as a
result of or in connection with this Agreement (including the negotiation,
execution, performance or breach thereof), the failure of the Transactions to
be consummated or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company-Related Parties shall have any further Liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions under any
theory of law or equity, contract, tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that the
payment of the Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 9.04(e)_ shall not affect
Parent's right to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_9.04(d)_ except to the extent set forth in the last sentence of _Section
9.04(e)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.04(_ _h_
_)_ shall limit any right or remedy of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
fraud or Intentional and Material Breach by the Company or relieve the Company
of any Liability with respect to fraud or its Intentional and Material Breach

out of or related hereto or to the Transactions or to the inducement of any
party hereto to enter into this Agreement, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity and
performance, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that
would refer a matter to the laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 9.07 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the

inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each
party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly

hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would
not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or

to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and

(subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section

under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or limit any party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any
time.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 9.10 ___Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance

Exhibit A

 



 

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 



 

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer but subject to the terms set forth
in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Exchange Act Rule 14e-1(c) (relating to Merger Sub's obligation to
pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal
of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, if and
only if:

 



 

(i) at the Offer Expiration Time, there shall not have been validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of Shares that,
together with the number of Shares then-owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, represents a majority of the Shares then-
outstanding (excluding from the denominator any Shares owned by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 



 

(ii) at the Offer Expiration Time, any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

 



 

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of Offer
Expiration Time:

 



 

(A) any Order issued by a Governmental Authority, or any Applicable Law
shall be in effect that would (1) make the Offer or the Merger illegal or (2)
otherwise prevent the consummation thereof;

 



 

(B) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth (1) in
_Section 4.06(a)_ (Capitalization) or _Section 4.24_ (Brokers' Fees) of the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects, except to the
extent that any inaccuracies in _Section 4.06(a)_ or _Section 4.24_ would be
de minimis; (2) in _Section 4.11(b)_ (No Company Material Adverse Effect) of
the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects and/or (3)
each other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in the Merger
Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects (after disregarding
any qualifications that reference material, materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect) except to the extent that any inaccuracies in such
representations or warranties would not constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect, in the case of clauses (B)(1), (B)(2) and (B)(3), as if such
representations and warranties were made on and as of the Offer Expiration
Time (or, in the case of such representations and warranties made only as of a
specified time or date, on and as of such specified time or date);

 



 

(C) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant
of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
Agreement prior to such time;

 



 

(D) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate
signed by a senior executive officer of the Company dated the date on which
the Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (B), (C)
and (E) of this paragraph (iii) do not exist;

 



 

 



   



 

(E) since the date of the Merger Agreement, there shall have occurred a
Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(iv) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

The foregoing conditions set forth in clause (iii) above are for the sole
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion
of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and Applicable Law. The foregoing conditions set forth in clauses
(i) and (iv) may only be waived with the prior written consent of the Company.
Any reference in this _Exhibit A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition
or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to
which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
