**ARRANGEMENT  AGREEMENT**

 

 

**This  Arrangement Agreement** **** (this  " ** _Agreement_** ")  is 
entered into as of July 28, 2008, among:

 

 

**Gran  Tierra Energy Inc.** ,  a  Nevada corporation (hereinafter referred
to as " ** _Gran  Tierra_** ")

 

 

-  and -

 

 

**Solana  Resources Limited** ,  an  Alberta corporation (hereinafter
referred to as " ** _Solana_** ")

 

 

-  and -

 

 

**Gran  Tierra Exchangeco Inc.**   (" ** _Gran  Tierra Exchangeco_** "), 
an  Alberta corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gran Tierra Callco 
ULC

 

 

**Recitals**

 

 

**Whereas:**

 

 

**A.** The  respective boards of directors of Gran Tierra, Solana and Gran
Tierra Exchangeco  each deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective  stockholders and shareholders to combine their respective
businesses by Gran  Tierra Exchangeco acquiring common shares of Solana
pursuant to the Plan of  Arrangement (as hereinafter defined), subject to the
terms and conditions  contained herein.

 

 

**B.** In  furtherance of such combination, the respective boards of
directors of Gran  Tierra, Solana and Gran Tierra Exchangeco have approved
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, the board of directors of
Solana has agreed  to  submit the Plan of Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby  to  its shareholders (the " ** _Solana 
Shareholders_** "),  warrantholders and optionholders (the warrantholders and
optionholders, together  with the Solana Shareholders, " ** _Solana_**
**_Securityholders_** ")  and  the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta (the "
** _Court_** ")  for  approval, and the board of directors of Gran Tierra
has agreed to submit the  issuance of the shares of Gran Tierra Common Stock
(as hereinafter defined)  issuable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  and  the Plan of Arrangement, to its
stockholders for approval.

 

 

**Now,  Therefore** ,  in  consideration of the premises and of the
representations, warranties, covenants  and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally  bound, agree as follows:

 

 

**ARTICLE  1**

 

 

**GENERAL**

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**1.1** **Plan  of Arrangement**

 

 

As  promptly as practicable after the preliminary Joint Proxy Statement (as 
hereinafter defined) is cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission  (the " ** _SEC_** "),  Solana  will apply to the Court pursuant
to Section 193 of the _Business  Corporations Act_   (Alberta), as amended,
(the " ** _ABCA_** ")  for an  interim order of the Court under Subsection
193(4) of the ABCA containing  declarations and directions with respect to
the Arrangement (as hereinafter  defined), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Gran Tierra (such  order as it may be affirmed, amended or
modified by the Court, the " ** _Interim  Order_** ")  providing for, among
other things, the calling and holding of the Solana  Securityholders Meeting
(as hereinafter defined) for the purpose of considering  and, if deemed
advisable, approving the arrangement (the " ** _Arrangement_** ")  pursuant
to Section 193 of the ABCA and pursuant to this Agreement and the  Plan  of
Arrangement substantially in the form of **Exhibit  A**   (as  amended or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with Article  6 thereof,  the
" ** _Plan  of Arrangement_** ").  If the  Solana Securityholders approve
the Arrangement and all necessary approvals  of  Gran Tierra stockholders
are obtained, Solana will take the necessary steps  to  submit the
Arrangement to the Court and apply for a final order of the Court  approving
the Arrangement pursuant to Subsection 193(9)(a) of the ABCA, in  form  and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Gran Tierra (such order as it may  be 
affirmed, amended or modified by the Court, (the " ** _Final  Order_** "). 
Upon  issuance of the Final Order and subject to satisfaction or waiver (in
respect  of  those conditions that can be waived) of the conditions
precedent in Article  6,  each of Gran Tierra and Gran Tierra Exchangeco on
the one hand and Solana on  the  other hand shall execute and deliver such
closing documents and instruments  and  forthwith proceed to file the
articles of arrangement in respect of the  Arrangement required under
Subsection 193(10) of the ABCA to be sent to the  Registrar after the Final
Order has been granted (the date of such filing,  the  **"** ** _Effective 
Date_** **"** ),  giving  effect to the Arrangement (the " ** _Articles  of
Arrangement_** "),  the  Final Order and such other documents as may be
required to give effect to the  Arrangement with the Registrar pursuant to
Subsection 193(9) of the ABCA,  whereupon the transactions comprising the
Arrangement shall occur (the time  of  such filing, the " ** _Effective 
Time_** ")  and  shall be deemed to have occurred in the order set out
therein without any  further act or formality.

 

 

**1.2** **Adjustments  to Exchange Ratio**

 

 

The  Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement) shall be adjusted
to  reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend  (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Gran  Tierra Common Stock or Solana Common Shares (as hereinafter
defined)), merger,  reorganization, recapitalization or other like change
with respect to Gran  Tierra Common Stock or Solana Common Shares occurring
after the date hereof  and  prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

**1.3** **Dissenting  Shares**

 

 

Holders  of Solana Common Shares will have rights of dissent with respect to
such shares  in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner
set forth  in  Section 191 of the ABCA, as modified by Article 4 of the Plan
of Arrangement.  Holders of options (" ** _Solana  Options_** ")  and 
warrants (" ** _Solana  Warrants_** ")  to  acquire Solana Common Shares
will not have rights of dissent with respect to  such securities in
connection with the Arrangement. Solana shall give Gran  Tierra (i) prompt
notice of any written demands of a right of dissent,  withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the  ABCA and received
by Solana, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all  negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such rights. Without the prior  written consent
of Gran Tierra, except as required by applicable law, Solana  shall not make
any payment with respect to any such rights or offer to settle  or  settle
any such rights.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**1.4** **Joint  Proxy Statement; Registration Statement**

 

 

**a.** As  promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Gran
Tierra and  Solana shall prepare and Gran Tierra shall file with the SEC a
preliminary  joint  management information circular and proxy statement (the
" ** _Joint  Proxy Statement_** "),  together with any other documents
required by the Securities Act of 1933, as  amended (the " ** _Securities 
Act_** "),  or the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " **
_Exchange  Act_** "),  in  connection with the Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.  The Joint Proxy Statement shall constitute
(i) the management information  circular of Solana with respect to the
meeting of Solana Securityholders  relating to the Arrangement and the
approval of certain matters in connection  therewith (the " ** _Solana 
Securityholders Meeting_** "),  and  (ii) the proxy statement of Gran Tierra
with respect to the meeting of  stockholders of Gran Tierra with respect to
the issuance of Gran Tierra Common  Stock from time to time after the
Effective Time in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement (the  " ** _Gran  Tierra Stockholders
Meeting_** ").  As  promptly as practicable after the preliminary Joint
Proxy Statement is cleared  by the SEC and, if required by the SEC, after the
Registration Statement is  declared effective and subject to receipt of the
Interim Order, Gran Tierra  and  Solana shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to each company's  respective securityholders entitled
to vote, as the case may be. As promptly  as  practicable after execution of
this Agreement, Gran Tierra shall file a  registration statement (the " **
_Registration  Statement_** ")  with  the SEC to register the issuance of
the Gran Tierra Common Stock to be issued  from time to time after the
Effective Time upon the exchange of the exchangeable  shares to be issued by
Gran Tierra Exchangeco as contemplated by the Plan of  Arrangement (the " **
_Exchangeable  Shares_** ")  and the  exercise of the Solana Warrants which
shall by their terms upon the Effective  Date become automatically
exercisable into Gran Tierra Common Stock (the " ** _Gran  Tierra
Warrants_** "),  if  such offering may be included on the Registration
Statement. Gran Tierra and  Solana shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration  Statement to become effective. If the
Registration Statement is filed and  becomes effective, Gran Tierra will use
its commercially reasonable efforts  to  maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement for so long as any  Exchangeable Shares or Gran Tierra
Warrants remain outstanding or until such  earlier time as Gran Tierra
determines that the securities covered by such  Registration Statement have
been sold, or may be sold without volume  restrictions pursuant to Rule 144,
as determined by the counsel to Gran Tierra  pursuant to a written opinion
letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable  to  Gran Tierra's transfer
agent.

 

 

**b.** Each  party shall promptly furnish to the other parties all
information concerning  such party and its securityholders as may be
reasonably required in connection  with any action contemplated by this
Section 1.4. The Joint Proxy Statement  and  the Registration Statement
shall comply in all material respects with all  applicable requirements of
law. Each of Gran Tierra and Solana will notify  the  other promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request  by  the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the  Registration
Statement, or for additional information, and will supply the  other  with
copies of all correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy 
Statement or the Registration Statement. Whenever any event occurs which
should  be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement or  the  Registration Statement, Gran Tierra or Solana, as the
case may be, shall  promptly inform the other of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the  SEC, and/or mailing to securityholders entitled
to vote of Gran Tierra and  Solana, as may be applicable, such amendment or
supplement.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**c.** Gran  Tierra and Solana shall take any action required to be taken
under any  applicable provincial or state securities laws (including "blue
sky" laws) in  connection with the issuance of the Gran Tierra Common Stock
and the  Arrangement; provided, however, that with respect to the blue sky
and Canadian  provincial qualifications, neither Gran Tierra nor Solana shall
be required  to  register or qualify as a foreign corporation or reporting
issuer where any  such  entity is not now so registered or qualified except
as to matters and  transactions arising solely from the offer and sale of the
Gran Tierra Common  Stock or the issuance of the Exchangeable Shares.

 

 

**1.5** **Material  Adverse Effect or Material Adverse Change**

 

 

In  this  Agreement, the term " ** _Material  Adverse Effect_** "  or "
** _Material  Adverse Change_** "  used  with respect to any party means
any matter or action that has an effect or  change that is, or could
reasonably be expected to be, material and adverse  to  the business,
operations, assets, capitalization, financial condition or  prospects of such
party and subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but excluding any  matter, action,
effect or change occurring after the date of this Agreement  relating to or
resulting from: (i) general economic, financial, currency  exchange,
securities or commodity prices in Canada, the United States or  elsewhere,
(ii) conditions affecting the oil and gas exploration,  exploitation,
development and production industry as a whole, and not  specifically
relating to any party or its respective subsidiaries (in the case  of Solana,
the " ** _Solana  Subsidiaries_** ")  and  (in the case of Gran Tierra,
the  " ** _Gran  Tierra Subsidiaries_** "),  including changes in laws
(including tax laws) and royalties, (iii) any decline  in crude oil or
natural gas prices on a current or forward basis, (iv) any  matter which has
been publicly disclosed or has been communicated in writing  to  the other
party as of the date hereof **, ** (v)  the  results of any well commenced
or completed by Gran Tierra or Solana, as the  case  may be, after the date
hereof (it being the intention of the parties that a  determination that any
one or more wells completed or commenced after the date  hereof (provided
that the capital expenditures relating to such wells have  been  included in
such party's 2008 capital budget previously provided to the other  party) is
not capable of commercial production shall not be considered to be  a 
Material Adverse Change for the purposes of this Agreement or the
Arrangement),  or (vi) matters permitted by this Agreement, the Solana
Disclosure Letter (as  hereinafter defined), the Gran Tierra Disclosure
Letter (as hereinafter defined)  or consented to or approved in writing by
the other party.

 

 

**1.6** **Currency**

 

 

Unless  otherwise specified, all references in this Agreement to " **
_dollars_** " or  " ** _$_** "  shall  mean United States dollars.

**ARTICLE  2** 

 

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF SOLANA**

 

 

Except  as  set forth in a letter dated the date of this Agreement and
delivered by Solana  to Gran Tierra concurrently herewith (the " ** _Solana 
Disclosure Letter_** "),  Solana  hereby represents and warrants to, and
agrees with, Gran Tierra  that:

 

 

**2.1** **Organization  and Standing**

 

 

**a.** Solana  and each body corporate, partnership, joint venture,
association or other  business entity of which more than 50% of the total
voting power of shares  of  stock or units of ownership or beneficial
interest entitled to vote in the  election of directors (or members of a
comparable governing body) is owned  or  controlled, directly or indirectly,
by Solana (the " ** _Solana  Subsidiaries_** "),  is an  entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws  of  the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, has full requisite power 
and authority to carry on its business as it is currently conducted, and to 
own,  lease and operate the properties currently owned, leased and operated
by it,  and  is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing as a  foreign corporation or organization authorized to do business
in all  jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or
leased or the  nature of the business conducted by it would make such
qualification or  licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Solana.  The Solana Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list, as at the date hereof,  of the Solana Subsidiaries and the percentage
of each subsidiary's outstanding  capital stock or other ownership interest
owned by Solana or any Solana  Subsidiary. Except as set forth in the Solana
Disclosure Letter, neither Solana  nor any Solana Subsidiary owns any debt or
equity interests in any entity other  than the Solana Subsidiaries.

 

 

**b.** No  Solana  Subsidiary has total assets which constitute more than 5%
of the consolidated  assets of Solana as at March 31, 2008, or the total
revenues of which constitute  more than 5% of the consolidated revenues of
Solana for the three month period  ended March 31, 2008, other than the
Colombian branch of Solana Petroleum  Exploration (Colombia) Limited (" **
_Solana  Colombia_** ").  As of  the date hereof, Solana is the beneficial
direct or indirect owner of all of  the  outstanding shares, trust units and
partnership units, as applicable, of the  Solana Subsidiaries with good title
thereto free and clear of any and all  encumbrances. There are no options,
warrants or other rights, shareholder or  unitholder rights plans, agreements
or commitments of any character whatsoever  requiring the issuance, sale or
transfer by any of the Solana Subsidiaries  of  any securities of the Solana
Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into,  or  exchangeable or
exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire,  any 
securities of the Solana Subsidiaries. All outstanding securities of the
Solana  Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid and  non-assessable and are not subject to, nor were they issued in
violation of,  any  pre-emptive rights.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**2.2** **Agreement  Authorized and its Effect on Other Obligations**

 

 

**a.** Solana  has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement  and  to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
approval of the Solana  Securityholders and the Court as provided in this
Agreement, to consummate  the  Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The  execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Solana and, subject to approval  of  the Solana Securityholders and the
Court as provided in this Agreement, the  consummation by Solana of the
Arrangement and the other transactions  contemplated hereby have been
unanimously approved by the Solana Board of  Directors and have been duly
authorized by all other necessary corporate action  on the part of Solana.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered  by  Solana and is a
valid and binding obligation of Solana, enforceable in  accordance with its
terms, except that such enforceability may be subject to  (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting  or relating to
enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (ii) general  equitable
principles, and (iii) that the consummation of the Arrangement is  subject to
approval of the Solana Securityholders and the Court as provided  in  this
Agreement.

 

 

**b.** Neither  the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the Arrangement  by  Solana, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby  by Solana nor compliance with the provisions
hereof or thereof by Solana will:  (i) conflict with, or result in any
violations of, the articles of  incorporation or bylaws of Solana or any
equivalent document of any of the  Solana Subsidiaries, (ii) result in any
breach of or cause a default (with  or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, (iii) give rise to a  right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation  contained in, or the loss of
any material benefit or the incurrence of any  material cost (including, but
not limited to, seismic data transfer fees) under,  or (iv) result in the
creation of any lien, charge, mortgage, adverse claim,  hypothec, pledge,
warrant, lease, sublease, encumbrance, right to possession,  security
interest, option, preferential purchase right or other right or  interest of
any other person (collectively, an " ** _Encumbrance_** ")  upon  any of the
material properties or assets of Solana or any of the Solana  Subsidiaries
under, any term, condition or provision of any loan or credit  agreement,
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, judgment,  order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Solana  or
any of the Solana Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, 
other than any such breaches, defaults, rights, losses, or Encumbrances
which,  individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have  a  Material Adverse Effect on Solana.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**2.3** **Governmental  and Third Party Consents**

 

 

**a.** No  consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration  or  filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission
or other  governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign

Solana.

any shares of, or any securities  convertible into, the capital stock of
Solana.

Investment Market of the London Stock  Exchange plc (the " ** _AIM_** ")

relevant  regulations, policies and rules (collectively, the " ** _Solana 
Securities Reports_** "),  all of  which have complied in all material
respects with all applicable requirements  of  such statutes, regulations,
policies and rules. None of the Solana Securities  Reports, at the time filed
or as subsequently amended, contained any untrue  statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to  be  stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of  the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No subsidiary of 
Solana is required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC 
or  the Commissions. The financial statements of Solana contained in the
Solana  Canadian Securities Reports complied in all material respects with
the then  applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations  of  the relevant Canadian securities statutes with respect
thereto, were prepared  in  accordance with Canadian generally accepted
accounting principles applied on  a  consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may have been indicated  in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted  by  applicable laws, rules or
regulations) and fairly present (subject, in the  case  of the unaudited
statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments) the  consolidated
financial position of Solana and its consolidated Solana  Subsidiaries as at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results  of  their
operations and cash flows for the respective periods then  ended.

methods of making  accounting estimates or changes in estimates that are
material to such financial  statements, except as described in the notes
thereto.

 

 

**2.6** **Liabilities**

 

 

Neither  Solana nor any Solana Subsidiary has, and none of Solana or any
Solana  Subsidiary is or would reasonably be expected to become responsible
for  performing or discharging, any accrued, contingent or other liabilities
of  any  nature, either matured or unmatured, that are, individually or in
the aggregate,  material to Solana or any Solana Subsidiary, except for: (a)
liabilities  reflected or reserved against in financial statements contained
in the Solana  Securities Reports; (b) normal and recurring current
liabilities that have  been  incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices  by Solana or any Solana Subsidiary since the
date of the last filed Solana  Securities Report filed on SEDAR; (c)
liabilities for performance of obligations  of Solana or any Solana
Subsidiary under any contracts by Solana or any Solana  Subsidiary, to the
extent such liabilities are readily ascertainable (in nature,  scope and

been delivered to Gran Tierra; (d) liabilities described in part 2.6 of 
the  Disclosure Letter; and (e) liabilities that would not, in the aggregate,

**2.7** **Information  Supplied**

 

 

None  of  the information supplied or to be supplied by Solana for inclusion
or  incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement (and, if filed,
the  Registration Statement) will, at the time the Joint Proxy Statement is
mailed  to  the securityholders of Solana and at the time of the Solana
Securityholders  Meeting (and, if filed, at the time the Registration
Statement is declared  effective), contain any untrue statement which, at the
time and in light of  the  circumstances under which it is made, is false or
misleading with respect to  any  material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not false or misleading  or  necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect  to  the solicitation of
a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has  become false or
misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form  in  all
material respects with the provisions of the ABCA, applicable United States 
and Canadian securities laws, the rules and policies of the TSX Venture
Exchange  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

**2.8** **No  Defaults**

 

 

Neither  Solana nor any Solana Subsidiary is, or has received notice that it

condition or  provision of (a) its articles or bylaws; (b) any judgment,
decree or  order applicable to it; or (c) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond,  mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license or other
instrument  to  which Solana or any Solana Subsidiary is now a party or by
which it or any  of  its properties or assets may be bound, except in the
case of item (c) for  defaults and violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Solana.

 

 

**2.9** **Litigation;  Investigations**

 

 

There  is  no claim, action, suit or proceeding pending, or to the knowledge
of Solana  threatened against Solana or any of the Solana Subsidiaries, which

Material Adverse  Effect on Solana, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order  of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
outstanding against Solana or any  of  the Solana Subsidiaries having, or
which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen,  in the future could have, any
such effect. There is no investigation pending  or,  to the knowledge of
Solana, threatened, against Solana or any of the Solana  Subsidiaries before
any Governmental Entity which could have such  effect.

Material Adverse Effect on  Solana;

any other taxes due and payable have been paid other than those  being
contested in good faith by Solana or a Solana Subsidiary; and the tax 
provision reflected in Solana's financial statements is adequate, in
accordance  with Canadian or United States (if applicable) generally accepted
accounting  principles, to cover liabilities of Solana and the Solana
Subsidiaries for  all  taxes, including any interest, penalties and
additions to taxes of any character  whatsoever applicable to Solana and the

compensation or reimbursement  of ordinary business expenses, nor is there
any indebtedness owing by any such  parties to Solana.

 

 

**2.21** **No  Limitation** ****

 

 

There  is  no non-competition, exclusivity or other similar agreement,
commitment or  understanding in place to which Solana is a party or by which
it is otherwise  bound that would now or hereafter in any way limit the
business or operations  of  Solana in a particular manner or to a particular
locality or geographic region  or for a limited period of time (including,
for greater certainty, following  the  completion of the Arrangement), and
the execution, delivery and performance  of  this Agreement does not and
will not result in the restriction of Solana from  engaging in this business
or from competing with any person or in any geographic  area.

 

 

**2.22** **Information  to Independent Engineer** ****

 

 

Solana  has no reason to believe that the report prepared by DeGolyer and

31, 2007,  evaluating the crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
reserves and  future net production revenues attributable to the properties
of Solana as  of  December 31, 2007 (the " ** _Solana  Reserve Report_**
")  and, if  applicable, any updates to such report or any other reserve
evaluation reports  which may be, or be deemed to be, included or
incorporated by reference in  the  Solana Joint Proxy Statement, whether in
addition to or as a replacement to  the  Solana Reserve Report, was not
accurate in all material respects as at the  effective date of such report
and, except for any impact of changes in commodity  prices, which may or may
not be material, Solana has no knowledge of a Material  Adverse Change in the
production, costs, price, reserves, estimates of future  net production
revenues or other relevant information from that disclosed in  that report.
Solana has provided to DeGolyer and MacNaughton Canada Limited  all 
material information concerning land descriptions, well data, facilities and 
infrastructure, ownership and operations, future development plans and 
historical technical and operating data respecting the principal oil and gas 
assets of Solana, in each case as at the effective dates of such reports
and,  in  particular, all material information respecting the interests of
Solana in  its  principal oil and gas assets and royalty burdens and net
profits interest  burdens thereon and such information was accurate and
correct in all material  respects as at the respective dates thereof and did

respects with all applicable requirements  of  such statutes, regulations,
policies and rules. None of the Gran Tierra  Securities Reports, at the time

applicable laws, rules or regulations) and fairly  present (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end  audit adjustments) the

Subsidiary, except for:  (a) liabilities reflected or reserved against in
financial statements contained  in the Gran Tierra Securities Reports; (b)

Statement is mailed  to  the Securityholders of Gran Tierra and at the time
of the Gran Tierra  Stockholders Meeting (and, if filed, at the time the

statement which, at the time and in  light of the circumstances under which
it is made, is false or misleading with  respect to any material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to  be  stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false  or  misleading or necessary
to correct any statement in any earlier communication  with respect to the
solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject  matter which has
become false or misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will  comply as to form
in all material respects with the provisions of the ABCA  and  applicable
United States and Canadian securities laws and the rules and  regulations
promulgated thereunder.

reasonably be expected to result in a  Material Adverse Effect on Gran
Tierra;

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**d.** To  the  knowledge of Gran Tierra, none of the operations or assets
of Gran Tierra or  any  Gran Tierra Subsidiary has ever been conducted or
used by Gran Tierra or any  Gran Tierra Subsidiary in such a manner as to

for violations which, either singly  or  in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse Effect on Gran Tierra
or have been rectified;

 

 

**e.** No  written notice has been served on Gran Tierra or any Gran Tierra
Subsidiary  from  any entity, governmental agency or individual regarding
any existing, pending  or  threatened investigation or inquiry related to
alleged violations under any  Applicable Environmental Laws, or regarding any
claims for remedial obligations  or contribution under any Applicable
Environmental Laws, or which may require  any material work, repairs,
construction or expenditures, other than any of  the  foregoing which,
either singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be  expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Gran Tierra; and

other authorizations  required pursuant to any Applicable Environmental Laws
to operate and use any  of  Gran Tierra's or the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries'
assets for their current purposes  and uses.

regulation, or any it or decree  of any court or any Governmental Entity, or
delinquent with respect to any  report required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity, except for violations,  defaults and delinquencies

be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on  Gran  Tierra.

 

 

**3.18** **Taxes**

 

 

**a.** Except  with respect to failures which, in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Gran
Tierra, proper and  accurate federal, provincial, state and local income,

turnover, excise, payroll,  property, employment, customs duties and any and
all other tax returns, reports,  and estimates have been filed with
appropriate governmental agencies, domestic  and foreign, by Gran Tierra and
each of the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries for each  period for which any returns,
reports, or estimates were due (taking into  account any extensions of time
to file before the date hereof); all taxes shown  by such returns to be
payable and any other taxes due and payable have been  paid  other than
those being contested in good faith by Gran Tierra or a Gran Tierra 
Subsidiary; and the tax provision reflected in Gran Tierra's financial

of  Gran Tierra and the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries for all taxes, including
any  interest, penalties and additions to taxes of any character whatsoever 
applicable to Gran Tierra and the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries or their assets 
or  businesses. No waiver of any statute of limitations executed by Gran
Tierra  or a  Gran Tierra Subsidiary with respect to any tax is in effect
for any period.  Neither Gran Tierra nor any Gran Tierra Subsidiary has
received any notice  of  reassessment from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
or any applicable state  tax  authority, Revenue Canada or Alberta Corporate
Tax Administration, or any tax  authority in Colombia, Peru or Argentina,
that could reasonably be expected  to  result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Gran Tierra. There are no tax liens  on  any assets of Gran Tierra or the
Gran Tierra Subsidiaries except for taxes  not  yet currently due and those
which could not reasonably be expected to result  in  a Material Adverse
Effect on Gran Tierra.

normal  compensation or reimbursement of ordinary business expenses, nor is
there any  indebtedness owing by any such parties to Gran Tierra.

 

 

**3.21** **No  Limitation** ****

 

 

There  is  no non-competition, exclusivity or other similar agreement,

business or  operations of Gran Tierra in a particular manner or to a
particular locality  or  geographic region or for a limited period of time
(including, for greater  certainty, following the completion of the
Arrangement), and the execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement
does not and will not result in  the  restriction of Gran Tierra from
engaging in this business or from competing  with  any person or in any

gas reserves  and  future net production revenues attributable to the

evaluation  reports which may be, or be deemed to be, included or
incorporated by reference  in the Gran Tierra Joint Proxy Statement, whether
in addition to or as a  replacement to the Gran Tierra Reserve Reports, were
not accurate in all  material respects as at the effective date of such
reports and, except for  any  impact of changes in commodity prices, which
may or may not be material, Gran  Tierra has no knowledge of a Material
Adverse Change in the production, costs,  price, reserves, estimates of
future net production revenues or other relevant  information from that
disclosed in those reports. Gran Tierra has provided  to  Gaffney, Cline and
Associates, all material information concerning land  descriptions, well
data, facilities and infrastructure, ownership and  operations, future
development plans and historical technical and operating  data  respecting
the principal oil and gas assets of Gran Tierra, in each case as  at  the
effective dates of such reports and, in particular, all material information 
respecting the interests of Gran Tierra in its principal oil and gas assets 
and  royalty burdens and net profits interest burdens thereon and such
information  was accurate and correct in all material respects as at the

thereof and there has been  no  Material Adverse Change in any of the
material information so provided since  the  date thereof.

interests of  each  of Gran Tierra and each of the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries
in its petroleum and  natural gas rights and leases and all related
tangibles, equipment, facilities  and miscellaneous interests (collectively,
the " ** _Gran  Tierra Interests_** ")  are  free and clear of Encumbrances
created by, through or under Gran Tierra or  the  Gran Tierra Subsidiaries,
except as disclosed in the Gran Tierra Financial  Statements or those arising
in the ordinary course of business and that would  not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Gran Tierra  and,  to its knowledge,
each of Gran Tierra and each of the Gran Tierra Subsidiaries  holds the Gran
Tierra Interests under valid and subsisting licenses, leases,  permits,
concessions, concession agreements, contracts, subleases, reservations  or

standstill agreement  having terms and provisions substantially similar to
the Confidentiality  Agreement **** (provided  that such confidentiality
agreement shall provide for disclosure thereof (along  with all information

assets, in each case if, and only to the extent  that:

 

 

**(A)** the  third  party has first made a written _bona  fide_   Solana 
Acquisition Proposal which the Solana Board of Directors determines in good 
faith: (i) is funded, in that funds or other consideration necessary for the 
Solana Acquisition Proposal are or are likely to be available; (ii) after 
consultation with its financial advisor would, if consummated in accordance 
with  its terms, result in a transaction financially superior for the
Solana  Securityholders than the Arrangement (in its then current form) and
can be  carried out in a reasonable timeframe; and (iii) after receiving the
advice  of outside counsel, as reflected in minutes of the Solana Board of
Directors  that the taking of such action is necessary for the Solana Board
of Directors  to  discharge its fiduciary duties under applicable law (an "
** _Solana  Superior Proposal_** ")  (and  for the purposes of this
Agreement, a Solana Acquisition Proposal may include  a  Solana Acquisition
Proposal made to Solana by a third party who has entered  into  an agreement
with Solana that contains "standstill provisions", provided that  such Solana
Acquisition Proposal has not been solicited, initiated or encouraged  by
Solana); and

 

 

**(B)** prior  to  furnishing such information to or entering into or
participating in any such  negotiations or discussions with such third party,
Solana provides prompt notice  to Gran Tierra to the effect that it is
furnishing information to or entering  into or participating in discussions
or negotiations with such third party,  together with an executed copy of the
confidentiality agreement referenced  above, and if not previously provided
to Gran Tierra, copies of all information  provided to such third party
concurrently with the provision of such information  to such third party, and
provided further that, Solana shall notify Gran Tierra  orally and in writing
of any inquiries, offers or proposals with respect to  a  Solana Acquisition
Proposal (which written notice shall include, without  limitation, a copy of
such proposal (and any amendments or supplements thereto),  the identity of
the person making it, if not previously provided to Gran Tierra,  copies of
all information provided to such third party and all other information 
reasonably requested by Gran Tierra), within 24 hours of the receipt
thereof,  shall keep Gran Tierra informed of the status and details of any
such inquiry,  offer or proposal and answer any questions of Gran Tierra with
respect  thereto;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**vi.** comply  with Multilateral Instrument 62-104 _Take-Over  Bids and
Issuer Bids_   and  similar provisions under applicable Canadian securities
laws; and

 

 

**vii.** accept,  recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement
a Solana Superior  Proposal from a third party, but only if prior to such
acceptance,  recommendation, approval or implementation, the Solana Board of
Directors shall  have concluded in good faith, after considering all
proposals to adjust the  terms and conditions of this Agreement as
contemplated by Subsection (s) below  and after receiving the advice of
outside counsel as reflected in the minutes  of  the board of directors of
Solana, that the taking of such action is necessary  for the board of
directors in discharge of its fiduciary duties under applicable  law and
Solana complies with its obligations set forth in Subsection (iii)  below 
and terminates this Agreement in accordance with Subsection 7.4(c) and 
concurrently therewith pays the fee to Gran Tierra in accordance with
Subsection  7.4(c).

 

 

**s.** Give  Gran  Tierra, if Solana receives a Solana Superior Proposal,
orally and in writing,  at  least 72 hours advance notice of any decision by
the Solana Board of Directors  to accept, recommend, approve or enter into an
agreement to implement a Solana  Superior Proposal, which notice shall
include a summary of the details of the  Solana Superior Proposal, including
the identity of the third party making  the  Solana Superior Proposal.
During such 72 hour period, Solana agrees not to  accept, recommend, approve
or enter into any agreement to implement such Solana  Superior Proposal and
not to release any the party making the Solana Superior  Proposal from any
standstill provisions and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify  or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement. In addition, during  such 72
hour period, Solana shall and shall cause its financial and legal  advisors
to, negotiate in good faith with Gran Tierra and its financial and  legal
advisors to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable Solana to proceed with the 
Arrangement as amended rather than the Solana Superior Proposal. In the
event  Gran Tierra proposes to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement to
provide  that  the Solana Securityholders shall receive a value per Solana
Common Share equal  to or greater than the value per Solana Common Share
provided in the Solana  Superior Proposal and so advises the Solana Board of
Directors prior to the  expiry of such 72 hour period, the Solana Board 
of  Directors  shall  not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any
agreement to implement such  Solana Superior Proposal and shall not withdraw,
redefine, modify or change  its  recommendation in respect of the
Arrangement.

writing to Solana  or the Solana Shareholders from any person or group of

Arrangement;

insurance or re-insurance companies of  nationally recognized standing

**v.** Promptly  notify Gran Tierra in writing of any Material Adverse
Change, or of any change  in any representation or warranty provided by
Solana in this Agreement which  change is or may be of such a nature to
render any representation or warranty  misleading or untrue in any material
respect and Solana shall in good faith  discuss with Gran Tierra any change
in circumstances (actual, anticipated,  contemplated, or to the knowledge of
Solana, threatened) which is of such a  nature that there may be a reasonable
question as to whether notice need to  be  given to Gran Tierra pursuant to
this provision;

 

 

**w.** Ensure  that it has available funds under its lines of credit or other
bank facilities  to permit the payment of the maximum amount which may be
required by Section  7.4  having regard to its other liabilities and
obligations, and shall take all  such  actions as may be necessary to ensure
that it maintains such availability to  ensure that it is able to pay such
amount when required;

 

 

**x.** Except  as  disclosed in the Solana Disclosure Letter, use its
reasonable commercial efforts  to obtain the consent of its bankers (if
required) and any other third party  consents required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and provide the  same  to Gran Tierra on or prior to the
Effective Date;

from  a  financial point of view, to Solana Securityholders; provided
that,  notwithstanding the covenants of Solana in this subsection, prior to
the  completion of the Arrangement, the Solana Board of Directors may
withdraw,  modify or change the recommendation regarding the Arrangement if,
in the opinion  of the Solana Board of Directors acting reasonably, having
received the advice  of its outside legal counsel which is reflected in
minutes of the meeting of  the  Solana Board of Directors, such withdrawal,
modification or change is necessary  for the Solana Board of Directors to
discharge its fiduciary duties under  applicable law and, if applicable,
provided the Solana Board of Directors shall  have complied with the
provisions of Subsections 5.2(r) and (s) and Section  7.4;

and agents of Gran  Tierra, as applicable, from and against any and all

61.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**7.4** **Termination  Fee** ****

 

 

**a.** If  this  Agreement is terminated by Solana pursuant to Section
7.1(b), then Gran Tierra  shall pay to Solana a cash termination fee equal to
Solana's transaction costs  (including the fees and costs of professional
advisors) incurred in connection  with negotiation and performance of the
Arrangement and related transactions,  subject to a maximum expense
reimbursement of $1.5 million, at the time of  such  termination.

 

 

**b.** If  this  Agreement is terminated by Gran Tierra pursuant to Section
7.1(c), then Solana  shall pay to Gran Tierra a cash termination fee equal to
the Gran Tierra's  transaction costs (including the fees and costs of
professional advisors)  incurred in connection with negotiation and
performance of the Arrangement  and  related transactions, subject to a
maximum expense reimbursement of $1.5  million, at the time of such
termination.

 

 

**c.** If  this  Agreement is terminated (x) by Solana pursuant to Section
7.1(i), or (y) by  Gran  Tierra pursuant to Section 7.1(h), **** then 
Solana shall pay to Gran Tierra a cash termination fee of $21 million,
payable  immediately upon written notice of termination of this Agreement
being  provided.

 

 

**d.** If  this  Agreement is terminated by Solana pursuant to Section
7.1(g), then Gran Tierra  shall pay to Solana a cash termination fee of $21
million, payable immediately  upon written notice of termination of this
Agreement being provided. 

 

 

**e.**   Gran  Tierra and Solana each agree that the agreements contained in
Sections 7.4(a)  through 7.4(d) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. If either party fails to promptly pay the
other party any fee due  under such Sections 7.4(a) through 7.4(d), it shall
pay the other party's costs  and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
in connection with any action,  including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken to collect  payment, together with interest on the amount
of any unpaid fee at the publicly  announced prime rate of Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce from the date such  fee was first due.

 

 

Each  of  the Parties acknowledges and agrees that all of the payment
amounts set out  in  this Article 7 are payments of liquidated damages which
are a genuine  pre-estimate of the damages that the other party will suffer
or incur as a  result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant
termination of  this Agreement and are not penalties. Each party irrevocably
waives any right  it  may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive  or  punitive. For greater certainty, each
of the parties agrees that the payment  of  the applicable amount pursuant
to Sections 7.4(a), (b), (c) or (d) is the sole  monetary remedy of each
party under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall  preclude a party from
seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or  threatened breach of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement  or  the Confidentiality
Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of  any  of such act,
covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond  or  security
in connection therewith. For clarity, if a party is required to pay  a 
termination fee pursuant to subsections (c) or (d) of Section 7.4 above, no 
party shall be obligated to pay more than $21 million (and any additional 
amounts required under Section 7.4(e)) pursuant to this Article 7.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  8** 

 

 

**ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS**

 

 

Gran  Tierra and Solana each agree to take the following actions after the
execution  of this Agreement.

 

 

**8.1** **Meetings**

 

 

Solana  and Gran Tierra shall each duly call a meeting of its securityholders
entitled  to vote to be held within 20 business days of the filing of the
definitive  Joint  Proxy Statement with the SEC for the purpose of (a) in
the case of Solana,  voting upon the Plan of Arrangement and the transactions
contemplated hereby  and  thereby, and (b) in the case of Gran Tierra,
voting upon a proposal to  approve the issuance of such number of shares of
Gran Tierra Common Stock as  are  necessary to consummate the Arrangement
including those issuable on the exchange  of the Exchangeable Shares, and
each shall, through its board of directors,  recommend to its securityholders
in the Joint Proxy Statement approval of such  matters and shall coordinate
and cooperate with respect to the timing of such  meetings. Each party may
only change such recommendation in the event that  the  board of directors
of such party concludes, in good faith, after receiving  the  written advice
of outside counsel that such action is necessary for the board  of 
directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty. The
meetings  of  securityholders of Solana and Gran Tierra will be called for

Tierra Stockholders  Meeting prior to the commencement of the Solana
Securityholders  Meeting.

execute and  deliver a Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement containing
substantially the  same  terms and conditions set forth in **Exhibit  C**
,  together with such other terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the
parties  hereto acting reasonably.

 

 

**c.** On  or  before the Effective Date, Gran Tierra will reserve for
issuance such number  of  shares of Gran Tierra Common Stock as shall be
necessary to give effect to  the  exchanges and assumptions or exchanges of
Solana Options and Solana Warrants  contemplated hereby.

 

 

**8.4** **Indemnification  and Related Matters**

 

 

**a.** Gran  Tierra agrees that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of the  present or former directors and officers of Solana (as such) or
any of the  Solana Subsidiaries or present or former directors and officers
(as such) of  Solana or any of the Solana Subsidiaries serving or who served
at Solana's or  any of the Solana Subsidiaries' request as a director,
officer, employee, agent  or representative of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust,  employee benefit plan or other enterprise
(each such present or former director  or officer of Solana or any of the
Solana Subsidiaries, an " ** _Indemnified  Party_** "),  as  provided by
contract or in Solana's charter or bylaws or similar documents of  any of the
Solana Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof (copies of all  of 
which have been provided to Gran Tierra) with respect to matters occurring 
prior  to the Effective Time, shall survive and shall continue in full force
and effect  and without modification for a period of not less than the
statutes of  limitations applicable to such matters.

 

 

**b.** From  and  after the Effective Time, Gran Tierra shall cause Solana
to indemnify and hold  harmless to the fullest extent permitted under the
ABCA, each Indemnified Party  against any costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees),  judgments, fines, losses, claims and damages
and liabilities, and amounts paid  in settlement thereof with the consent of
the indemnifying party, such consent  not to be unreasonably withheld, in
connection with any actual or threatened  claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that is based on, or arises  out  of, the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of Solana or  any  Solana Subsidiary
(including without limitation with respect to any of the  transactions
contemplated hereby or the Arrangement) or who is serving or who  served at
Solana's or any of the Solana Subsidiaries' request as a director,  officer,
employee, agent or representative of another corporation, partnership,  joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. In the event  of 
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, Gran Tierra shall 
cause Solana to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in advance 
of  the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or 
investigation to the fullest extent permitted by law subject to the
limitations  imposed by the ABCA. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such  claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought
against any  Indemnified Parties, (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel  reasonably satisfactory to Gran Tierra and, subject to limitations
imposed  by  the ABCA, Solana shall (or Gran Tierra shall cause Solana to)
pay all reasonable  fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as  statements therefor are received; and (ii) Gran Tierra
will use all  reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of such matter;
provided, however,  that neither Solana nor Gran Tierra shall be liable for
any settlement effected  without its prior written consent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 8.4(b),  upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation,  shall notify Gran Tierra (but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve a  party  from any liability which it
may have under this Section 8.4 (b) unless such  failure results in actual
prejudice to such party and then only to the extent  of  such prejudice).
The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law  firm  in any
jurisdiction to represent them with respect to each such matter unless  such
counsel determines that there is, under applicable standards of  professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions  of any
two or more Indemnified Parties, in which event additional counsel may  be 
required to be retained by the Indemnified Parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**c.** Subject  to limitations imposed by the ABCA, provided the Arrangement
becomes effective,  Solana shall (or Gran Tierra shall cause Solana to) pay
all expenses, including  reasonable attorney's fees, as the same may be
incurred by any Indemnified  Parties in any action by any Indemnified Party
or parties seeking to enforce  the  indemnity or other obligations provided
for in this Section 8.4; provided,  however, that Solana will be entitled to
reimbursement for any advances made  under this Section 8.4 to any
Indemnified Party who ultimately proves  unsuccessful in enforcing the
indemnity as finally determined by a  non-appealable judgment in a court of
competent jurisdiction, and payment of  such expenses in advance of the final
disposition of the action shall be made  only upon receipt of any undertaking
by the Indemnified Party to reimburse  all  amounts advanced if such action
ultimately proves unsuccessful.

 

 

**d.** Provided  the Arrangement becomes effective, for a period of five (5)
years after the  Effective Date, Gran Tierra shall continue in effect
director and officer  liability insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties in such amounts,  and with such deductibles, retained amounts,
coverages and exclusions as Solana  provides for its own directors and
officers at the date hereof.

 

 

**e.** This  Section 8.4, which shall survive the consummation of this
Agreement and the  Arrangement, is intended to benefit each person or entity
indemnified  hereunder.

Exchangeable Shares in consideration  for the  grant by the Eligible
Shareholder to ExchangeCo and Callco  of certain  rights and benefits as
against the Eligible Shareholder in  respect of the  Exchangeable Shares. To
the extent that the value of the ancillary  rights  and benefits received by
the Eligible Shareholder exceeds the  value of the  rights and benefits

Eligible Shareholder shall be considered to have  disposed of a  portion of
its Target Shares in consideration for such excess  ancillary  rights and
benefits, and to have disposed of the remaining  portion (the  " **share 
portion** ")  of its Target Shares solely in consideration for Exchangeable 
Shares. The  share portion (expressed as a number) shall be equal to the 
number of  Target Shares obtained when the total number of Target Shares 
transferred  by the Eligible Shareholder to ExchangeCo is multiplied by  the
aggregate  fair market value of the Exchangeable Shares received by the 
Eligible  Shareholder divided by the sum of such aggregate fair market 
value and the  amount, if any, by which the aggregate fair market value of 
the ancillary  rights and benefits received by the Eligible Shareholder
exceeds  the  aggregate fair market value of the rights and benefits
granted  by the  Eligible Shareholder to ExchangeCo and Callco in respect
of  the  Exchangeable Shares.

agreed  amounts for  the purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to
the  election forms  complying with the provisions of the Tax Act (and any
applicable  provincial legislation), the forms will be signed by ExchangeCo 
and  returned to such holders of Target Shares for filing with the  Canada 
Revenue Agency (and any applicable provincial taxation  authority).

**ARTICLE 4**

 

**DISSENTING  SHAREHOLDERS**

 

 

        

4.1

    |  

Each  registered holder of Target Shares shall have the right to  dissent
with  respect to the Arrangement in accordance with the Interim Order.  A 
Dissenting Securityholder shall, at the Effective Time, cease  to have any 
rights as a holder of Target Shares and shall only be entitled  to be paid 
the fair value of the holder\'s Target Shares by Acquiror. A  Dissenting 
Securityholder who is paid the fair value of the holder\'s Target  Shares 
shall be deemed to have transferred the holder\'s Target Shares  to 
Acquiror, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of  the ABCA. A 
Dissenting Securityholder who for any reason is not entitled  to be paid 
the fair value of the holder\'s Target Shares shall be treated  as if the 
holder had participated in the Arrangement on the same basis  as a  non-
dissenting holder of Target Shares notwithstanding the  provisions of 
Section 191 of the ABCA. The fair value of the Target Shares shall  be 
determined as of the close of business on the last Business  Day before the 
day on which the Arrangement is approved by the holders of  Target Shares 
at the Meeting; but in no event shall Acquiror or Target be  required to 
recognize such Dissenting Shareholder as a securityholder of  Acquiror, 
Target or ExchangeCo after the Effective Time and the name  of such holder 
shall be removed from the applicable register as at the Effective  Time. 
For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions  in  section
191 of the ABCA, no Person who has voted in favour of the  Arrangement shall
be entitled to dissent with respect to the  Arrangement.  In addition, a
Target Shareholder may only exercise dissent  rights in  respect of all, and
not less than all, of its Target  Shares.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

**ARTICLE 5**

 

**OUTSTANDING  CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SECURITIES**

 

 

        

5.1

    |  

From  and after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing 
Target  Securities that were exchanged under Section 3.1  shall represent
only the right to receive the consideration  to which the  holders are
entitled under the Arrangement, or as to those  held by  Dissenting
Securityholders, other than those Dissenting Securityholders  deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement pursuant to  Section  3.1,  to receive the
fair value of the Target Shares represented  by such  certificates.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

5.2

    |  

Subject  to the provisions of the Letter of Transmittal, Acquiror shall,  as
soon as  practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the  date
of  deposit by a former Target Shareholder of a duly completed  Letter of 
Transmittal and the certificates representing such Target Shares,  either:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

forward  or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid)  to
such  former holder at the address specified in the Letter of Transmittal; 
or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

if  requested by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal, make  available
or  cause to be made available at the Depositary for pickup by  such 
holder,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

certificates  representing the number of Exchangeable Shares and/or Acquiror
Shares  issued to  such holder under the Arrangement.

 

 

        

5.3

    |  

If  any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time 
represented  an interest in outstanding Target Shares that were exchanged 
pursuant to  Section 3.1  has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit  of  that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to have been  lost,  stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will
issue and deliver  in exchange for  such lost stolen or destroyed
certificate the consideration  to which the  holder is entitled pursuant to
the Arrangement (and any dividends  or  distributions with respect thereto)
as determined in accordance  with the  Arrangement. The Person who is
entitled to receive such consideration  shall, as a condition precedent to
the receipt thereof, give  a bond to  each of Target and Acquiror and their
respective transfer agents,  which  bond is in form and substance
satisfactory to each of the Target  and  Acquiror and their respective
transfer agents, or shall, to  the extent  agreed by Acquiror and Target,
otherwise indemnify Target and  Acquiror and  their respective transfer
agents against any claim that may  be made  against any of them with respect
to the certificate alleged  to have been  lost, stolen or destroyed.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

5.4

    |  

All  dividends or other distributions, if any, made with respect  to any
Target  Shares allotted and issued pursuant to this Arrangement but  for
which a  certificate has not been issued shall be paid or delivered  to
the  Depositary to be held by the Depositary, in trust, for the 
registered  holder thereof. Subject to Section 5.5,  the Depositary shall
pay and deliver to any such registered  holder, as  soon as reasonably
practicable after application therefor is  made by the  registered holder to
the Depositary in such form as the Depositary  may  reasonably require, such
dividends and distributions to which  such holder  is entitled, net of
applicable withholding and other  taxes.

    
---|--- 
    

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

        

5.5

    |  

Any  certificate formerly representing Target Shares that is not  deposited
with  all other documents as required by this Plan of Arrangement  on or
before  the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to 
represent a  right or claim of any kind or nature including the right of 
the holder of  such shares to receive Exchangeable Shares (and any dividend 
and  distributions thereon), Acquiror Shares (and any dividend and 
distributions thereon) and/or Cash Consideration, as applicable.  In such 
case, such Exchangeable Shares (and any dividend and distributions  thereon),
Acquiror Shares (together with all dividends and  distributions  thereon)
and Cash Consideration shall be returned to ExchangeCo  or  Acquiror, as
applicable, and such Exchangeable Shares and Acquiror  Shares  shall be
cancelled.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

5.6

    |  

No  certificates representing fractional Exchangeable Shares, Acquiror 
Shares  or Target Shares shall be issued under this Arrangement. In  lieu of
any  fractional shares: (a) each registered holder of Target Shares 
otherwise  entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share  or
Acquiror  Share will receive the nearest whole number of Exchangeable 
Shares or  Acquiror Shares, respectively (with fractions equal to exactly 
0.5 being  rounded up); (b) each registered holder of Target Options
otherwise  entitled to a fractional interest in a Target Share will receive 
the  nearest whole number of Target Shares (with all fractions being 
rounded  down); and (c) each registered holder of Target Warrants otherwise 
entitled to a fractional interest in a Target Share will receive  the 
nearest whole number of Target Shares (with fractions equal  to exactly 0.5 
being rounded up).

**ARTICLE 6**

 

**AMENDMENTS**

 

 

        

6.1

    |  

Acquiror  or Target may amend this Plan of Arrangement at any time and  from
time to  time prior to the Effective Time, provided that each such
amendment  must  be: (i) set out in writing; (ii) approved by the other
party;  (iii) filed  with the Court and, if made following the Meeting,
approved  by the Court;  and (iv) communicated to holders of Target
Securities, if and  as required  by the Court.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

6.2

    |  

Any  amendment to this Plan of Arrangement may be proposed by Acquiror  or 
Target at any time prior to or at the Meeting (provided that  the other 
party shall have consented thereto) with or without any other  prior notice 
or communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the Target  Shareholders
voting at the Meeting (other than as may be required  under  the Interim
Order), shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement  for all  purposes.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

6.3

    |  

Acquiror  and Target may amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan of 
Arrangement at  any time and from time to time after the Meeting and prior 
to the  Effective Time with the approval of the  Court.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

6.4

    |  

Any  amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement  may
be  made prior to or following the Effective Time by Acquiror and  Target; 
provided that, it concerns a matter which, in the reasonable  opinion of 
Acquiror and Target, is of an administrative nature required  to better 
give effect to the implementation of this Plan of Arrangement  and is not 
adverse to the financial or economic interests of any former  holder of 
Target Shares.

**ARTICLE 7**

 

**WITHHOLDING  RIGHTS**

 

 

        

7.1

    |  

Acquiror,  Target, Callco and ExchangeCo and the Depositary shall be
entitled  to  deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable 
to any Target  Securityholders or holders of Exchangeable Shares such
amounts  as  Acquiror, Target, Callco and ExchangeCo or the Depositary
determines,  acting reasonably, are required or permitted pursuant to the 
Tax Act, the  _United  States Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ ,  or any
provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state,  local or  foreign tax
law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that  amounts are  so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all  purposes  hereof as having
been paid to the Target Securityholder in  respect of  which such deduction
and withholding was made; provided that,  such  withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing  authority.

**CERTAIN  RIGHTS OF ACQUIROR TO ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES**

 

 

        

8.1

    |  

**Change  of Law Call Right**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Acquiror  shall have the overriding right (the " **Change  of Law Call
Right** "),  in the event of a Change of Law, to purchase (or to cause
Callco  to  purchase) from all but not less than all of the holders of 
Exchangeable  Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which  is
an affiliate  of Acquiror) all but not less than all of the Exchangeable 
Shares held by  each such holder upon payment by Acquiror or Callco, as the 
case may be,  of an amount per share (the " **Change  of Law Call Purchase
Price** ")  equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable on the last 
Business Day  prior to the Change of Law Call Date, in accordance with
Subsection  8.1(c).  In the event of the exercise of the Change of Law Call
Right  by Acquiror  or Callco, as the case may be, each holder of
Exchangeable  Shares shall be  obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares
held by such  holder to  Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, on the
Change of Law  Call Date  upon payment by Acquiror to such holder of the
Change of Law  Call Purchase  Price for each such Exchangeable  Share.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

To  exercise the Change of Law Call Right, Acquiror or Callco must  notify
the  Transfer Agent of its intention to exercise such right at least  45
days  before the date on which Acquiror or Callco intends to acquire  the 
Exchangeable Shares (the " **Change  of Law Call Date** ").  If Acquiror or
Callco exercises the Change of Law Call Right,  then, on the  Change of Law
Call Date, Acquiror or Callco, as the case may  be, will  purchase and the
holders of Exchangeable Shares will sell all  of the  Exchangeable Shares
then outstanding for a price per share  equal to the  Change of Law Call
Purchase Price.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

For  the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable  Shares 
pursuant to the exercise of the Change of Law Call Right, Acquiror  or 
Callco, as the case may be, shall deposit or cause to be deposited  with 
the Transfer Agent, on or before the Change of Law Call Date,  the 
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total Change  of Law Call 
Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share Consideration  has 
been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after the  Change of Law 
Call Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease  to be holders 
of the Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise  any of 
the rights of holders in respect thereof (including any rights  under the 
Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement), other than the right  to receive 
their proportionate part of the total Change of Law Purchase  Price payable 
by Acquiror or Callco, as the case may be, without interest,  upon 
presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing  the 
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall  on and after 
the Change of Law Call Date be considered and deemed for all  purposes to 
be the holder of Acquiror Shares to which such holder is entitled.  Upon 
surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates 
representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other  documents and 
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable  Shares 
under the ABCA and the by-laws of ExchangeCo and such additional  documents 
and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require,  the holder 
of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled  to 
receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf  of Acquiror 
or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver to such holder,  the 
Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such holder is  entitled.

    |  

**Callco  Liquidation Call Right**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Callco  shall have the overriding right (the " **Liquidation  Call Right**
"),  in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, 
dissolution  or winding-up of ExchangeCo or any other distribution of the 
assets of  ExchangeCo among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up 
its  affairs, pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, 
to  purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable 
Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which  is an affiliate 
of Acquiror) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than  all of the 
Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder upon payment by  Callco to 
each such holder of the Exchangeable Share Price applicable  on the last 
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date (the " **Liquidation  Call
Purchase Price** ")  in accordance with Subsection 8.2(c).  In the event of
the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right  by Callco, each  holder shall be
obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares  held by such  holder to
Callco on the Liquidation Date upon payment by Callco  to such  holder of
the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such  Exchangeable  Share,
whereupon Canco shall have no obligation to pay any  Liquidation  Amount to
the holders of such shares so purchased by  Callco.

         |  

(b)

    |  

To  exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify ExchangeCo  and
the  Transfer Agent of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right  at least
45  days before the Liquidation Date, in the case of a voluntary 
liquidation,  dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo or any other
voluntary  distribution of the assets of ExchangeCo among its shareholders 
for the  purpose of winding-up its affairs, and at least five Business  Days
before  the Liquidation Date, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, 
dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo or any other involuntary 
distribution of the assets of ExchangeCo among its shareholders  for the 
purpose of winding up its affairs. The Transfer Agent will  notify the 
holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether Callco has exercised  the 
Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period  during 
which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises  the 
Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Callco  will purchase 
and the holders of Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the  Exchangeable 
Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the  Liquidation 
Call Purchase Price.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

For  the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable  Shares 
pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit  or cause to 
be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation  Date, 
the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing the total  Liquidation 
Call Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable Share  Consideration 
has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after  the 
Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall  cease to be 
holders of the Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled  to exercise 
any of the rights of holders in respect thereof (including  any rights 
under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement ), other than  the right to 
receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call  Purchase 
Price payable by Callco, without interest, upon presentation  and surrender 
by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable  Shares held by 
such holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation  Date be 
considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of  Acquiror Shares 
to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer  Agent of 
a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares,  together 
with such other documents and instruments as may be required  to effect a 
transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the ABCA and the by-laws  of 
ExchangeCo and such additional documents and instruments as  the Transfer 
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered  certificate 
or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,  and the 
Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder,  the 
Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such holder is entitled.  If 
Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the  manner 
described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the  Exchangeable 
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the  Liquidation 
Amount otherwise payable by ExchangeCo in connection with the  liquidation, 
dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo pursuant to Article  5 of the 
Exchangeable Share Provisions.

**Callco  Redemption Call Right**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

In  addition to Callco\'s rights contained in the Exchangeable Share
Provisions,  including the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the
Exchangeable Share  Provisions), Callco shall have the following rights in
respect of the  Exchangeable Shares:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Callco  shall have the overriding right (the " **Redemption  Call Right**
"),  in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed redemption  of the 
Exchangeable Shares by ExchangeCo pursuant to Article 7 of  the 
Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not  less than all 
of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder  of 
Exchangeable Shares which is an affiliate of Acquiror) on the  Redemption 
Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held  by each 
such holder upon payment by Callco to each such holder of the  Exchangeable 
Share Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the  Redemption 
Date (the " **Redemption  Call Purchase Price** ")  in accordance with
Subsection 8.3(c).  In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right
by  Callco, each  holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell
all  the  Exchangeable Shares held by such holder to Callco on the
Redemption  Date  upon payment by Callco to such holder of the Redemption
Call  Purchase  Price for each such Exchangeable Share, whereupon Canco
shall  have no  obligation to redeem, or to pay the Redemption Price in
respect  of, such  shares so purchased by Callco.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

To  exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the  Transfer
Agent  of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right at least 60 days 
before the  Redemption Date, except in the case of a redemption occurring 
as a result  of an Acquiror Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share
Voting  Event or  an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event (each as
defined  in the  Exchangeable Share Provisions), in which case Callco
shall  so notify the  Transfer Agent and Canco on or before the Redemption
Date.  The Transfer  Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares as  to whether  Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right
forthwith after  the expiry  of the period during which the same may be
exercised by Callco.  If Callco  exercises the Redemption Call Right, then,
on the Redemption  Date, Callco  will purchase and the holders of
Exchangeable Shares will sell  all of the  Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding for a price per share  equal to the  Redemption Call Purchase
Price.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(c)

    |  

For  the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable  Shares 
pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Call Right, Callco  shall 
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on  or before the 
Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration representing  the 
total Redemption Call Purchase Price. Provided that such Exchangeable  Share
Consideration has been so deposited with the Transfer  Agent, on and  after
the Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares  shall  cease to
be holders of the Exchangeable Shares and shall not  be entitled  to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof  (including any 
rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement), other  than the 
right to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption  Call 
Purchase Price payable by Callco, without interest, upon presentation  and 
surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable  Shares
held by such holder and the holder shall on and after  the  Redemption Date
be considered and deemed for all purposes to  be the holder  of Acquiror
Shares to which such holder is entitled. Upon surrender  to the  Transfer
Agent of a certificate or certificates representing  Exchangeable  Shares,
together with such other documents and instruments  as may be  required to
effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under  the ABCA and  the by-laws of
ExchangeCo and such additional documents and  instruments as  the Transfer
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such  surrendered  certificate
or certificates shall be entitled to receive in  exchange  therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall  deliver to such  holder, the
Exchangeable Share Consideration to which such  holder is  entitled. If
Callco does not exercise the Redemption Call Right  in the  manner described
above, on the Redemption Date the holders  of the  Exchangeable Shares will
be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the  Redemption Price otherwise
payable by ExchangeCo in connection  with the  redemption of the
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7  of the  Exchangeable Share
Provisions.

share dividend on each Acquiror  Share. In  making such Subdivision, the
Board of Directors shall consider  the effect  thereof upon the then

contemplated  by Subsection 3.1(a)  and the sending of such a cheque to each

represented thereby unless  the cheque is  not paid on presentation. Subject
to applicable law, certificates  registered in the name of the registered
holder of Exchangeable  Shares  shall be issued or transferred in respect of
any stock dividends  contemplated by Subsection 3.1(b)  or  any Subdivision
contemplated by Section 3.2  and the sending of such a certificate to each
holder of an  Exchangeable  Share shall satisfy the stock dividend
represented thereby.  Such other  type and amount of property in respect of
any dividends contemplated  by  Subsection 3.1(c)  shall be issued,
distributed or transferred by the Corporation  in such  manner as it shall
determine and the issuance, distribution  or transfer  thereof by the
Corporation to each holder of an Exchangeable  Share shall  satisfy the
dividend represented thereby. No holder of an  Exchangeable  Share shall be
entitled to recover by action or other legal  process  against the
Corporation any dividend that is represented  by a cheque that  has not been
duly presented to the Corporation\'s bankers  for payment or  that otherwise
remains unclaimed for a period of six years  from the date  on which such
dividend was first  payable.

corresponding dividend declared on the Acquiror Shares.  The record  date

receive Exchangeable Shares in connection with any Subdivision  of the 
Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.2  and the effective date of such
Subdivision shall be the same  dates as the  record date and payment date,

Shares.

**3.5**

    |  

If  on any payment date for any dividends declared on the Exchangeable 
Shares  under Section 3.1  the dividends are not paid in full on all of the
Exchangeable  Shares then  outstanding, any such dividends that remain
unpaid shall  be paid on the  earliest subsequent date or dates determined
by the Board  of Directors on  which the Corporation shall have sufficient
moneys, assets  or property  properly applicable to the payment of such 
dividends.

States (except for any differing consequences arising as  a result of 
differing marginal taxation rates and with regard to the  individual 
circumstances of holders of Exchangeable  Shares).

by Callco pursuant to the Retraction Call  Right, the  Redemption Call Right
or the Liquidation Call Right or by  the Acquiror  pursuant to the Exchange
Right or the Automatic Exchange  Right, the holder  of the Exchangeable
Share shall cease to have any right to  be paid any  amount by the
Corporation in respect of any unpaid dividends  on such  Exchangeable
Shares.

Exchangeable Shares corresponding  to dividends declared and paid to date on
the Acquiror Shares shall  have been  declared and paid on the Exchangeable
Shares.

 

 

**ARTICLE  5**

 

 

**DISTRIBUTION  ON LIQUIDATION**

 

 

        

**5.1**

    |  

In  the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of  the
Corporation  or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation 
among its  shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a  holder
of  Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable  law and
to  the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, to  receive from
the  assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable  Share held
by  such holder on the effective date (the " **Liquidation  Date** ")  of
such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or distribution  of assets, 
before any distribution of any part of the assets of the  Corporation among 
the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking  junior to the 
Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable  Share 
Price applicable on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation  Date 
(the " **Liquidation  Amount** ").

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**5.2**

    |  

On  or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the  exercise
by  Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation shall  cause to
be  delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation 
Amount  for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender  of
the  certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together  with
such  other documents and instruments as may be required to effect  a
transfer of  Exchangeable Shares under the ABCA and the articles and by-
laws  of the  Corporation and such additional documents and instruments  as
the Transfer  Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require at the
registered  office  of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer
Agent  as may be  specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of 
the Exchangeable  Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such 
Exchangeable  Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the
address  of the  holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for
the  Exchangeable  Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the
registered  office of  the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer
Agent as  may be specified  by the Corporation by notice to the holders of
Exchangeable  Shares, on  behalf of the Corporation of the Exchangeable
Share Consideration  representing the total Liquidation Amount. On and after
the  Liquidation  Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease 
to be holders of  such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise  any of the  rights of holders in respect thereof (including any
rights  under the  Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement) other than the
right  to receive their  proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount,
unless  payment of the  total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable
Shares shall  not be made  upon presentation and surrender of share
certificates in  accordance with  the foregoing provisions, in which case
the rights of the  holders shall  remain unaffected until the total
Liquidation Amount to which  such holders  are entitled shall have been paid
to such holders in the  manner  hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall
have the right  at any time on  or before the Liquidation Date to deposit or
cause to be  deposited the  Exchangeable Share Consideration in respect of
the Exchangeable  Shares  represented by certificates that have not at the
Liquidation  Date been  surrendered by the holders thereof in a custodial
account  with any  chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such
deposit  being made,  the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
after such  deposit,  shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part
of  the total  Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares so
deposited,  against  presentation and surrender of the said certificates
held  by them,  respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. 
Upon such  payment or deposit of such Exchangeable Share Consideration,  the
holders  of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered  and
deemed for  all purposes to be holders of the Acquiror Shares delivered  to
them or the  custodian on their behalf.

After  the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the  holders of

pursuant  to Section 5.1,  such holders shall not be entitled to share in
any further  distribution of  the assets of the Corporation.

**ARTICLE  6**

 

 

**RETRACTION  OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER**

 

 

        

**6.1**

    |  

A  holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time,  subject
to  the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and otherwise 
upon  compliance with the provisions of this Article  6,  to require the
Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable  Shares  registered in
the name of such holder, for an amount per  share equal to  the Exchangeable
Share Price applicable on the last Business  Day prior to  the Retraction
Date (the " **Retraction  Price** "),  which shall be satisfied in full by
the Corporation causing  to be  delivered to such holder the Exchangeable
Share Consideration  representing  the Retraction Price. To effect such
redemption, the holder  shall present  and surrender at the registered
office of the Corporation  or at any office  of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation  by notice to  the holders of Exchangeable
Shares, the certificate or certificates  representing the Exchangeable Shares
which the holder desires  to have the  Corporation redeem, together with
such other documents and  instruments as  may be required to effect a
transfer of Exchangeable Shares  under the ABCA  and the articles and bylaws
of the Corporation and such additional  documents and instruments as the
Transfer Agent and the Corporation  may  reasonably require, and together
with a duly executed statement  (the  " **Retraction  Request** ")  in the
form of Schedule A hereto or in such other form as  may be  acceptable to
the Corporation:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

specifying  that the holder desires to have all or any number specified 
therein of the  Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or
certificates  (the  " **Retracted  Shares** ")  redeemed by the
Corporation;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

stating  the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the 
Corporation  redeem the Retracted Shares (the " **Retraction  Date** "), 
provided that the Retraction Date shall be not less than  10 Business Days 
nor more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the  Retraction 
Request is received by the Corporation and further provided  that in the 
event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder  in the 
Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall be deemed to  be the 15th 
Business Day after the date on which the Retraction Request  is received by 
the Corporation; and

-  10 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

         |  

(c)

    |  

acknowledging  the overriding right (the " **Retraction  Call Right** ") 
of Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted  Shares 
directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request  shall be deemed 
to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted  Shares to 
Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the  terms and 
conditions set out in Section 6.3.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**6.2**

    |  

Subject  to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right, upon 
receipt by  the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified 
in Section  6.1  of  a certificate or certificates representing the number
of  Retracted Shares,  together with a Retraction Request and such
additional documents  and  instruments as the Transfer Agent and the
Corporation may  reasonably  require, and provided that the Retraction
Request is not  revoked by the  holder in the manner specified in Section
6.7,  the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective  at the
close  of business on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be  delivered
to such  holder the total Retraction Price with respect to such shares  in 
accordance with Section 6.4.  If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by  any certificate  is redeemed (or purchased by Callco
pursuant to the Retraction  Call  Right), a new certificate for the balance
of such Exchangeable  Shares  shall be issued to the holder at the expense
of the  Corporation.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**6.3**

    |  

Upon  receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation 
shall  immediately notify Callco thereof and shall provide to Callco  a copy
of  the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the Retraction  Call
Right,  Callco must notify the Corporation of its determination to  do so
(the  " **Callco  Call Notice** ")  within five Business Days of
notification to Callco by the  Corporation of  the receipt by the
Corporation of the Retraction Request.  If Callco does  not so notify the
Corporation within such five Business Day  period, the  Corporation will
notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter  that  Callco will not
exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco  delivers the  Callco Call
Notice within such five Business Day period,  and provided that  the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the  manner  specified in
Section 6.7,  the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only  to
be an offer  by the holder to sell all but not less than all the Retracted 
Shares to  Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such 
event, the  Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco 
shall  purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Callco  on
the  Retraction Date all but not less than all the Retracted Shares  for a 
purchase price (the " **Purchase  Price** ")  per share equal to the
Retraction Price, which, as set forth  in Section  6.4,  shall be fully
paid and satisfied by the delivery by or on  behalf of  Callco, of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing  the total  Purchase Price.
For the purposes of completing a purchase  pursuant to the  Retraction Call
Right, Callco shall deposit with the Transfer  Agent, on or  before the
Retraction Date, the Exchangeable Share Consideration  representing the total
Purchase Price. Provided that Callco  has complied  with Section 6.4,  the
closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares  pursuant to  the
Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred  as at the close  of
business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty,  no  redemption
by the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall  take place on  the
Retraction Date. In the event that Callco does not deliver  a Callco  Call
Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided  that the 
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner  specified in 
Section 6.7,  the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the 
Retraction Date  and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 
6.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**6.4**

    |  

The  Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver  or cause
the  Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the  address of
the  holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for the 
Exchangeable  Shares or at the address specified in the holder\'s
Retraction  Request or,  if specified in such Retraction Request, by holding
for pick-up  by the  holder at the registered office of the Corporation or
at  any office of the  Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation
by  notice to such  holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Exchangeable Share
Consideration  representing the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase  Price, as  the case may be, and such delivery of such Exchangeable
Share  Consideration to the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be  payment of
and  shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction 
Price  or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent  that the
same  is represented by such Exchangeable Share  Consideration.

**6.5**

    |  

On  and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the  holder of
the  Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted  Shares
and  shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a  holder in
respect  thereof, other than the right to receive the total Retraction 
Price or  total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon
presentation  and  surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing  provisions,  payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase  Price, as the  case may be, shall not be made as provided in
Section 6.4,  in which case the rights of such holder shall remain
unaffected  until the  total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price,
as the  case may be,  has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On
and  after the close  of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation  and  surrender of certificates and payment of the total
Retraction  Price or the  total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been
made in  accordance with  the foregoing provisions, the holder of the
Retracted Shares  so redeemed  by the Corporation or purchased by Callco
shall thereafter  be considered  and deemed for all purposes to be the
holder of the Acquiror  Shares  delivered to it.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**6.6**

    |  

Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Article  6,  the Corporation
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted  Shares  specified by a holder in
a Retraction Request to the extent  that such  redemption of Retracted
Shares would be contrary to solvency  requirements  or other provisions of
applicable law. If the Corporation  believes, acting  reasonably, that on
any Retraction Date it would not be permitted  by any  of such provisions to
redeem the Retracted Shares tendered  for redemption  on such date, and
provided that Callco shall not have exercised  the  Retraction Call Right
with respect to the Retracted Shares,  the  Corporation shall only be
obligated to redeem Retracted Shares  specified  by a holder in a Retraction
Request to the extent of the  maximum number  that may be so redeemed
(rounded down to a whole number of  shares) as  would not be contrary to
such provisions and shall notify  the holder at  least two Business Days
prior to the Retraction Date as to  the number of  Retracted Shares which
will not be redeemed by the Corporation.  In any  case in which the
redemption by the Corporation of Retracted  Shares would  be contrary to
solvency requirements or other provisions  of applicable  law, the
Corporation shall redeem the maximum number of Exchangeable  Shares which the
Board of Directors determines the Corporation  is  permitted to redeem as of
the Retraction Date on a pro rata  basis and  shall issue to each holder of
Retracted Shares a new certificate,  at the  expense of the Corporation,
representing the Retracted Shares  not redeemed  by the Corporation pursuant
to Section 6.2.  Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the 
holder in the  manner specified in Section 6.7  and Callco does not exercise
the Retraction Call Right, the  holder of any  such Retracted Shares not
redeemed by the Corporation pursuant  to Section  6.2  as  a result of
solvency requirements or other provisions of  applicable law  shall be
deemed by giving the Retraction Request to have  instructed the  Trustee to
require Acquiror to purchase such, Retracted Shares  from such  holder on
the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter  on  payment by
Acquiror to such holder of the Retraction Price  for each such  Retracted
Share, all as more specifically provided in the  Voting and  Exchange Trust
Agreement.

**6.7**

    |  

A  holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given  by the
holder  to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business 
Day  immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction 
Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall be  null and void 
and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted  by the 
Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco  shall be deemed 
to have been revoked.

**Article  7**

 

 

**REDEMPTION  OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY THE** **CORPORATION**

 

 

        

**7.1**

    |  

Subject  to applicable law, and provided Callco has not exercised  the
Redemption  Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date  redeem
all but  not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares  for
an  amount per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable  on
the  last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (the " **Redemption 
Price** ").

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**7.2**

    |  

In  any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 
7,  the Corporation shall, at least 45 days before the Redemption  Date
(other  than a Redemption Date established in connection with an  Acquiror
Control  Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt 
Exchangeable  Share Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder 
of  Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption  by the 
Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption  Call Right, as 
the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such  holder. In the 
case of a Redemption Date established in connection with  an Acquiror 
Control Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or  an Exempt 
Exchangeable Share Voting Event, the written notice of redemption  by the 
Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption  Call Right will 
be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days  prior written 
notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors to  be reasonably 
practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such  notice shall set 
out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the  Redemption 
Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date  and, if 
applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right. In  the case of any 
notice given in connection with a possible Redemption Date,  such notice 
will be given contingently and will be withdrawn if the contingency  does 
not occur.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

**7.3**

    |  

On  or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise  by Callco of
the  Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be  delivered to
the  holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption  Price
for  each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender  at the 
registered office of the Corporation or at any office of  the Transfer 
Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in the notice  described in 
Section 7.2  of  the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares,
together  with such  other documents and instruments as may be required to
effect  a transfer of  Exchangeable Shares under the ABCA and the articles
and by-laws  of the  Corporation and such additional documents and
instruments  as the Transfer  Agent and the Corporation may reasonably
require. Payment  of the total  Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares shall be made  by delivery to  each holder, at the address of the
holder recorded in the  securities  register of the Corporation or by
holding for pick-up by  the holder at the  registered office of the
Corporation or at any office of  the Transfer  Agent as may be specified by
the Corporation in such notice,  on behalf of  the Corporation of the
Exchangeable Share Consideration representing  the  total Redemption Price.
On and after the Redemption Date,  the holders of  the Exchangeable Shares
called for redemption shall cease  to be holders of  such Exchangeable
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise  any of the  rights of holders
in respect thereof, other than the right  to receive  their proportionate
part of the total Redemption Price, unless  payment of  the total Redemption
Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall  not be made  upon presentation and
surrender of certificates in accordance  with the  foregoing provisions, in
which case the rights of the holders  shall remain  unaffected until the
total Redemption Price has been paid  in the manner  hereinbefore provided.
The Corporation shall have the right  at any time  after the sending of
notice of its intention to redeem the  Exchangeable  Shares as aforesaid to
deposit or cause to be deposited the  Exchangeable  Share Consideration with
respect to the Exchangeable Shares  so called for  redemption, or of such of
the said Exchangeable Shares represented  by  certificates that have not at
the date of such deposit been  surrendered by  the holders thereof in
connection with such redemption, in  a custodial  account with any chartered
bank or trust company in Canada  named in such  notice. Upon the later of
such deposit being made and the  Redemption Date,  the Exchangeable Shares
in respect whereof such deposit shall  have been  made shall be redeemed and
the rights of the holders thereof  after such  deposit or Redemption Date,
as the case may be, shall be  limited to  receiving their proportionate part
of the total Redemption  Price for such  Exchangeable Shares so deposited,
against presentation and  surrender of  the said certificates held by them,
respectively, in accordance  with the  foregoing provisions. Upon such
payment or deposit of such  Exchangeable  Share Consideration, the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares  shall  thereafter be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be  holders of  Acquiror Shares delivered to them or the
custodian on their  behalf.

**PURCHASE  FOR CANCELLATION**

Subject  to applicable law and the articles of the Corporation and

to time purchase  for  cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable
Shares by  private  agreement with any holder of Exchangeable  Shares.

Subject  to applicable law and the articles of the Corporation, the 
Corporation may  at any time and from time to time purchase for
cancellation  all or any  part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares by
tender to  all the holders  of record of Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding or through  the  facilities of any stock exchange on which the
Exchangeable  Shares are  listed or quoted at any price per share together
with an  amount equal to  all declared and unpaid dividends thereon for
which the record  date has  occurred prior to the date of purchase. If in
response to  an invitation  for tenders under the provisions of this Section
8.2,  more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price or prices  acceptable
to  the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared to purchase,  the 
Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall  be purchased 
as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares  tendered by 
each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided  that when 
shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall  be effected 
(disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares  tendered at the 
price at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation  is prepared 
to purchase after the Corporation has purchased all the shares  tendered at 
lower prices. If only part of the Exchangeable Shares represented  by any 
certificate shall be purchased, a new certificate for the  balance of such 
shares shall be issued at the expense of the  Corporation.

on such resolution by holders (other than Acquiror and its  Affiliates)

any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration 
otherwise payable to the holder, the Corporation, Callco,  Acquiror and the 
Transfer Agent are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise  dispose of such 
portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient  funds 
to the Corporation, Callco, Acquiror or the Transfer Agent,  as the case

Acquiror  covenants that if any Acquiror Common Shares (or other shares or
securities  into  which Acquiror Common Shares may be reclassified or
changed as contemplated  by  Section 2.7) (other than Acquiror Common Shares
held by the Trustee)  to be  issued and delivered hereunder (including for
greater certainty, pursuant  to the  Exchangeable Share Provisions, or
pursuant to the Change of Law Call  Right,  Exchange Right or the Automatic
Exchange Rights (all as defined in  the Voting  and Exchange Trust
Agreement)) require registration or qualification  with, or  approval of, or
the filing of any document, including any prospectus  or similar  document,
the taking of any proceeding with, or the obtaining of any  order,  ruling
or consent from, any governmental or regulatory authority under  any 
Canadian or United States federal, provincial, territorial or state 
securities  or other law or regulation or pursuant to the rules and
regulations  of any  securities or other regulatory authority, or the
fulfillment of any  other United  States or Canadian legal requirement
(collectively, the " **Applicable  Laws** ")  before  such shares (or other
shares or securities into which Acquiror Common  Shares may  be reclassified
or changed as contemplated by Section 2.7) may be issued  and  delivered by
Acquiror at the direction of ExchangeCo or Callco, if  applicable,  to the
holder of surrendered Exchangeable Shares or in order that such  shares  (or
other shares or securities into which Acquiror Common Shares may  be 
reclassified or changed as contemplated by Section 2.7) may be freely 
traded  thereafter (other than any restrictions of general application on
transfer  by  reason of a holder being a "control person" of Acquiror for
purposes  of Canadian  provincial securities law or an "affiliate" of
Acquiror for purposes  of United  States federal or state securities law),
Acquiror will use its reasonable  best  efforts and in good faith
expeditiously take all such actions and do  all such  things as are
necessary or desirable and within its power to cause  such Acquiror  Common
Shares (or other shares or securities into which Acquiror Common  Shares 
may be reclassified or changed as contemplated by Section 2.7) to be  and
remain  duly registered, qualified or approved under United States and/or
Canadian  law,  as the case may be, to the extent expressly provided in the
Arrangement  Agreement. Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts and in
good  faith  expeditiously take all such actions and do all such things as
are reasonably  necessary or desirable to cause all Acquiror Common Shares
(or other  shares or  securities into which Acquiror Common Shares may be
reclassified or  changed as  contemplated by Section 2.7) (other than
Acquiror Common Shares held  by the  Trustee) to be delivered hereunder to
be listed, quoted or posted for  trading on  all stock exchanges and
quotation systems on which outstanding Acquiror  Common  Shares (or other
shares or securities into which Acquiror Common Shares  may be  reclassified
or changed as contemplated by Section 2.7) are listed  and are  quoted or
posted for trading at such time.

contemplated by, and in accordance with, the Arrangement  Agreement.

Acquiror  will not without the prior approval of ExchangeCo and the  prior

referred to in Subsections 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) and each such  determination 
shall be conclusive and binding on Acquiror and the holders  of the 
Exchangeable Shares. In making each such determination, the  following 
factors shall, without excluding other factors determined  by the Board of 
Directors of ExchangeCo to be relevant, be considered by  the Board of 
Directors of ExchangeCo:

    |  

in  the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable  in

the  number of Acquiror Common Shares previously  outstanding;

         |

in  the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options  or 
warrants to subscribe for or purchase Acquiror Common Shares  (or 
securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying  rights to 
acquire Acquiror Common Shares), the relationship between  the exercise 
price of each such right, option or warrant and the Current  Market Price, 
the volatility of the Acquiror Common Shares and the term  of such 
instrument;

property  (including any shares or securities of Acquiror of any class 
other than  Acquiror Common Shares, any rights, options or warrants other 
than those  referred to in Subsection 2.7(d)(ii), any evidences of
indebtedness  of  Acquiror or any assets of Acquiror), the relationship
between  the fair  market value (as determined by the Board of Directors
of  ExchangeCo in the  manner above contemplated) of such property to be
issued  or distributed  with respect to each outstanding Acquiror Common
Share and  the Current  Market Price;

the  then  outstanding Acquiror Common Shares into a lesser number of 
Acquiror Common  Shares or any amalgamation, merger, reorganization or

in  all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the  relevant event
to  holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences 
may  differ from the taxation consequences to holders of Acquiror  Common
Shares  as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada  and the
United  States (except for any differing consequences arising as  a result
of  differing marginal taxation rates and without regard to the

taken such  steps as may be necessary for the purposes of ensuring that 
appropriate  dividends are paid or other distributions are made by
ExchangeCo,  or  subdivisions, redivisions or changes are made to the
Exchangeable  Shares,  in order to implement the required economic
equivalent with  respect to the  Acquiror Common Shares and Exchangeable

For  so  long as Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding (not including
Exchangeable  Shares held by Acquiror and its Affiliates), in the event that
a tender  offer,  share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid or similar
transaction  with  respect to Acquiror Common Shares (an " **Offer** ") 
is  proposed by Acquiror or is proposed to Acquiror or its shareholders  and
is  recommended by the Board of Directors of Acquiror, or is otherwise 
effected or  to be effected with the consent or approval of the Board of
Directors  of  Acquiror, and the Exchangeable Shares are not redeemed by
ExchangeCo  or  purchased by Callco pursuant to the Redemption Call Right,
Acquiror  will use its  reasonable best efforts expeditiously and in good
faith to take all  such actions  and do all such things as are necessary or
desirable to enable and  permit  holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than
Acquiror and its Affiliates)  to  participate in such offer to the same
extent and on an economically  equivalent  basis as the holders of Acquiror
Common Shares, without discrimination.  Without  limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Acquiror will use its reasonable  best  efforts expeditiously
and in good faith to ensure that holders of Exchangeable  Shares may
participate in each such offer without being required to  retract 
Exchangeable Shares as against ExchangeCo (or, if so required, to ensure 
that  any such retraction, shall be effective only upon, and shall be
conditional  upon, the closing of such Offer and only to the extent necessary
to  tender or  deposit to the Offer). Nothing herein shall affect the rights
of ExchangeCo  to  redeem (or Callco to purchase pursuant to the Redemption
Call Right)  Exchangeable Shares, as applicable, in the event of an Acquiror
Control  Transaction.

of the Exchangeable  Share Provisions, Acquiror covenants and agrees in
favour of ExchangeCo  that, as  long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares
are owned by any Person  other than  Acquiror or any of its Affiliates,
Acquiror will be and remain the  direct or  indirect beneficial owner of all
issued and outstanding voting shares  in the  capital of ExchangeCo and
Callco. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror  shall  not be in violation
of this Section 2.9 if any person or group of persons  acting  jointly or in
concert acquires all or substantially all of the assets  of  Acquiror or the
Acquiror Common Shares pursuant to any merger of Acquiror  pursuant to which
Acquiror was not the surviving corporation.

Acquiror  and Callco each covenants and agrees that it will not, and will
cause  its  Affiliates not to, exercise any voting rights which may be
exercisable  by  holders of Exchangeable Shares from time to time pursuant
to the Exchangeable  Share Provisions or pursuant to the provisions of the
ABCA (or any  successor or  other corporate statute by which ExchangeCo may
in the future be governed)  with  respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by

For  greater certainty, nothing contained in this Agreement, including the

of  Acquiror or ExchangeCo to make a "Rule 10b-18 purchase" of Acquiror 
Common  Shares pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the United States _Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934_ ,  as  amended, or any successor rule.

Acquiror  covenants and agrees in favour of ExchangeCo that, as long as any
outstanding  Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Acquiror
or  any of its  Affiliates, Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain  a listing  for such Exchangeable Shares on a Canadian stock
exchange which is  a designated  stock exchange within the meaning of the
_Income  Tax Act_ (Canada)  (the " **Tax  Act** ")  and to  ensure that
ExchangeCo remains a "public corporation" within the meaning  of the  Tax
Act and maintains a "substantial Canadian presence" within the  meaning of 
the Tax Act as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

sale,  lease or  otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its
undertaking, property  and  assets would become the property of any other
Person or, in the case  of a  merger, of the continuing corporation
resulting therefrom unless, but  may do so  if:

such  other Person or continuing corporation (the " **Acquiror  Successor**

provisions of this Agreement or, if not so bound, executes,  prior to or 
contemporaneously with the consummation of such transaction,  an agreement 
supplemental hereto and such other instruments (if any) as  are reasonably 
necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the  Acquiror 
Successor of liability for all moneys payable and property  deliverable 
hereunder and the covenant of such Acquiror Successor to  pay and deliver 
or cause to be delivered the same and its agreement to observe  and perform

thereupon the Acquiror  Successor  shall possess and from time to time may
exercise each and every right  and power  of Acquiror or Callco, as the case

ExchangeCo or  Callco) with or into Acquiror or the winding-up, liquidation
or dissolution  of  any wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror provided that

directed to the Beneficiaries  or  to the Trustee for the benefit of the
Beneficiaries by Acquiror) received  by the  Trustee from Acquiror, to the
extent possible, at the same time as  such  materials are sent to holders of
Acquiror Common Shares. The Trustee  will make  copies of all such materials
available for inspection by any Beneficiary  at the  Trustee\'s principal
office in Calgary, Alberta. Notwithstanding the  foregoing,  Acquiror at its
option may exercise the duties of the Trustee to deliver  copies  of all

the Exchange  Right. In  connection with each exercise of the Exchange
Right, Acquiror shall  provide to  the Trustee an Officer\'s Certificate

exercise of the Exchange Right  by the  Trustee, the Beneficiary shall
deliver to the Trustee, in person or  by certified  or registered mail, at
its principal office in Calgary, Alberta or  at such other  places as the
Trustee may from time to time designate by written notice  to the 
Beneficiaries, the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares  which
such  Beneficiary desires Acquiror to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for 
transfer,  and accompanied by such other documents and instruments as may be
required  to  effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the ABCA and
the by-laws  of  ExchangeCo and such additional documents and instruments as
the Trustee,  ExchangeCo and Acquiror may reasonably require together with:
(a) a  duly  completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right,
contained  on the  reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share
certificates, stating:  (i) that  the Beneficiary thereby instructs the
Trustee to exercise the Exchange  Right so  as to require Acquiror to
purchase from the Beneficiary the number  of  Exchangeable Shares specified
therein: (ii) that such Beneficiary has  good title  to and owns all such
Exchangeable Shares to be acquired by Acquiror  free and  clear of all
liens, claims, security interests and encumbrances; (iii)  the names  in
which the certificates representing Acquiror Common Shares issuable  in 
connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right are to be issued;  and

should be  delivered; and (b) payment (or evidence satisfactory to the
Trustee,  ExchangeCo  and Acquiror of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable
as contemplated  by  Section 5.8  of this  Agreement. If only a part of
the Exchangeable Shares represented by  any  certificate or certificates
delivered to the Trustee are to be purchased  by  Acquiror under the
Exchange Right, a new certificate for the balance  of such  Exchangeable
Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of  ExchangeCo.

5.8  or  evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to Acquiror, the
Trustee  shall  notify Acquiror and ExchangeCo of its receipt of the same,
which notice  to  Acquiror and ExchangeCo shall constitute exercise of the

such Exchangeable  Shares, and  Acquiror shall promptly thereafter deliver
or cause to be delivered  to the  Trustee, for delivery to the Beneficiary
in respect of such Exchangeable  Shares  (or to such other persons, if any,
properly designated by such Beneficiary)  the  Exchangeable Share
Consideration deliverable in connection with the  exercise of  the Exchange
Right; provided, however, that no such delivery shall  be made  unless and
until the Beneficiary requesting the same shall have paid  (or  provided
evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, ExchangeCo and Acquiror  of the 
payment of) the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.8  of
this  Agreement. Immediately upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to 
Acquiror and  ExchangeCo of the exercise of the Exchange Right, as provided
in this  Section 5.6,  the  closing of the transaction of purchase and
sale contemplated by the  Exchange  Right shall be deemed to have occurred,
and the Beneficiary of such  Exchangeable  Shares shall be deemed to have
transferred to Acquiror all of such  Beneficiary\'s  right, title and
interest in and to such Exchangeable Shares and in  the related  interest in
the Trust Estate and shall cease to be a holder of such  Exchangeable 
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a  holder
in  respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate  part
of the  total purchase price therefor, unless such Exchangeable Share
Consideration  is  not delivered by Acquiror to the Trustee for delivery to
such Beneficiary  (or to  such other person, if any, properly designated by
such Beneficiary)  within five  Business Days of the date of the giving of
such notice by the Trustee,  in which  case the rights of the Beneficiary
shall remain unaffected until such  Exchangeable Share Consideration is
delivered by Acquiror and any cheque  included therein is paid. Upon delivery
of such Exchangeable Share  Consideration  by Acquiror to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall deliver such Exchangeable  Share  Consideration to such
Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any,  properly  designated by such
Beneficiary). Concurrently with such Beneficiary  ceasing to  be a holder of
Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered  and  deemed for
all purposes to be the holder of the Acquiror Common Shares  delivered  to
it pursuant to the Exchange Right.

In  the  event that a Beneficiary has exercised its right under Article 6
of  the  Exchangeable Share Provisions to require ExchangeCo to redeem any
or  all of the  Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "
**Retracted  Shares** ")  and is  notified by ExchangeCo pursuant to
Section 6.6 of the Exchangeable  Share  Provisions that ExchangeCo will not
be permitted as a result of solvency  requirements of applicable law to
redeem all such Retracted Shares,  and provided  that Callco shall not have
exercised the Retraction Call Right with  respect to  the Retracted Shares
and that the Beneficiary has not revoked the retraction  request delivered by
the Beneficiary to ExchangeCo pursuant to Section  6.7 of  the Exchangeable
Share Provisions, and provided further that the Trustee  has  received
written notice of same from ExchangeCo or Acquiror, the retraction  request
will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from  the 
Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the 
Exchange  Right with respect to those Retracted Shares that ExchangeCo is
unable  to  redeem. In any such event, ExchangeCo hereby agrees with the
Trustee  and in  favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to
be forwarded  to the  Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the
Beneficiary to ExchangeCo  or to  the transfer agent of the Exchangeable
Shares (including a copy of  the  retraction request delivered pursuant to
Section 6.1 of the Exchangeable  Share  Provisions) in connection with such
proposed redemption of the Retracted  Shares  and the Trustee will thereupon
exercise the Exchange Right with respect  to the  Retracted Shares that
ExchangeCo is not permitted to redeem and will  require  Acquiror to
purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions  of this Article  5.

Event, the Trustee will mail to each Beneficiary,  at the  expense of

the rules and regulations of any regulatory  authority  or the fulfillment
of any other Canadian or United States federal,  provincial,  territorial or
state legal requirement before such shares may be issued  and  delivered by
Acquiror to the initial holder thereof or in order that  such shares  may be
freely traded thereafter (other than any restrictions of general  application
on transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person"  of  Acquiror for
purposes of Canadian provincial securities law or an "affiliate"  of 
Acquiror for purposes of United States federal or state securities  law), 
Acquiror will in good faith take all such actions and do all such things  as
are  necessary or desirable to cause such Acquiror Common Shares to be and 
remain  duly registered, qualified or approved under United States and/or
Canadian  law,  as the case may be, to the extent expressly provided in the

good  faith  expeditiously take all such actions and do all such things as
are reasonably  necessary or desirable to cause all Acquiror Common Shares to
be delivered  pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights
to  be listed,  quoted or posted for trading on all stock exchanges and
quotation systems  on  which outstanding Acquiror Common Shares are listed,
quoted or posted  for  trading at such time.

In  order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate  on a pro

of  assets of Acquiror in connection with a Liquidation Event, 
immediately  prior to the effective time (the " **Liquidation  Event
Effective Time** ")  of a Liquidation Event all of the then outstanding
Exchangeable  Shares  shall be automatically exchanged for Acquiror Common
Shares.  To effect  such automatic exchange, Acquiror shall purchase each
Exchangeable  Share  outstanding immediately prior to the Liquidation Event
Effective  Time and  held by Beneficiaries, and each Beneficiary shall sell
the  Exchangeable  Shares held by such Beneficiary at such time, for a
purchase  price per  share equal to the Exchangeable Share Price applicable
at  that time.  Acquiror shall provide the Trustee with an Officer\'s
Certificate  in  connection with any automatic exchange setting forth the 
calculation of  the Exchangeable Share Price for each Exchangeable  Share.

    |  

The  closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated  by the 
automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Acquiror Common  Shares shall 
be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the Liquidation  Event 
Effective Time, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have  transferred 
to Acquiror all of the Beneficiary\'s right, title and interest  in and to 
such Beneficiary\'s Exchangeable Shares and the related interest  in the 
Trust Estate. Any right of each such Beneficiary to receive  declared and 
unpaid dividends from ExchangeCo shall be deemed to be satisfied  and 
discharged and each such Beneficiary shall cease to be a  holder of such 
Exchangeable Shares and Acquiror shall deliver to the Beneficiary  the 
Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable upon the automatic  exchange 
of Exchangeable Shares. Concurrently with such Beneficiary  ceasing to be a 
holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered  and 
deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Acquiror  Common Shares 
issued pursuant to the automatic exchange of Exchangeable  Shares for 
Acquiror Common Shares and the certificates held by the Beneficiary 
previously representing the Exchangeable Shares exchanged  by the 
Beneficiary with Acquiror pursuant to such automatic exchange  shall 
thereafter be deemed to represent Acquiror Common Shares  issued to the 
Beneficiary by Acquiror pursuant to such automatic exchange.  Upon the 
request of a Beneficiary and the surrender by the Beneficiary  of 
Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent Acquiror  Common 
Shares, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by such instruments  of 
transfer as Acquiror may reasonably require, Acquiror shall  deliver or 
cause to be delivered to the Beneficiary certificates representing  Acquiror
Common Shares of which the Beneficiary is the  holder.

**Withholding  Rights**

Acquiror,  ExchangeCo and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold  from any  consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to
any holder  of  Exchangeable Shares or Acquiror Common Shares such amounts
as Acquiror,  ExchangeCo or the Trustee is required to deduct and withhold
with respect  to  such payment under the _Income  Tax Act_   (Canada), the
_United  States Internal Revenue Code of 1986_   or any  provision of
federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law,  in each case  as
amended or succeeded. The Trustee may act on the advice of counsel  with 
respect to such matters. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,  such 
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid  to
the  holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding  was  made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to  the  appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required  to be  deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash  portion of  the consideration otherwise payable to the
holder, Acquiror, ExchangeCo  and the  Trustee are hereby authorized to sell
or otherwise dispose of such  portion of  the consideration as is necessary
to provide sufficient funds to Acquiror,  ExchangeCo or the Trustee, as the
case may be, to enable it to comply  with such  deduction or withholding
requirement and Acquiror, ExchangeCo or the  Trustee  shall notify the
holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied  balance  of the net
proceeds of such sale.

Trustee\'s acceptance or administration of the Trust, its compliance  with
its  duties set forth in this Agreement, or any written or oral instruction 
delivered  to the Trustee by Acquiror or ExchangeCo pursuant hereto.

 

 

In  no  case shall Acquiror or ExchangeCo be liable under this indemnity
for  any claim  against any of the Indemnified Parties unless Acquiror and
ExchangeCo  shall be  notified by the Trustee of the written assertion of a
claim or of any  action  commenced against the Indemnified Parties, promptly
after any of the  Indemnified  Parties shall have received any such written
assertion of a claim or  shall have  been served with a summons or other

acceptable to Acquiror  or  ExchangeCo that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to  the Trustee  that are different from or in addition
to those available to Acquiror  or  ExchangeCo and that, in the judgment of
such counsel, would present  a conflict  of interest were a joint
representation to be undertaken (in which  case Acquiror  and ExchangeCo
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such  suit on  behalf of
the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees  and  expenses of
counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive  the  termination of
this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the  Trustee.

and such  successor  trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance,
shall become  vested with  all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of
its predecessor under  this  Agreement, with the like effect as if
originally named as trustee in  this  Agreement. However, on the written
request of Acquiror and ExchangeCo  or of the  successor trustee, the
trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of  any amounts  then due it
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, execute and  deliver an 
instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and  powers
of  the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon the request of any such successor 
trustee,  Acquiror, ExchangeCo and such predecessor trustee shall execute
any  and all  instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in
and  confirming to  such successor trustee all such rights and powers.

had occurred immediately prior to the Acquiror Control  Transaction and the
Acquiror Control Transaction was completed) without  any need  to amend the

**Exhibit  D**

 


 

**NONSOLICITATION  AGREEMENT**

 



 

**This  Nonsolicitation Agreement** **** is  being  executed and delivered
as of __________ ,  2008  by _______________ (the  " ** _Stockholder_**
")  in  favor of, and for the benefit of Gran Tierra Energy Inc., a Nevada 
corporation  (the " ** _Purchaser_** ")  and  Solana Resources Limited, an
Alberta corporation and its successors and  assigns (the " ** _Company_**
")  (as  hereinafter defined). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Nonsolicitation  Agreement are defined in Section 18.

 



 

**Recitals**

 



 

**A.** As  a  stockholder and employee of the Company, the Stockholder has
obtained  extensive  and valuable knowledge and confidential information
concerning the  businesses of  the Company and its subsidiaries. (The
Company and its subsidiaries  are referred  to collectively herein as the
"Acquired Companies.")

 



 

**B.** Pursuant  to a Arrangement Agreement dated as of July 28, 2008 among
the Purchaser,  the  Company, and Gran Tierra Exchangeco Inc. (the " **
_Arrangement  Agreement_** "),  the  Company's stockholders are selling all
of the outstanding stock of the Company  to the Purchaser contemporaneously
with the execution and delivery  of this  Nonsolicitation Agreement. As a
result of the Purchaser's acquisition of all of  the outstanding stock of the
Company, the Acquired Companies are  becoming  subsidiaries of the
Purchaser.

 



 

**Agreement**

 



 

To  induce  the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the  Arrangement  Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the Stockholder  agrees  as follows:

 



 

**1.** **No  Hiring or Solicitation of Employees.** The  Stockholder, during
the Nonsolicitation Period, shall not (a) hire any  Specified Employee, or
(b) personally or through others, encourage,  induce,  attempt to induce,
solicit or attempt to solicit (on the Stockholder's own  behalf or on behalf
of any other Person) any Specified Employee or  any other  employee to leave
his or her employment with the Purchaser, any of  the Acquired  Companies or
any of the Purchaser's other subsidiaries. (For purposes of this  Section 1,
"Specified Employee" shall mean any individual who (i) is or was an  employee
of any of the Acquired Companies on the date of this Nonsolicitation 
Agreement or during the 360-day period ending on the date of this 
Nonsolicitation Agreement, and (ii) remains or becomes an employee  of the 
Purchaser, any of the Acquired Companies or any of the Purchaser's other 
subsidiaries on the date of this Nonsolicitation Agreement or at  any time
during  the Nonsolicitation Period.)

 



 

**2.** **Confidentiality. ** The  Stockholder shall hold all Confidential
Information in strict confidence  and  shall not at any time (whether during
or after the Nonsolicitation  Period):  (a) reveal, report, publish,
disclose or transfer any Confidential  Information to any Person (other than
the Purchaser or the Company);  (b) use any Confidential Information for any
purpose; or (c) use any  Confidential Information for the benefit of any
Person (other than  the Purchaser  or the Company); except as required for
statutory, judicial, regulatory  or legal  purposes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  the  event that the Stockholder is requested or required for
statutory,  judicial,  regulatory or legal reasons to disclose any
Confidential Information,  it is  agreed that the Stockholder will provide
the Purchaser or the Company  with  prompt notice of such request or
requirement so that the Purchaser  or the  Company may, at its option and
its own expense, seek an appropriate  protective  order or other remedy to
assure that the Confidential Information  will be  accorded confidential
treatment.

 



 

**3.** **Representations  and Warranties.** The  Stockholder represents and
warrants, to and for the benefit of the  Indemnitees,  that: (a) he has full
power and capacity to execute and deliver,  and to perform  all of his
obligations under, this Nonsolicitation Agreement; and  (b) neither  the
execution and delivery of this Nonsolicitation Agreement nor  the
performance  of this Nonsolicitation Agreement will result directly or
indirectly  in a  violation or breach of any agreement or obligation by
which the Stockholder  or any of his Affiliates is or may be bound. The
Stockholder's representations  and warranties shall survive the expiration of
the Nonsolicitation  Period as  required.

 



 

**4.** **Specific  Performance.** In  the  event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Stockholder of any  covenant or  obligation
contained in this Nonsolicitation Agreement, each of the  Purchaser,  the
Company and the other Indemnitees shall be entitled (in addition  to any 
other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages)  to
seek  and obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the  observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an 
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. No Indemnitee  shall
be  required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument  in
connection  with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this  Section 4,  and the Stockholder irrevocably waives any right he may
have to require  any  Indemnitee to obtain, furnish or post any such bond or
similarly  instrument;  save and except that the Indemnitee shall still be
required to provide  an  undertaking as to damages in the event of an
Indemnitee applying  for injunctive  relief.

 



 

**5.** **Indemnification. ** Without  in any way limiting any of the rights
or remedies otherwise available  to any of  the Indemnitees, the Stockholder
shall indemnify and hold harmless  each  Indemnitee against and from any
loss, damage, injury, harm, detriment,  lost  opportunity, liability,
exposure, claim, demand, settlement, judgment,  award,  fine, penalty, tax,
fee (including attorneys' fees), charge or expense (whether  or not relating
to any third-party claim) that is suffered or incurred  at any  time
(whether during or after the Nonsolicitation Period) by such  Indemnitee,
or  to which such Indemnitee otherwise becomes subject at any time (whether 
during  or after the Nonsolicitation Period), and that arises out of or by 
virtue of, or  relates to, (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or  warranty contained in this Nonsolicitation Agreement, or
(b) any failure on  the part of the Stockholder to observe, perform or abide
by, or any  other breach  of, any restriction, covenant, obligation or other
provision contained  in this  Nonsolicitation Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**6.** **Non-Exclusivity. ** The  rights and remedies of the Purchaser, the
Company and the other Indemnitees  under this Nonsolicitation Agreement are
not exclusive of or limited  by any  other rights or remedies which they may
have, whether at law, in  equity, by  contract or otherwise, all of which
shall be cumulative (and not  alternative).  Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the rights and  remedies of the  Purchaser, the Company
and the other Indemnitees under this Nonsolicitation  Agreement, and the
obligations and liabilities of the Stockholder  under this  Nonsolicitation
Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights,  remedies, 
obligations and liabilities under the law of unfair competition,  under
laws  relating to misappropriation of trade secrets, under other laws and 
common law  requirements and under all applicable rules and regulations.
Nothing  in this  Nonsolicitation Agreement shall limit any of the
Stockholder's obligations, or  the rights or remedies of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the  other  Indemnitees, under the Arrangement Agreement;
and nothing in the  Arrangement  Agreement shall limit any of the
Stockholder's obligations, or any of the rights  or remedies of the
Purchaser, the Company, or any of the other Indemnitees,  under this
Nonsolicitation Agreement.

 



 

**7.** **Severability. ** Any  term  or provision of this Nonsolicitation
Agreement that is invalid or  unenforceable  in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity  or  enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions hereof or the  validity or  enforceability of
the offending term or provision in any other situation  or in  any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid  or  unenforceable,
the parties hereto agree that the court making such  determination  shall
have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific  words or 
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision  with
a  term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest 
to  expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or 
provision, and  this Nonsolicitation Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified.  In the event  such court does not exercise the power granted to
it in the prior  sentence, the  parties hereto agree to replace such invalid
or unenforceable term  or provision  with a mutually agreeable valid and
enforceable term or provision  that will  achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other  purposes of  such invalid or unenforceable
term.

 



 

**8.** **Governing  Law; Venue.**

 



 

**(a)** This  Nonsolicitation Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with,  and governed in  all respects by, the laws of the Province of
Alberta, Canada (without  giving  effect to principles of conflicts of
laws).

 



 

**(b)** Any  legal  action or other legal proceeding relating to this
Nonsolicitation  Agreement or  the enforcement of any provision of this
Nonsolicitation Agreement  may be  brought or otherwise commenced in a court
of competent jurisdiction  in the  Province of Alberta. The Stockholder:

 



 

**(i)** expressly  and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction
of each  court located  in the Province of Alberta (and each appellate court
located in the  Province of  Alberta), in connection with any such legal
proceeding;

 



 

**(ii)** agrees  that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
mail  addressed to  him at the address set forth on the signature page of
this Nonsolicitation  Agreement shall constitute effective service of such
process, summons,  notice or  document for purposes of any such legal
proceeding;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**(iii)** agrees  that each court located in the Province of Alberta shall be
deemed  to be a  convenient forum; and

 



 

**(iv)** agrees  not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise),
in any  such legal  proceeding commenced in any court located in the
Province of Alberta  any claim  that the Stockholder is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction  of such  court, that such legal proceeding
has been brought in an inconvenient  forum,  that the venue of such
proceeding is improper or that this Nonsolicitation  Agreement or the subject
matter of this Nonsolicitation Agreement  may not be  enforced in or by such
court.

 



 

**(c)** THE  STOCKHOLDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN
CONNECTION  WITH ANY  LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS NONSOLICITATION
AGREEMENT OR THE  ENFORCEMENT  OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS NONSOLICITATION
AGREEMENT.

 



 

**9.** **Waiver. ** No  failure on the part of the Purchaser, the Company or
any other Indemnitee  to  exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Nonsolicitation  Agreement, and no delay on the part of the
Purchaser, the Company  or any other  Indemnitee in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under  this  Nonsolicitation Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver of such power,  right,  privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such  power, right,  privilege or remedy
shall preclude any other or further exercise  thereof or of  any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Indemnitee shall  be deemed to  have
waived any claim of such Indemnitee arising out of this Nonsolicitation
