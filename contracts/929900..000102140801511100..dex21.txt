39   EXHIBITS:  Exhibit A: Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation Exhibit B: Form of Non-Negotiable, Secured Promissory
Note     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of December 5, 2001, by and among
MEDTRONIC, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "Parent"), VIDAMED ACQUISITION
CORP., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent
("Merger Sub"), and VIDAMED, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that an acquisition of the
Company by the Parent is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the
Company by the Parent, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have each approved and declared advisable the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger, other than shares owned directly or indirectly by the Parent
or by the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 3.3) in accordance with the provisions
of Article 3 of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, upon execution of this Agreement,
the Parent will agree to loan the Company $5 million pursuant to a non-
negotiable, secured promissory note; and   WHEREAS, the Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1. 
THE MERGER   1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.3), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name
"Medtronic VidaMed, Inc.".   1.2. The Closing. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on a
date to be specified by the parties which will be no later than the second
Business Day (as defined below) after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date (as defined below)), set
forth in Article 7, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing being referred
to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing will take place by telecopy
exchange of signature pages with originals to follow by overnight delivery,
or in such other manner or at such place as the parties hereto may agree. The
Company will as promptly as practicable notify the Parent, and the Parent and
Merger Sub will as promptly as practicable notify the Company,  
1    when the conditions to such party\'s obligation to effect the Merger
contained in Article 7 will have been satisfied. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Business Day" will mean any day that is not a Saturday, a
Sunday or other day on which the offices of the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware is closed.   1.3. Effective Time. At the Closing, the
Company, the Parent and Merger Sub will file, or cause to be filed, with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the DGCL, in such form as is
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of, the
DGCL. The parties will take such other and further actions as may be required
by law to make the Merger effective. The Merger will become effective at the
time of such filing or, if agreed to by the Parent and the Company, at such
later time or date as is set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").   1.4. Effect of the Merger. At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  
ARTICLE 2.  THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   2.1. Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be amended as of the Effective Time to read as set forth in
Exhibit A to this Agreement.   2.2. Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At
the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, will be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law, the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the provisions
of such Bylaws.   2.3. Directors of the Surviving Corporation. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their respective deaths,
resignations or removals or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   2.4. Officers of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their respective deaths, resignations or removals or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may
be.   ARTICLE 3.  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; CANCELLATION AND CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   3.1.
Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company or Merger
Sub, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
remain outstanding as one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.   2     3.2. Cancellation of Treasury
Stock and Parent Owned Stock. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company or Merger
Sub, each share of Company Common Stock issued and held immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the Company\'s treasury and each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by the Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary
of the Parent (the "Cancelled Shares") will automatically be cancelled and
retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.   3.3. Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this Agreement (including
without limitation this Section 3.3 and Sections 3.4 and 3.7), automatically
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company
or Merger Sub, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3.7)), together with the associated
Company Rights (as defined in Section 4.4), will be converted into the right
to receive in cash from the Parent, without interest, an amount equal to
$7.91 (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock, together with the associated Company Rights (as defined
in Section 4.4), will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive,
upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 3.4 the
Merger Consideration.   3.4. Exchange of Certificates.   (a) From time to
time, as necessary, at or following the Effective  Time, the Parent must make
available to Computershare Investor  Services, LLC or such other commercial
bank or trust company designated  by the Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to the Company (the "Paying  Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common  Stock (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares), cash in the  amount required to be exchanged for shares of Company
Common Stock in  the Merger pursuant to Section 3.3 (such cash being
hereinafter  referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent must,
pursuant to  irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash contemplated to be
paid  pursuant to Section 3.3 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as 
contemplated by Section 3.4(f), the Exchange Fund must not be used for  any
other purpose.   (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective  Time, the Parent must cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of  record of a certificate or certificates (to the extent such 
certificates have not already been submitted to the Paying Agent) which 
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares 
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) of Company Common  Stock
(the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which will be  in customary
form and will specify that delivery will be effected, and  risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper  delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and will be in such  form and have such
other provisions as the Parent and the Paying Agent  will reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration  into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously  represented by such certificates will have
been converted into the  right to receive pursuant to this Agreement.   (c)
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for  cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed  and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such  other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent  pursuant to   3     such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to  receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of  Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, to be  distributed as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (after  giving effect to any required
tax withholding) in each case without  interest, and the Certificate so
surrendered will immediately be  cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company  Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the  Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the  Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is  presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to  evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable  stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated  by this Section 3.4, each Certificate will be deemed at all
times after  the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right
to  receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration with respect to 
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.   (d) Cash
paid upon conversion of the shares of Company Common  Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been  issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of  Company Common Stock
and, following the Effective Time, there will be  no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the  Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were  outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation  for any reason, they will be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in  this Section 3.4. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of  Certificates will cease to have any rights as stockholders
of the  Company, except as provided by law.   (e) To the extent permitted
by applicable law, any portion of the  Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of  Company Common Stock six months
after the Effective Time will be  delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of shares of  Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this  Article 3 must thereafter look only, as general
creditors, only to the  Parent for the Merger Consideration, without
interest. Any portion of  the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company  Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier  date, as is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would 
otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity) will,  to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the  Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person  previously entitled
thereto.   (f) Notwithstanding Section 3.3, none of the Paying Agent, the 
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be liable to any holder of  shares
of Company Common Stock for any cash delivered to a public  official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or  similar law.   (g) The
Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from  the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any  holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required  to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under  the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any  provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that  amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Parent, as  the case may be, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes  of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of  Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding  was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case
may  be.   4     (h) If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or
destroyed,  upon the delivery to the Paying Agent of an affidavit of that
fact by the  person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if  required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a  bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as  indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to 
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, 
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.   3.5. Stock
Options.   (a) Not later than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company  will send a notice (the "Option Notice") to all holders of
outstanding  options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Options"):  (i) specifying that such options will not be assumed in
connection with the  Merger, and (ii) specifying that any Company Options
outstanding as of the  Effective Time will terminate and be cancelled at such
time and represent  only the right to receive the consideration, if any,
specified in Section  3.5(c) in accordance with this Agreement.   (b) The
Company will permit each holder of a Company Option who  desires to exercise
all or any portion of such Company Option following  receipt of the Option
Notice to exercise such Company Option prior to the  Effective Time.   (c)
Each Company Option outstanding as of the Effective Time will  by virtue of
the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder  thereof, be
terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted  into, and
represent only, the right to receive an amount in cash equal to  the excess,
if any, of (i) the product of the Merger Consideration  multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock which are  issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option (regardless of whether such  Company Option is vested or
not) immediately prior to the Effective Time  over (ii) the exercise price of
those shares of Company Common Stock  subject to such Company Option. The
aggregate amount payable pursuant to  this Section 3.5(c) will hereinafter be
referred to as the "Option Cash-Out  Amount."   (d) Promptly following the
Effective Time, the Parent will cause  the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder (as of the Effective Time) of a  Company Option which was converted
into the right to receive the Option  Cash-Out Amount pursuant to Section
3.5(c) hereof, (i) a letter of  transmittal (which will be in such form and
have such other provisions as  the Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii)
instructions for use in  receiving cash payable in respect of such Company
Options. Upon the  delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed  in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with
the  documentation representing the Company Options surrendered thereby, to
the  Paying Agent, the holders of Company Options will be entitled to
receive  the Option Cash-Out Amount payable to them in respect of such
Company  Options pursuant to Section 3.5(c).   3.6. Warrants.   (a) Not
later than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company  will send a
notice to the holders of outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Company Warrants"): (i) specifying  that such warrants
will not be assumed in connection with the Merger, and  (ii) specifying that
any Company Warrants outstanding as of the Effective  Time will terminate and
be cancelled at such time and represent only the  right to receive the
consideration, if any, specified in this Section  3.6(a) in accordance with
this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each  Company Warrant will, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the  part of the holder thereof, be
converted into, and represent only, the  right to receive, upon   5    
delivery thereof to the Company, an amount in cash equal to the excess,  if
any, of (i) the product of the Merger Consideration multiplied by  the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of  such Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time over (ii)  the aggregate
exercise price of all such shares of Company Common Stock  exercisable under
such Company Warrant immediately prior to the  Effective Time. The aggregate
amount payable pursuant to this Section  3.6(a) will hereinafter be referred
to as the "Warrant Cash-Out  Amount."   (b) Promptly following the
Effective Time, the Parent will cause  the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder (as of the Effective Time) of a  Company Warrant if converted into the
right to receive the Warrant  Cash-Out Amount pursuant to Section 3.6(a), (i)
a letter of transmittal  (which will be in such form and have such other
provisions as the  Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for
use in  receiving cash payable in respect of such Company Warrants. Upon
the  delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly 
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with the 
documentation representing the Company Warrant surrendered thereby, to  the
Paying Agent, the holders of Company Warrant will be entitled to  receive the
Warrant Cash-Out Amount payable to them in respect of such  Company Warrants
pursuant to Section 3.6(a).   3.7. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
Section 3.3, to the extent (if at all) that holders of Common Stock are
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares"), will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to
receive from the Company such consideration as will be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder will have
failed to perfect or will effectively withdraw or lose his or her right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder\'s shares of Company Common
Stock will thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and such shares will not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Company will give the Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices or
demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The
Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate
any demands.   ARTICLE 4.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule referred to
in Section 4.1 below, which identifies by section number the provision of
this Agreement to which such exception relates, the Company represents and
warrants to the Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof as follows:  
4.1. Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has heretofore delivered to the
Parent a disclosure schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which is
divided into sections that correspond to the sections of this Article 4.  
4.2. Organization and Qualification.   (a) The Company and each subsidiary
of the Company (referred to  herein as a "Company Subsidiary") is a
corporation duly organized,  validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of its respective  jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite
corporate power   6     and authority to own, lease, and operate its
properties and to carry on  its business as now being conducted. The Company
and each Company  Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing to do
business in  each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased, or
operated by  it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such 
qualification necessary and where the failure to qualify could  reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as  defined below).  
(b) "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, change,  event,
circumstance or condition that, individually or in the aggregate  with all
similar effects, changes, events, circumstances or conditions,  is or would
reasonably be expected to: (i) have a material adverse  effect on the
business (including its prospects, current products or  products identified
for development), operations, assets, properties,  results of operations, or
financial condition of the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries, with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries  considered as a whole, (ii) prevent or
materially delay the  consummation of the Merger or otherwise have a material
adverse effect  on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this  Agreement, or (iii) unless resulting from or relating to any act
or  omission of the Parent following the date hereof (other than an act or 
omission required or reasonably contemplated by this Agreement), have a 
material adverse effect on the ability of the Surviving Corporation or  the
Parent to conduct such business (as presently conducted) following  the
Effective Time or the ability of Parent to exercise full rights of  ownership
of the Company or its assets or business; provided, however,  that there will
be excluded from the definition of Company Material  Adverse Effect (x) any
adverse effect, change, event, circumstance or  condition in the medical
device industry or in the economy generally  (as opposed to the Company
specifically), and (y) any adverse effect,  change, event, circumstance or
condition that results from the Parent\'s  refusal to permit the Company upon
the Company\'s request to the Parent  to take any of the actions itemized in

pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement, there are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule accurately sets forth information regarding the holder, the exercise
price, the date of grant or issuance, and the number of underlying securities
issuable in respect of each Company Warrant and Company Option. All
securities of the Company subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on
the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they

agreements, limitations on the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s voting
rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. To the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement and except as
contemplated by this Agreement, there are not any agreements that relate to
the voting or control of any outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. No
consent of holders of any Company Options or Company Warrants or of
participants in the Company ESPP, is required to carry out the provisions of
Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 6.10. All actions, if any, required on the part of the
Company under the Company Options, Company Warrants and the Company ESPP to
allow for the treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants and the Company
ESPP as is provided in Section 3.5, 3.6 and 6.10, have been, or prior to the
Closing will be, validly taken by the Company. In no event will the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
(including all shares subject to then outstanding Company Options,
Company Warrants or other rights to acquire or commitments to issue shares of
Company Common Stock ) exceed 43,055,521 plus that number of shares of
Company Common Stock equal to $30,774 divided by the closing sale price of a

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the
"SEC"), at or prior to the time due, and has heretofore  made available to
the Parent true and complete copies of, all forms,  reports, schedules,
registration statements and definitive proxy  statements (together with all
information incorporated therein by  reference, the "Company SEC Reports")
required to be filed by it with  the SEC since January 1, 1999. As of their
respective dates, the  Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects with  the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended  (the "Exchange Act") or the Securities Act, as the case may
be, and the  rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company  SEC Reports. As of their respective dates and as of the date any 
information from such Company SEC Reports has been incorporated by 
reference, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement  of a
material fact or omit, to state a material fact required to    8     be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in 
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (b)
Each of the financial statements of the Company (including the  related
notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC  Reports
(including any similar documents filed after the date of this  Agreement)
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable  accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC  with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally  accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited  statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent  basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes  thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the  Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof  and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the  periods then
ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of  any unaudited
interim financial statements). Except for liabilities and  obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with  past practice
and which could not reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, since  the date of the most
recent consolidated balance sheet included in the  Company SEC Reports,
neither the Company nor any of the Company  Subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether  accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by GAAP to be set  forth on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated  Company Subsidiaries or in the notes
thereto.   4.6. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section
6.5(a)) and the Schedule 13E-3 (as defined in Section 6.5(a)) will, (i) at
the time the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 is filed with the SEC or
at any time it is amended or supplemented, (ii) on the date the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and (iii) at
the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made in or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
the Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein. The Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.   4.7 Authorization and
Enforceability. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the necessary
approval of its stockholders, the requisite corporate power and authority to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by the
Company\'s Board of Directors and, no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company (other than stockholder approval) or any Company Subsidiary
are necessary to authorize this Agreement, and, subject to obtaining the
approval of the Company\'s stockholders, no other corporate action on
the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company has declared the advisability of this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to laws
of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and
rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief, or other
equitable remedies. The Company\'s Board of Directors has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and such approvals are  
9    sufficient so that neither the restrictions on "business
combinations" set forth in Section 203(a) of DGCL nor the provisions of any
other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," or other
similar anti-takeover statute or regulation nor the provisions of any
applicable anti-takeover provisions in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or Restated Bylaws of the Company will apply to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Under applicable
law, the current Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and the
rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date,
established by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the
Restated Bylaws of the Company, applicable law and this Agreement, is the
vote required for the stockholders of the Company to adopt this
Agreement.   4.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
contemplated hereby or as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since December 31, 2000, there has not been any change, effect,

or debt securities of,  or other ownership interests in, the Company;   (b)
any amendment of any provision of the Certificate of  Incorporation or Bylaws
of, or of any material term of any outstanding  security issued by, the

any  Company Subsidiary of any indebtedness for borrowed money other than

other  than (i) pursuant to Company Options or Company Warrants outstanding

parties in the  ordinary course of business) or any merger or consolidation
with any third  party, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary;  
10     (g) entry by the Company into any joint venture, partnership or

interest, pledge or encumbrance of any kind or nature (any of the foregoing
being a "Lien") on any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, franchise, permit, authorization,
agreement, or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party, or by which it or any of its properties or
assets may be bound, except, (x) in the cases of clauses (b) or (c), where
such violation, failure to make any such filing or failure to obtain such
permit, consent or approval, could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (y)
in the case of clause (d), for any such violations, breaches, defaults,
or other occurrences that could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
4.10. Permits. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all registrations, franchises, grants, authorizations
(including marketing authorizations), licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary for each of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to manufacture, market, sell, or distribute the Company\'s
products or to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits"), except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits
could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits
could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   4.11 Compliance with Laws. Except to the extent
specifically disclosed on Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all activities of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are
currently being, conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state,

decrees, injunctions, permits, licenses, certificates, governmental
requirements, orders, and other similar items of any court or other
Governmental Entity (and including those of any nongovernmental self-
regulatory agency and including environmental laws or regulations), the
failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to  
11    have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has timely filed or otherwise provided all registrations, reports,
data, and other information and applications with respect to its medical
device, pharmaceutical, consumer, health care, and other governmentally
regulated products (the "Regulated Products") required to be filed with or

jurisdiction over the manufacture, use, or sale of the Regulated Products,
has complied with all applicable requirements of the FDA or other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Regulated Products, and all
regulatory licenses or approvals in respect thereof are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to file timely such registrations, reports,

have such licenses and approvals in full force and effect could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All documentation, correspondence, reports, data,
analyses and certifications relating to or regarding any medical devices of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, filed with or delivered by or on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Governmental
Entity was in all material respects true and accurate when so filed or

data, analyses and certifications do not remain true and correct.   4.12.

any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree that has had or could

Employee Matters. Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:   (a) None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any other  "person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(1) of
the Code, that  together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
considered a single  employer (an "Affiliated Organization") pursuant to
Section 414(b), (c),  (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 3(5) or 4001(b)(1) of
the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
sponsors,  maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to or has or
could  have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct
or  indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to, any "employee pension 
benefit plan" ("Pension Plan"), as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of 
ERISA, including, without limitation, any such plan that is excluded from 
coverage by Section 4 of ERISA or is a "Multiemployer Plan" within the 
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. To the knowledge of the 
Company, each such Pension Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan has been 
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in 
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of  ERISA,
the Code and other applicable law. Each such other Pension Plan has  been
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in 
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of  ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable law. All Pensions Plans which the  Company
operates as plans that are qualified under the provisions of  Section 401(a)
of the Code satisfy in form and operation all applicable  qualification
requirements.   (b) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has
or  could have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct
or  indirect, fixed or contingent, to any Pension Plan, the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") or any other person, arising directly or 
indirectly under Title IV of ERISA other than liability pursuant to Section 
4007 for premiums which are not yet due (without regard to any waiver). No 
"reportable event," within   12     the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any  Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. Neither the Company nor any  Affiliated Organization has ceased
operations at any facility or  withdrawn from any Pension Plan in a manner
which could subject the  Company or Affiliated Organization to liability
under Section 4062(e),  4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any
Affiliated  Organization maintains, contributes to or has participated in or
agreed  to participate in any Pension Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan. 
Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has been a party to  a
sale of assets to which Section 4204 of ERISA applied with respect to  which
it could incur any withdrawal liability (including any contingent  or
secondary withdrawal liability) to any Multiemployer Plan. Neither  the
Company nor any Affiliated Organization has incurred, or has  experienced an
event that will, within the ensuing 12 months, result  in, a "complete
withdrawal" or "partial withdrawal," as such terms are  defined respectively
in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, with respect  to a Pension Plan which is
a Multiemployer Plan, and nothing has  occurred that could result in such a
complete or partial withdrawal.  Neither the Company nor any Affiliated
Organization has incurred a  decline in contributions to any Multiemployer
Plan such that, if the  current rate of contributions continues, a 70 percent
decline in  contributions (as defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) will occur
within  the next three plan years.   (c) Neither the Company nor any
Affiliated Organization  sponsors, maintains, contributes to, is required to
contribute to, or  has or could have any liability of any nature, whether
known or  unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to
any  "employee welfare benefit plan" ("Welfare Plan"), as such term is 
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, whether insured or otherwise,  including,
without limitation, any such plan that is excluded from  coverage by Section
4 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan within the  meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA. To the knowledge of the Company,  each such Welfare Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan has been operated  in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and in compliance  in all material respects with applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code  and other applicable law. Each such other
Welfare Plan has been  operated in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and in  compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of  ERISA, the Code and all other applicable law. Benefits under
each  Welfare Plan are fully insured by an insurance company unrelated to
the  Company or any Affiliated Organization. No insurance policy or
contract  requires or permits retroactive increase in premiums or payments
due  thereunder. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has 
established or contributed to, is required to contribute to or has or  could
have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown,  direct or
indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to any "voluntary  employees\'
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section  501(c)(9) of the
Code, "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of  Section 419 of the Code,
"qualified asset account" within the meaning  of Section 419A of the Code or
"multiple employer welfare arrangement"  within the meaning of Section 3(40)
of ERISA. No Welfare Plan which is  a Multiemployer Plan imposes any post-
withdrawal liability or  contribution obligations upon the Company or any
Affiliated  Organization. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated
Organization  maintains, contributes to or has or could have any liability of
any  nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or 
contingent, with respect to medical, health, life or other welfare  benefits
for present or future terminated employees or their spouses or  dependents
other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of  ERISA or any
comparable state law.   (d) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated
Organization is a  party to, maintains, contributes to, is required to
contribute to or  has or could have any liability of any nature, whether
known or  unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to
any  bonus plan, incentive plan, stock plan or any other current or
deferred  compensation (other than current salary or wages paid in the form
of  cash), separation, retention, severance, paid time off, or similar  
13     agreement, arrangement or policy, or any individual employment, 
consulting or personal service agreement other than a Pension Plan or 
Welfare Plan ("Compensation Plans"). Each Compensation Plan has been 
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in 
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of  all
applicable law.   (e) There are no facts or circumstances which could,
directly or  indirectly, subject the Company or any Affiliated Organization
to any  (1) excise tax or other liability under Chapters 43, 46 or 47 of 
Subtitle D of the Code, (2) penalty tax or other liability under  Chapter 68
of Subtitle F of the Code or (3) civil penalty, damages or  other liabilities
arising under Section 502 of ERISA.   (f) Full payment has been made of all
amounts which the Company  or any Affiliated Organization is required, under
applicable law, the  terms of any Pension Plan, Welfare Plan or Compensation
Plan (each, a  "Plan" and, collectively, "Plans"), or any agreement relating
to any  Plan, to have paid as a contribution, premium or other remittance 
thereto or benefit thereunder. Each Pension Plan that is subject to the 
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code and/or Section 302  of
ERISA meets those standards and has not incurred any accumulated  funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 or 418B of the  Code or Section
302 of ERISA and no waiver of any minimum funding  requirements has been
applied for or obtained with respect to any  Pension Plan. The Company and
each Affiliated Organization has made  adequate provisions for reserves or
accruals in accordance with GAAP to  meet contribution, benefit or funding
obligations arising under  applicable law or the terms of any Plan or related
agreement. There  will be no change on or before Closing Date in the
operation of any  Plan or any documents with respect thereto which will
result in an  increase in the benefit liabilities under such Plans, except as
may be  required by law.   (g) The Company and each Affiliated Organization
has timely  complied in all material respects with all reporting and
disclosure  obligations with respect to the Plans imposed by the Code, ERISA
or  other applicable law.   (h) There are no pending or, to the Company\'s
knowledge,  threatened audits, investigations, claims, suits, grievances or
other  proceedings, and there are no facts that could give rise thereto, 
involving, directly or indirectly, any Plan, or any rights or benefits 
thereunder, other than the ordinary and usual claims for benefits by 
participants, dependents or beneficiaries.   (i) The transactions
contemplated herein do not result in any  payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise), forgiveness of debt,  distribution, increase in benefits,
obligation to fund, or the  acceleration of accrual, vesting, funding or
payment of any  contribution or benefit under any Plan. Except to the
extent  specifically disclosed on Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or property  or
the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement by any employee, officer, or director of  the Company or
any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual"  (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section  1.280G-1) under any Plan
currently in effect would be an "excess  parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of  the Code).   (j) No action or omission of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary  or any director, officer, employee, or
agent thereof in any way  restricts, impairs or prohibits the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation  or the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
successor from amending,  merging, or terminating any Plan in accordance with
the express terms  of any such plan and applicable law.   14     (k)
Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists and  the Company has
delivered or made available to the Parent true and  complete copies of: (i)
all Plans and related trust agreements or other  agreements or contracts
evidencing any funding vehicle with respect  thereto; (ii) the three most

communicated  to participants, currently in effect with respect to each Plan;

correspondence with regulatory authorities and  administrative policies,
manuals, interpretations and the like with  respect to each Plan.   4.14.
Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to
any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable

of Directors, nor the  manufacture, marketing, distribution, use or sale of

by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in  the Company\'s written business
plans presented to the Company\'s Board  of Directors, infringes on the
Intellectual Property rights of any  person.   (c) For purposes of this
Agreement "Intellectual Property" will  mean all rights, privileges and

Company Subsidiary that have developed Intellectual  Property in connection
with their employment with the Company or any  Company Subsidiary have
executed written agreements with the Company or  such Company Subsidiary
requiring the employee to assign to the Company  or such Company Subsidiary
all rights to such Intellectual Property. To  the Company\'s knowledge, no
employee of the Company or any Company  Subsidiary has entered into any
agreement that restricts or limits in  any way the scope or type of work in
which the employee may be engaged  or requires the employee to transfer,
assign or disclose any  Intellectual Property or information concerning the

such returns and reports (and all applicable ad valorem and value added taxes
as are due from the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been paid); and
(c) paid or accrued all taxes for which a notice of assessment or collection
has been received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than those
being contested or which the Company intends to contest in good faith by

taxing authority has asserted any claim for taxes, or to the knowledge of the
Company, is threatening to assert any claims for taxes from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have withheld
or collected and paid over to appropriate governmental authorities (or are
properly holding for such payment) all taxes required by law to be withheld
or collected by them. There are no liens for taxes upon the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than liens for taxes that are not

Regulation S-K); (ii) any joint ventures, partnerships, or similar
arrangements; (iii) other agreements or arrangements that give rise to a
right of the other parties thereto to terminate such material contract or to

Material Contracts"). The Company has provided or made available to the
Parent a true and accurate copy of all Company Material Contracts and all
such Company Material Contracts are valid and in full force and effect,
except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with their
terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
under the provisions of any Company Material Contract, except in each case
for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   17     4.19. Suppliers. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has received any notice or has any reason to believe that

any Environmental Law;  and (iii) any other chemical, material, substance or
waste, exposure to  which as of the date hereof is prohibited, limited or
regulated by any  Governmental Entity.   (d) "Environmental Release" will
mean any release, spill,  emission, leaking, injection, deposit, disposal,
discharge, dispersal,  leaching or migration into the atmosphere, soil,

change, event, circumstance or condition that, individually or in the
aggregate with all similar effects, changes, events, circumstances
or conditions, is or would reasonably be expected to: (i) have a material

consummation of the Merger or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

Material Adverse Effect any adverse effect, change, event, circumstance or
condition in the medical device industry or in the economy generally (as
opposed to the Parent specifically).   5.2. Ownership of Merger Sub. Merger
Sub is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent.   5.3.

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate

Agreement by the Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
and approved by the Boards of Directors of the Parent and Merger Sub and by
the Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. No vote of the holders of any class   20    or series of the
capital stock of the Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of the Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and rules of law

creation of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries under, any of the
terms, conditions, or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, franchise, permit, agreement, or other instrument or obligation to
which the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries is a
party, or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound, except (x) in the cases of clauses (b) or (c), where
such violation, failure to make any such filing or failure to obtain such
permit, consent or approval, could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (y)
in the case of clause (d), for any such violations, breaches, defaults, or
other occurrences that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   5.5. Information

Business of the Parent. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, the Parent will not take, or agree to commit to take, or fail to take
any action that would make any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Parent contained herein inaccurate or breached such that the
conditions in Section 7.3 will not be satisfied at, or as of any time prior
to, the Effective Time.   6.3. No Solicitation.   (a) The Company will
not, and will cause its Company  Subsidiaries and its and their officers,
directors, employees,  financial advisors, counsel, representatives and
agents (collectively,  "Representatives") not to, (i) directly or indirectly,
solicit,  initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate the making of
an  Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) engage in or knowingly 
encourage in any way negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide  any
non-public information to, any Third Party (as defined below)  relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or which may reasonably be  expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) agree to or  endorse any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that nothing  contained in this Section 6.3 or in any
other provision of this  Agreement will prohibit the Company or the
Company\'s Board of Directors  from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s
stockholders a position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from  making any legally required disclosure to the
Company\'s stockholders.    24     (b) As used in this Agreement, the
term "Acquisition Proposal"  means any offer or proposal for (i) a
transaction or series of related  transactions pursuant to which any person
(or "group" of persons as  such term is defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) other  than the Parent or Merger Sub (a "Third Party") acquires
25% or more of  the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, including
without  limitation a tender offer or an exchange offer which, if
consummated,  would result in a Third Party acquiring 25% or more of the
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) a merger or other
business  combination involving the Company pursuant to which any Third
Party  acquires securities representing 25% or more of the aggregate voting 
power of all outstanding securities of the company surviving the merger  or
business combination, or (iii) any other transaction pursuant to  which any
Third Party acquires control of assets (including for this  purpose the
outstanding equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) of  the Company
having a fair market value equal to 25% or more of the fair  value of all of
the assets of the Company immediately prior to such a  transaction.   (c)
As used in this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" will mean a  bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the  Company has
reasonably and in good faith determined after consultation  with, among other
persons, its financial advisors and outside counsel,  to be more favorable to
the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger,  taking into account all
relevant factors (including whether, in the  good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company, such  third party is reasonably able to finance
the transaction and all  regulatory approvals required in such transaction
could reasonably be  obtained).   (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.3(a), this  Agreement will not prohibit the Company\'s Board of
Directors from,  prior to the date on which the Company\'s stockholders adopt
this  Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, furnishing nonpublic
information  to or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Third
Party  that makes an unsolicited Superior Proposal, if, and only to the
extent  that, (i) the failure of the Company\'s Board of Directors to take 
action with respect to a Superior Proposal would be a breach of the  Board\'s
fiduciary duties to its stockholders imposed by applicable law;  (ii) prior
to first furnishing nonpublic information to, or first  entering into
substantive discussions and negotiations with, such Third  Party after the
date hereof, the Company (A) provides written notice of  at least five
Business Days to the Parent to the effect that it intends  to furnish
information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations  with, such Third
Party, and naming and identifying the Third Party  making the Acquisition
Proposal, and (B) receives from such Third Party  an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to  the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement dated June 4, 2001  between the Company and the
Parent; and (iii) the Company concurrently  provides the Parent with all non-
public information to be provided to  such Third Party that the Parent has
not previously received from the  Company, and the Company keeps Parent
reasonably informed of the status  and the material terms and conditions and
all other material  information with respect to any such discussions or
negotiations.   (e) The Company agrees that it will notify the Parent within
two  (2) Business Days if it or any of its Representatives receives an 
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry reasonably likely to lead to a 
Acquisition Proposal or if any discussions or negotiations are sought  to be
initiated or continued with the Company or its Representatives  concerning an
Acquisition Proposal, and such notification will contain  the name of the
Third Party involved and the material terms and  conditions of such an
Acquisition Proposal.   (f) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company
will  immediately terminate all discussions with Third Parties concerning
any  Acquisition Proposal, and will request that such Third Parties
promptly  return any confidential information furnished by the Company in  
25     connection with any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not
waive  any provision of any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement  entered into with any Third Party regarding any Acquisition
Proposal,  and prior to the Closing will enforce all such agreements in
accordance  with their terms.   (g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3
will (i) permit the  Company to terminate this Agreement (except as
specifically provided in  Article 8 hereof), or (ii) permit the Company to
enter into any  agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (other than
the  confidentiality agreement as provided, and in the circumstances and 
under the conditions set forth, above) for as long as this Agreement  remains
in effect.   6.4. Company Stockholders Meeting.   (a) The Company will
promptly take all action necessary in  accordance with the DGCL and the
Company\'s Restated Certificate of  Incorporation and Restated Bylaws to
cause a meeting of its  stockholders (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting")
to be duly called  and held to consider and vote upon the approval and
adoption of this  Agreement and the Merger and the Company will use its
commercially  reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
as soon as  practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Board of
Directors of  the Company will, subject to Section 6.4(b), recommend such
approval  and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and will take all
lawful  action to solicit such approval, including, without limitation,
timely  mailing the Proxy Statement, unless such recommendation or
solicitation  would be a breach of the Company\'s Board of Directors\'
fiduciary duties  to its stockholders imposed by applicable law.   (b) The
Board of Directors of the Company will not withdraw, or  modify in a manner
adverse to the Parent, its recommendation to its  stockholders unless (i) the
Company has complied with the terms of  Section 6.3 in all material respects,
including, without limitation,  the requirement in Section 6.3 that it notify
the Parent after its  receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) such
withdrawal or  modification is required under applicable law in order for the
Board of  Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to
its  stockholders. Any withdrawal or modification of the recommendation of 
the Company\'s Board of Directors in accordance with the previous  sentence
will not constitute a breach of the Company\'s representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. Unless  this Agreement
is previously terminated in accordance with Article 8,  the Company will
submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the  Company Stockholders\'
Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the  Company determines at any time
after the date hereof that it is no  longer advisable or recommends that the
Company stockholders reject it  (and not postpone or adjourn such meeting or
the vote by the Company\'s  stockholders upon this Agreement and the Merger
to another date without  the Parent\'s approval).   (c) The Parent will
vote (or consent with respect to) any shares  of common stock of Merger Sub
beneficially owned by it, or with respect  to which it has the power (by
agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause  to be voted (or to provide a
consent), in favor of the adoption of this  Agreement at any meeting of the
stockholders of Merger Sub at which  this Agreement will be submitted for
adoption and at all adjournments  or postponements thereof (or, if
applicable, by any action of the  stockholders of Merger Sub by consent in
lieu of a meeting).   26     6.5. Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3  
(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this  Agreement, the
Company and the Parent will jointly prepare a Rule 13E-3  Transaction
Statement (together with any amendments thereto, the  "Schedule 13E-3") and
the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a  proxy statement (together
with any amendments thereto, the "Proxy  Statement") relating to the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting. Both the  Parent and the Company will cause the
Schedule 13E-3 to comply as to  form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the  Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, the rules and  regulations of Nasdaq and the DGCL. The Company
will cause the Proxy  Statement to comply as to form in all material respects
with the  applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations  thereunder, the rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the DGCL.
Both the  Company and the Parent will furnish to each other all information 
concerning the Company or the Parent each may reasonably request in 
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Schedule 13E-3  and
the Proxy Statement. All filings by the Company with the SEC in  connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the  Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto, will be  subject to the prior review of
the Parent and all mailings to the  Company\'s stockholders in connection
with the transaction contemplated  by this Agreement will be subject to the
prior review of the Parent.  All filings by the Parent with the SEC in
connection with the  transactions contemplated hereby, including the Schedule
13E-3 and any  amendment or supplement thereto, will be subject to the prior
review of  the Company will be subject to the prior review of the Parent.
The  Company, with the cooperation of the Parent, will use its reasonable 
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to each of the 
Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the compliance  with
SEC filing requirements and, if necessary, satisfactory resolution  of SEC
comments. The Company will also promptly file, and, if required,  mail to the
Company\'s stockholders, any amendment to the Proxy  Statement which may
become necessary after the date the Proxy Statement  is first mailed to the
Company\'s stockholders. The Company and the  Parent will also promptly file
any amendment to the Schedule 13E-3  which may become necessary after the
date the Schedule 13E-3 is first  filed with the SEC.   (b) No amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the  Schedule 13E-3 will be made by the
Company without the approval of the  Parent, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  The Company will advise the Parent
promptly after it receives notice  thereof of any request by the SEC or
Nasdaq for amendment of the Proxy  Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 or
comments thereon and responses  thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information.   (c) The Proxy Statement will include the recommendation of
the  Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company 
that they vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the  Merger,
except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 or 6.4 of this  Agreement.  
(d) The information supplied by the Company included in the Proxy  Statement
and the Schedule 13E-3 will not, at (i) the time the Proxy  Statement and the
Schedule 13E-3 is filed with the SEC; (ii) the time  the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is  first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, (iii) the time of the  Company Stockholders\'
Meeting and (iv) the Effective Time, contain any  untrue statement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact  required to be stated
therein, in light of the circumstances under  which they were made, or
necessary in order to make the statements  therein not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any  event or circumstances relating to the
Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries, or their respective officers and
directors, should be  discovered by the Company that should be set forth in
an amendment or a  supplement to the Proxy Statement   27     or the
Schedule 13E-3, the Company will promptly inform the Parent. All  documents
that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in  connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to  form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the  DGCL, the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and Nasdaq.   (e) The information supplied by the Parent
included in the  Schedule 13E-3 or for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will
not, at (i)  the time the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 is filed
with the  SEC; (ii) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof
or  supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, 
(iii) the time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and (iv) the  Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail  to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary  in order to make
the statements therein not misleading. If at any time  prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the  Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, or their respective officers and  directors, should be
discovered by the Parent that should be set forth  in an amendment or a
supplement to the Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy  Statement, the Parent will
promptly inform the Company. All documents  that the Parent is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection  with the transactions contemplated
hereby will comply as to form in all  material respects with the applicable
requirements of the DGCL, the  Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and
Nasdaq.   6.6. Confidentiality. The Parent and the Company will comply with,
and will cause their respective representatives to comply with, in all
respects, all of their respective obligations under the confidentiality
agreement between the parties dated June 4, 2001 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), and in no event, will the negotiation, entering into or
termination of this Agreement be deemed to waive or otherwise adversely
affect the rights and obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality
Agreement, which rights and obligations will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.   6.7. Access to Information.   (a)
Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement  or similar
agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any of the  Company
Subsidiaries is a party (in which case the Company will use all  commercially
reasonable efforts to provide acceptable alternative  arrangements, not in
violation of such agreement or arrangement, for  disclosure to the Parent or
its advisors) or pursuant to applicable  law, the Company will afford to the
Parent and to the Parent\'s  accountants, officers, directors, employees,
counsel, and other  representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours upon  reasonable prior notice, from the date hereof through the
Effective  Time, to all of its properties, books, data, contracts,
commitments,  and records, and, during such period, the Company will furnish
promptly  to the Parent all information concerning the Company\'s and the
Company  Subsidiaries\' businesses, prospects, properties, liabilities,
results  of operations, financial condition, product evaluations and
testing,  pilot studies, clinical data and studies and evaluations, patient 
results, regulatory compliance, officers, employees, third party  clinical
investigators, consultants, distributors, customers,  suppliers, and others
having dealings with the Company as the Parent  may reasonably request and
reasonable opportunity to contact and obtain  information from such officers,
employees, investigators, consultants,  distributors, customers, suppliers,
and others having dealings with the  Company as the Parent may reasonably
request. The Company\'s obligation  to afford access and provide information
pursuant to the preceding  sentence will include, without limitation, such
access and information  as the Parent will deem necessary to enable the
Parent, or a third  party designated by the Parent, to conduct a full audit
of the  Company\'s product performance and quality, pilot studies, clinical
data  and results, patient results, compliance with FDA regulations,
policies  and procedures, QSR compliance, manufacturing scale-up relations
and  dealings with third party physicians and other clinical investigators 
and consultants, and related performance,   28    manufacturing, and
compliance matters concerning the Company\'s products. During the period from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, the parties will in good faith meet
and correspond on a regular basis for mutual consultation concerning the
conduct of the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' businesses and,
in connection therewith, Parent will be entitled to be kept informed
concerning, the Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' operations and
business planning.   (b) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 will
affect any representation or warranty contained herein of any party hereto or
any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.  6.8. Approvals and
Consents; Cooperation.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to cooperate with
each other and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
submissions of information, applications and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining and maintenance of
all necessary consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, investigating or challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement.   (b) The Parent and the Company will file as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement notifications under the HSR Act,
if required, and will respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries or
requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and
will respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests
received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties will
cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings
or responses, including providing copies of all such documents to the other
party and its advisors prior to filing or responding. The Parent and Merger
Sub agree to use their respective reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of
(or, if entered, to lift, vacate or reverse) any order, decree, judgment or
ruling of any court or Governmental Entity restraining or preventing the
consummation of the Merger on the basis of any federal, state or local
antitrust laws or regulations. Concurrently with the filing of notifications
under the HSR Act or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Company and the
Parent will each request early termination of HSR Act waiting period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, will be required (and
the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree, but
will, if so directed by Parent, agree, effective after the Effective Time) to
hold separate or divest any of their respective assets or operations or enter
into any consent decree or licensing or other arrangement with respect to any
of their assets or operations or to otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits its   29     freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, as of and  after the Effective Time any businesses
or assets of the Company, the  Parent or any of their respective
affiliates.   (c) Each of the Company and the Parent will promptly inform
the  other party of any material communication received by such party from 
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department  of
Justice or any other governmental or regulatory authority regarding  any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   6.9. Employee Benefits and Employee
Matters. From and after the Effective Time, the Parent will provide, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, employee benefits and programs
("Parent Employee Benefit Plans") to the Company\'s employees that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable or more favorable, as a whole, than
those in existence as of the date hereof and provided or made available to
the Parent prior to the execution hereof; provided that stock-based
compensation will be comparable to that offered by the Parent and its
subsidiaries generally. To the extent the Parent satisfies its obligations
under this Section 6.9 by maintaining Company benefit plans, the Parent will
not be required to include employees of the Company in Parent Employee
Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, the Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, grant all employees of the Company
and any Company Subsidiaries credit under any Parent Employee Benefit Plans
for purposes of eligibility, level of participation and vesting under each
employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or the Company for
such employees service with the Company (provided, however, that no such past
service credit will be granted to the extent it would result in duplicative
accrual of benefits for the same period of service). Under no circumstances
shall employees receive credit for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to
the Effective Time with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be, for benefit accruals under any employee pension benefit plan (as defined
by Section 3(2) of ERISA) or any retiree health plan. The Company will use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause executives and other key
employees of the Company designated by the Parent to enter into agreements
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent with the Surviving Corporation as soon
as practicable following the date of this Agreement.   6.10. Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company will take all actions necessary
pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP in order that (i) no new Offering
Periods (as defined in the Company ESPP) under such plan shall commence
following the expiration of the current Offering Period which ends
on December 31, 2001 and (ii) the Company ESPP will terminate immediately
prior to the Effective Time.   6.11. Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party
incurring such costs and expenses, except that the Parent and the Company
will share equally all the costs of the filing fees required under the HSR
Act and the filing fees required in connection with the Proxy Statement and
the Schedule 13E-3.   6.12. Further Actions. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided and without being required to waive any conditions
herein (whether absolute, discretionary, or otherwise), each of the parties
hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement will take all such necessary action.   6.13. Officers\' and
Directors\' Indemnification.   30     (a) The Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agree that the  Surviving Corporation will provide to the
directors and officers of the  Company indemnification to the fullest extent
provided by its  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws with respect to
matters  occurring prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation
the  authorization of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated 
hereby until the six year anniversary date of the Effective Time (or,  in
case of matters occurring prior to the Effective Time giving rise to  claims
that are made prior to but which have not been resolved by the  sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, until such matters are finally 
resolved).   (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the 
Parent will, at its selection, either: (i) cause to be maintained in  effect
the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability  insurance policy
(a copy of which has been heretofore delivered or made  available to the
Parent or its advisors) with respect to claims arising  from facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;  or (ii) extend the
discovery or reporting period under the Company\'s  current policy for six
years from the Effective Time to maintain in  effect directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance with respect to  claims arising from facts or
events that occurred at or prior to the  Effective Time for those persons who
are currently covered by the  Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy on terms  no less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance policy; or  (iii) substitute coverage under the Parent\'s
directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance or coverage under other
policies providing coverage  on terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to such persons  than the Company\'s current insurance with
respect to claims arising  from facts or events that occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time;  provided, however, that in no event will the Parent be
required to  expend for any such coverage an amount per year in excess of
100% of  the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance;  and provided further that if the cost per year of such coverage
exceeds  such 100% amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain such coverage
as  is available for a cost per year not exceeding such amount. The Company 
represents that the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the annual 
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance.   (c) In addition
to the other rights provided for in this Section  6.13 and not in limitation
thereof (but without in any way limiting or  modifying the obligations of any
insurance carrier contemplated by this  Section 6.13), the Parent will
guarantee the obligations of the  Surviving Corporation to honor all
indemnification obligations under  the Company\'s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company\'s  Restated Bylaws and any indemnification
agreements between the Company  and any person (all copies of which have been
previously provided or  made available to Parent) as same exist, if at all,
as of the date  hereof.   6.14. Notification of Certain Matters. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent, and the Parent will
give prompt written notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of which would
be likely to cause any representation or warranty contained herein to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective
Date and (b) any material failure of the Company or the Parent, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.14 will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   31     6.15. Term Loan. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Parent will loan the Company $5 million pursuant to a non-negotiable, secured
promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (the
"Note").   ARTICLE 7.  CLOSING CONDITIONS   7.1. Conditions to
Obligations of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. The respective
obligations of each party to consummate the Merger and to consummate the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on the Closing
Date will be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of
the following conditions, any or all of which may be waived by the party for
whose benefit such conditions exist, in whole or in part, to the
extent permitted by applicable law:   (a) This Agreement will have been
approved by the requisite  affirmative vote of the stockholders of the
Company in accordance with  the Company\'s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, Restated Bylaws  and the DGCL.   (b) No Governmental Entity
or court of competent jurisdiction  will have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any law,  rule, regulation or order which is then in
effect and has the effect of  making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the  Merger.   (c) The waiting periods
applicable to the consummation of the  Merger under the HSR Act will have
expired or been terminated.   (d) All consents, approvals, authorizations
legally required to  be obtained to consummate the Merger will have been
obtained from all  Governmental Entities or persons as applicable and will be
final (in  the case of any consent or waiver from a Governmental Entity) and
in  full force and effect as of the Closing, except for such consents, 
approvals and authorizations the failure of which to obtain could not 
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a  Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or after the Effective  Time, a
material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation (assuming  for purposes
of this paragraph (e) that the Merger will have been  effected).   7.2.
Conditions to Obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub. The obligation of the
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger will be subject to the
fulfillment or waiver by the Parent at or prior to the Closing of
the following additional conditions:   (a) Each representation and warranty
of the Company contained in  this Agreement is true and correct on the date
hereof and as of the  Effective Time as though such representations and
warranties were made  on such date (except those representations and
warranties that address  matters only as of a particular date will remain
true and correct as of  such date), except for any inaccuracies that have not
had, and could  not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a  Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
notwithstanding the  foregoing, this Section 7.2(a) will not be considered
fulfilled or  satisfied if the representation and warranty set forth in the
last  sentence of Section 4.4 is incorrect by more than 1,000 shares as of 
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 7.2(a), all  representations
and warranties contained in Article 4 qualified by  "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or reference to "material" or "in all  material respects" or like
variations will not be deemed so qualified.   32     (b) The Company has
performed and complied in all material respects  with all agreements,
obligations and conditions required by this Agreement  to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time.   (c) The Company
will have furnished the Parent with a certificate  dated the Closing Date
signed on behalf of the Company by its President and  Chief Executive Officer
or its Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial  Officer to the effect
that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) and  (b) have been
satisfied.   (d) The Company will have obtained all permits,
authorizations,  consents, and approvals required on its part to perform its
obligations  under, and consummate the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement, in  form and substance satisfactory to the Parent, except for such
permits,  authorizations, consents and approvals the failure of which to
obtain could  not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a  Company Material Adverse Effect, and the Parent and Merger Sub
will have  received evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the receipt
of such  permits, authorizations, consents, and approvals.   (e) Since the
date of this Agreement, there will not have occurred or  come into existence
any change, event, occurrence, state of facts or  development that has had,
or could reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   7.3. Conditions to Obligations of the
Company. The obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger will be
subject to the fulfillment or waiver by the Company at or prior to the
Closing of the following additional conditions:   (a) Each representation
and warranty of each of the Parent and Merger  Sub contained in this
Agreement is true and correct on the date of this  Agreement and as of the
Effective time as though such representations and  warranties were made on
such date (except those representations and  warranties that address matters
only as of a particular date will remain  true and correct as of such date),
except for any inaccuracies that have  not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in  the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this  Section 7.3(a), all representations and
warranties contained in Article 5  qualified by "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" or reference to "material" or  "in all material respects" or like
variations will not be deemed so  qualified.   (b) Each of the Parent and
Merger Sub has performed and complied in  all material respects with all
agreements, obligations and conditions  required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by the Parent  and Merger Sub on or prior to the
Closing.   (c) The Parent will have furnished the Company with a
certificate  dated the Closing Date signed on behalf of the Company by its
Chief  Executive Officer or its Chief Financial Officer to the effect that
the  conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and (b) have been satisfied.  
(d) Since the date of this Agreement, there will not have occurred or  come
into existence any change, event, occurrence, state of facts or  development
that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   33     ARTICLE 8. 
TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT   8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval by the stockholders of the Company, only:   (a) by mutual written
consent duly authorized by the Boards of  Directors of each of the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company;   (b) by either the Parent or the Company if the
Merger has not been  consummated on or before May 31, 2002; provided,
however, that the party  wishing to terminate under this Section 8.1(b) has
not breached in any  material respect its obligations under this Agreement in
any manner that  was the proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure to
consummate the  Merger by such date; and provided, further, that, if a
request for  additional information is received from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission  ("FTC") or Department of Justice ("DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act,
such date  will be extended to the 90th day following acknowledgment by the
FTC or  DOJ, as applicable, that the Parent and the Company have complied
with such  request, but in any event not later than July 31, 2002;   (c) by
either the Parent or the Company if a court of competent  jurisdiction or an
administrative, governmental, or regulatory authority  has issued a final
nonappealable order, decree, or ruling, or taken any  other action, having
the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining, or  otherwise prohibiting
the Merger;   (d) by either the Parent or the Company if, at the Company 
Stockholders\' Meeting, the requisite vote of the Company\'s stockholders
for  approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is not
obtained,  except that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(d)  will not be available to any party whose failure to perform
any obligation  under this Agreement has been the proximate cause of, or
resulted in, the  failure to obtain the requisite vote of the stockholders of
the Company;   (e) by the Parent if (i) the Company has breached its
obligations  under Section 6.3 hereof in any material respect, or (ii) the
Board of  Directors of the Company has recommended to the stockholders of the
Company  any Acquisition Proposal or will have resolved or announced an
intention to  do so, or (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company has
withdrawn or  modified in a manner adverse to the Parent its approval or
recommendation  of the Merger or (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer for
25% or more of  the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is announced
or commenced,  and, either (A) the Board of Directors of the Company
recommends acceptance  of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
stockholders or (B) within 10  Business Days after such tender offer or
exchange offer is so commenced,  the Board of Directors of the Company fails
to recommend against acceptance  of such tender offer or exchange offer by
its stockholders;   (f) by the Company prior to the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting if (i)  it is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement, (ii)  the Board of Directors of the Company has complied with, and
continues to  comply with, all requirements, conditions and procedures of
Section 6.3 in  all material respects and has authorized, subject to
complying with the  terms of this Agreement, the Company to enter into a
binding written  agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal and  the Company notifies the Parent in writing that it
intends to enter into  such binding agreement, which notice must have
attached to it the   34     most current version of such agreement ready
for execution, and (iii) the  Parent does not make, within five (5) Business
Days after receipt of such  notice from the Company, any offer that the Board
of Directors of the  Company reasonably and in good faith determines, after
consultation with  its financial and legal advisors, is at least as favorable
to the  stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal and during such
five  (5) business-day period the Company reasonably considers and discusses
in  good faith all proposals submitted by the Parent and, without limiting
the  foregoing, meets with, and causes its financial advisors and legal
advisors  to meet with, the Parent and its advisors from time to time as
requested by  the Parent to reasonably consider and discuss in good faith the
Parent\'s  proposals. The Company agrees (x) that it will not enter into a
binding  agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until at least the 6th
Business  Day after the Parent has received the notice to the Parent required
by  clause (ii) above, and (y) to notify the Parent promptly if its
intention  to enter into the binding agreement included in its notice to the
Parent  will change at any time after giving such notice;   (g) by the
Parent if (i) the Parent is not in material breach of its  obligations under
this Agreement and (ii) there has been a material breach  by the Company of
any of its representations, warranties or obligations  under this Agreement
such that the conditions in Section 7.2 hereof will  not be satisfied;
provided, however, that if such a breach is curable by  the Company through
its reasonable best efforts and such cure is reasonably  likely to be
accomplished prior to the applicable date specified in Section  8.1(b), then,
for so long as the Company continues to exercise such  reasonable best
efforts, the Parent may not terminate this Agreement under  this Section
8.1(g); or   (h) by the Company if (i) the Company is not in material breach
of its  obligations under this Agreement and (ii) there has been a material
breach  by the Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations, warranties
or  obligations under this Agreement such that the conditions in Section
7.3  hereof will not be satisfied provided, however, that if such a breach
is  curable by the Parent or Merger Sub through its reasonable best efforts
and  such cure is reasonably likely to be accomplished prior to the
applicable  date specified in Section 8.1(b), then, for so long as the Parent
or Merger  Sub continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts, the
Company may not  terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(h).   8.2.
Effect of Termination. The party desiring to terminate this Agreement will
give written notice of such termination to the other party. Except for
any willful breach of this Agreement by any party hereto (which willful
breach and liability therefore will not be affected by the termination of
this Agreement or the payment of any Termination Fee (as defined in Section
8.3 hereof)), if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof,
then this Agreement will become void and of no effect with no liability on
the part of any party hereto; provided, however that notwithstanding such
termination the agreements contained in Sections 6.6, 6.11, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and
Article 9 hereof will survive the termination hereof.   8.3. Termination
Fees.(a) The Company agrees to pay the Parent in  immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account designated by  the Parent an amount equal to
$13,040,000 (the "Termination Fee") if:   (i) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to Section  8.1(e) hereof; or   (ii) (A) this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company  pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(d)
hereof, (B) at or prior to the  time of such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the  Company will have been made public, and (C)  
35     within 12 months after such termination, the Company will enter
into a  definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
the  transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal relating to the 
Company will be consummated; or   (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to  Section 8.1(f) hereof.   (b) The Company will pay the
Termination Fee required to be paid  pursuant to Section 8.3(a) hereof (if
all conditions thereto have been  satisfied) (i) on the date of termination
of this Agreement by the Company,  (ii) not later than five Business Days
after termination of this Agreement  by the Parent, or (iii) in the case of a
fee payable pursuant to Section  8.3(a)(ii), prior to the earlier of the
execution of the definitive  agreement with respect to, and the consummation
of the transaction  contemplated by, the applicable Acquisition Proposal.  
8.4. No Penalty; Costs of Collection. The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are not a penalty, and that,
without these agreements, the Parent would not enter into this Agreement. If
the Company fails to pay promptly the fee due pursuant to Section 8.3, the
Company will also pay to the Parent the Parent\'s reasonable costs and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,
including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect
payment, together with interest on the amount of the unpaid fee under Section
8.3, accruing from its due date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two
percentage points in excess of the prime commercial lending rate quoted by
Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A.; provided, however, that the Parent will pay
to the Company the Company\'s reasonable costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any such legal action if the
Parent\'s claims against the Company in such legal action do not prevail. Any
change in the interest rate hereunder resulting from a change in such prime
rate will be effective at the beginning of the date of such change in such
prime rate.   ARTICLE 9.  GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1. Non-Survival of
Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement by any person will terminate at the
Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section

the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards

pursuant to the Merger or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the
Company\'s stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
