Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within 30 days after receiving the Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement, the parties hereto agree that the Proposed Final
Purchase Price Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the
parties. If Seller gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer (the items
and amounts in dispute, the " _Disputed Purchase Price Items_ ") within

 



-11-   such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to resolve

an office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that is not in New York or Ohio but

a determination regarding the Unresolved Purchase Price Items within 30 days
after referral of the matter to the Accounting Firm, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, which determination must be in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
therefor. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and
binding upon Seller, Buyer and the Company absent manifest error, and judgment
may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced.

(iii) The Accounting Firm shall be required to make a determination with
respect only to the Unresolved Purchase Price Items, and in a manner
consistent with this _Section 2.2_ and Accounting Principles, and in no
event shall the Accounting Firms determination of Unresolved Purchase Price
Items be for an amount outside the range of the parties disagreement. Each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Accounting Firm
such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Unresolved Purchase Price Items as the Accounting Firm may request.

(iv) Buyer shall revise the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement to reflect
the determination of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_.
The " _Final Purchase Price_ " means the Proposed Final Purchase Price as
revised pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_.

(v) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne in the same
proportion as the aggregate dollar amount of the Unresolved Purchase Price
Items that are unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all of the
Unresolved Purchase Price Items submitted to the Accounting Firm.

(vi) Until the Final Purchase Price is determined, each of Seller, Buyer and
the Company shall cooperate with, and, to the extent reasonably requested,
make their working papers, books, records and employees available to and
otherwise assist each other party and its accountants and other

partys review of, and the resolution of any objections with respect to, the
Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement.

(e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material
Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, other than

Plan_ ") has applied for or received a waiver of the minimum funding
standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code. The PBGC has not instituted
Proceedings to terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
plan sponsored by an ERISA Affiliate or to appoint a trustee or administrator

each Employee Benefit Plan and each ERISA Affiliate has made contributions to
its respective ERISA Affiliate Plans, which in each case is subject to Section
412 of the Code that is not less than the minimum required contribution under
Section 430 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates

ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; and
(v) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full.

(f) All required contributions and withdrawal Liability payments that the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate have been obligated to make to any
Multiemployer Plan have been duly and timely made. Any withdrawal Liability

date hereof. The Company has made available to Buyer all material information
in its possession with respect to the funding and compliance status of all
Multiemployer Plans.

(g) The Company and the ERISA Affiliates have complied, in all material
respects, with the requirements of COBRA.

(h) None of the Company, or, to the Companys Knowledge, any other Person, has
engaged in any transaction with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that
would be reasonably likely to subject the Company to any material Tax or
penalty (civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable
Law.

 

(i) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Buyer true, complete and correct copies, to the extent applicable, of (i)
the plan and trust documents and the most recent summary plan description, as
well as any other material employee communications, (ii) the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 series), (iii) the most recent financial statements
and/or actuarial reports and (iv) the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter.

 

(j) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.13(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, it being

 



-21-   understood that this parenthetical does not apply under circumstances where
the terms of the underlying arrangement are unaffected by such execution and
delivery or by such consummation) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or increase the amount of, any payment or benefit to
any employee, officer or director of the Company, or result in any limitation
on the right of the Company to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust. No amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code because Section 280G of the Code does not apply
in connection with such transactions as a result of application of Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(i) of the Code.

(k) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted in respect of the Employee
Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
Liability of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to the PBGC, the
Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Employee Benefit Plan,
any participant in any such Employee Benefit Plan, or any other party.

(l) Other than as set forth on _Section 3.13(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter and other than instances of non-compliance that are not material, each
Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated in

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company, the Company Intellectual Property
Rights (other than Software) identified on _Section 3.14_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter are validly registered, held and/or recorded in the name
of the Company, not subject, to the Companys Knowledge, to any pending
cancellation or reexamination proceeding and the Company Intellectual Property
Rights are owned exclusively by the Company free and clear of any Liens (other
than Permitted Liens and licenses granted to third parties).

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company, the Company Intellectual Property,

commitments, promises, communications or courses of conduct involving any
such Liability other than the Contracts listed in _Section 3.15(k)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter);

(l) other than Contracts for the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of

a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company and each other party
thereto, enforceable against the Company and each such other party, in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the
enforcement of creditors rights and subject to general principles of equity).
Except as set forth in _Section 3.15_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the other parties
thereto, are not in material default or material breach or have

 



-24-   not failed to perform any material obligation under, any of such Material
Contracts and no event has occurred and no circumstance exists which, with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a material
default or material breach. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the performance by the Company of its obligations under any Material Contract
does not breach any restrictive covenants or other restrictions binding on
the Company set forth in any of the Material Contracts. There are no oral
customer Contracts to which the Company is a party or by which it or any of
its assets or properties is otherwise bound or that otherwise relates to the
business of the Company, other than immaterial Contracts.

Section 3.16. _Insurance_.  _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains an accurate and complete list of all policies of fire, liability,
workers compensation, property, casualty and all other forms of insurance of
the Company covering the Company or its employees, officers, directors,
property or business which are in effect. The Company has previously provided
to Buyer true and complete copies of all policies listed on _Section 3.16_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. All such policies are in full force and effect
as of the date hereof and will continue in effect until the Closing (or if
such policies are cancelled or lapse prior to Closing, replacements or
renewals will be entered into in the ordinary course of business to the
extent available on commercially reasonable terms; _provided_ that any such
replacements or renewals shall be terminable without material cost to the
Company or Buyer at the Closing). No notice of cancellation or termination
(other than ordinary course periodic reminders of the end of a term of a
policy) has been received with respect to any such policy, and there is no
existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a material default thereunder. Such policies are in
amounts which are customary, adequate and suitable in relation to the
Companys business, assets and Liabilities and all premiums to date have been
paid in full. The Company is a "named insured" or an "insured" under such
insurance policies. Except as set forth in _Section 3.16_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company has not been refused any insurance, nor had its
coverage be limited in any material respect, by any insurance carrier to
which it has applied for insurance or with which it has carried insurance in
the past five years. _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Letter also
contains an accurate and complete description of all outstanding bonds and
other surety arrangements issued or entered into in connection with the
business, assets and Liabilities of the Company. In the last three years, the
Company has maintained insurance coverage that is substantially similar to
the coverage listed on _Section 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(such real property, the " _Leased Property_ ") to which the Company is a
party or by which it is bound (each a " _Material Lease_ " and collectively
the " _Material Leases_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 3.17(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, each Material Lease is valid and binding on the
Company and, to the Companys Knowledge, on the other parties thereto, and is
in full force and effect. Except as set forth in _Section 3.17(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and, to the Companys Knowledge, each
of the other parties thereto, is not in default under each Material 

 



-25-   Lease. Other than the Material Leases, none of the Leased Property is
subject to any lease, sublease, license or other agreement granting to any
Person any right to the use, occupancy or enjoyment of such Leased Property
or any part thereof.

Section 3.18. _Title to Assets_. The Company has good and valid title to or,
in the case of leased property, good and valid leasehold interests in, all of
the assets and properties used or held for use in connection with, necessary
for the conduct of, or otherwise material to, the business of the Company
(including those reflected on the Recent Balance Sheet, but excluding any such
assets and properties sold, consumed, or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary
course of business since the date of the Recent Balance Sheet), free and
clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and except as set forth in
_Section 3.18_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 3.19. _Related Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no Contract between the
Company and any Related Party other than employment or benefit arrangements
entered into in the ordinary course of business and disclosed to the Buyer
prior to the date hereof, and none of the Related Parties owns any property
or right, tangible or intangible, which is used by the Company.

Section 3.20.  _Brokers_. Except for Peter J. Solomon Company, L.P. (the "
_Advisor_ "), no Person is or will be entitled to a brokers, finders,
investment bankers, financial advisers or similar fee from the Company in
connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 3.21. _Significant Customers_. _Section 3.21_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists the 10 largest customers of the Company on a blind
basis based on aggregate gross sales in 2009 (the " _Significant Customers_
"), and the approximate dollar amount of such aggregate gross sales during
2009. Except as set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
since December 31, 2009, none of the Significant Customers has terminated its
relationship with the Company, and none of the Significant Customers has
notified Seller or the Company that it intends to terminate its relationship
with the Company. Except as set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and other than any reductions resulting from the
acquisition by a third party of a Significant Customer after the date hereof,
since December 31, 2009, the Significant Customers have not, as a group,
materially reduced their aggregate business with the Company nor has Seller or
the Company been notified by a Significant Customer of its intention to reduce
its business with the Company such that, together with any such notices
received from other Significant Customers, there would be a material reduction
in the aggregate business of the Significant Customers.

Section 3.22. _NO ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE III_ AND _ARTICLE IV_ OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At
the request of Buyer, each of Seller and the Company shall cooperate with
Buyer and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain each third-party consent
and approval required under each of the Contracts required to be listed on
_Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Each of Seller, the Company
and Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of all
Governmental Authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All governmental filing fees incurred in
connection with obtaining such consents, including the HSR Act filing fee,
shall be borne by Buyer and treated in accordance with _Section 10.4_. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties, each party hereto shall make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act within two Business Days of the
date hereof and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Without limitation of
the foregoing, the Company, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or
similar foreign antitrust or competition Laws or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) offer to take (and
if such offer is accepted, commit

 



-33-   to take) all steps which they are reasonably capable of taking to avoid or
eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Authority or Person with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as expeditiously as possible.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of Buyer (or such Affiliates) or, effective as of the Closing, the Company,
or otherwise offer to take (and take if the offer is accepted) any action
which it is reasonably capable of taking in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other Order in any Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event will Buyer be obligated to offer or agree to or accept
any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture of any interest in any real property, leasehold or intellectual
property or to accept any operational restriction, or to offer or to take
any other action, in each case, if, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, such
undertaking, condition, consent decree, divestiture, restriction or action
would reasonably be expected to involve or have an impact on revenues of the
combined business (or Buyer after giving effect to the transactions) in
excess of $75 million, as measured in the revenues of those businesses in the
twelve (12) months ending December 31, 2009. At the request of Buyer, Seller
and the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise commit to
take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to its ability
to retain any of the businesses, services, or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, provided that such action shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
shall (A) promptly notify the other party of any written or oral communication
to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental
Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication to, including filings made with, any of the
foregoing Governmental Authorities and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments, (B) not agree to participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion (including, without limitation, any discussion relating
to any antitrust merits, any potential remedies, commitments or undertakings,
the timing of any waivers, Permits or Orders, and any agreement regarding the
timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
with any Governmental Authority unless it consults with the other party and
its representatives in advance and invites the other partys representatives
to attend, unless the Governmental Authority prohibits such attendance, (C)
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult the other on and incorporate the reasonable comments to, any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (D)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their respective Affiliates on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, except that any
materials concerning one partys valuation of the other party or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any partys material financial
information, may be redacted.

 

(b) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person
is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties
agree to cooperate and use

 



-34-   reasonable best efforts to defend against such Proceeding and, if an
injunction or other Order is issued in any such Proceeding, to use reasonable
best efforts to have such injunction or other Order lifted, and to cooperate
reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Each party shall give prompt written notice to the other parties of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure will
or will reasonably likely delay the Closing or result in the failure to
satisfy any of the conditions specified in _Article VII_.

(d) At the request of Buyer, Seller shall take the actions specified in
_Section 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in preparation for the
Closing.

 

Section 6.5. _Public Announcements_. The timing and content of all
announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement to the financial
community, government agencies, employees or the general public shall be
mutually agreed upon in advance by Seller, the Company and Buyer; _provided_
that each party hereto may make any such announcement which it in good faith
believes, based on advice of counsel, is required by Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with
the other parties prior to any such announcement to the extent practicable,
and shall in any event promptly provide the other parties hereto with copies
of any such announcement.

Section 6.6.  _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Buyer hereby agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company or any applicable Affiliate of Buyer to, grant all
employees of the Company credit under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate
of Buyer in which any employee of the Company participates (the " _Buyer
Plans_ ") for any service with the Company earned prior to the Closing Date
credited under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan (i) for eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation
accrual, provided that such credit shall not be provided (x) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans of Buyer and its
Affiliates, not including any Employee Benefit Plan in effect prior to the
Closing Date, (y) as would result in a duplication of benefits, or (z) with
respect to newly established Buyer Plans that do not provide credit for past
service to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. In
addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer shall cause (A) the Company to waive
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Buyer Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date,
and (B) any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by
any employee (or covered dependent thereof) of the Company during the
applicable plan year to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after
the Closing Date under any applicable Buyer Plan (with respect to such year).

(b) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Company or an Affiliate of

 



-35-   Buyer to, provide all employees of the Company not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement with (i) employee benefits that are not less favorable in
the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and (ii) a level of compensation that
is not less favorable in the aggregate than compensation provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, provided that in the case
of either (i) or (ii), Buyer may satisfy its obligations under this _Section
6.6(b)_ by providing employee benefits or compensation, as applicable, not
less favorable than the employee benefits or compensation, as applicable,
provided to such employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to employees of the Company covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer
to, honor the terms of such agreement while in effect (including with respect
to employee benefits thereunder), it being understood that the foregoing shall
not be construed to limit or prohibit amendment or termination of any such
agreement to the extent permitted by the terms thereof.

(c) Buyer hereby agrees to cause the Company from and after the Closing
to continue to be bound by and comply with the terms of all written
employment agreements and severance agreements and plans of the Company
existing on the date hereof, including the Deferred Compensation Agreements
set forth on  _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_
that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit or prohibit amendment or
termination of any such agreements or plans to the extent permitted by the
terms thereof. 

(d) Buyer hereby agrees to cause the Company from and after the Closing to
continue to be bound by and comply with the terms of all collective
bargaining agreements to which the Company is a party as of the date hereof,
provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit or prohibit
amendment or termination of any such agreement to the extent permitted by
the terms thereof.

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.7_, the provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for
any purpose.

Section 6.7. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Buyer shall cause the Company to maintain in effect in its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar governing documents) for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing, the current provisions regarding elimination of
Liability of directors and indemnification, with respect to acts or conduct
prior to the Closing, of former officers and directors and
employees contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company (a) unless the provisions are amended, repealed or modified as
required by applicable Law or (b) unless the provisions are amended, repealed
or modified in connection with a restructuring in which the governing
documents of the successor to the Company includes substantially equivalent
exculpation or indemnification provisions with respect to such acts or conduct
for the benefit of such Persons, it being the intent of the parties that the
officers, directors and employees of the Company prior to the Closing shall
continue to be entitled for such 6-year

 



-36-   period to exculpation and indemnification under such provisions with respect
to acts or conduct prior to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law. If the Company is unable to financially satisfy the foregoing
indemnification obligations, Buyer shall or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to satisfy such obligations.

(b) Notwithstanding any time limit herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing) is made against any DandO Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ (without
regard to any such time limit) shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, proceeding or investigation.

(c) In the event that Buyer or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Buyer and the Company shall cause the successors or assigns of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, to succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.7_.

 

(d) This _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Closing, is intended to benefit the
Company and the present and former officers, directors or employees of the
Company as of the Closing (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_"), shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and shall be enforceable
by the DandO Indemnified Persons.

 

Section 6.8. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Certain Tax Returns_.

(i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, (A) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company on or before the Closing Date for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date and (B) all income Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by or with respect to the Company after the Closing Date for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date (collectively, " _Seller Pre-
Closing Period Returns_ ") and Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes
shown as due on such Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns, except to the extent a
Liability for such Taxes was specifically reflected and identified as such in
the Net Working Capital; _provided_  that the amount paid by Seller pursuant
to the foregoing shall not be taken into account in determining whether Seller
has reached the maximum aggregate obligation of Seller for claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.4(f)_. The expense of preparing any
Seller Pre-Closing Period Return shall be borne and paid prior to the Closing
by the Company or borne and paid after the Closing by Seller, as the case may
be. Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns of a Tax and a jurisdiction for which
Buyer does not request to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election (" _Specified
Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns_ ") shall be filed in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and past practice and no position shall be
taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods (the " _Past Practice
Requirement_ ") and Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns (other than
Specified Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns) shall be filed in a manner
consistent in all material respects with the Past Practice Requirement, except
in each case that new elections may be made therein if such 

 



-37-   elections were not previously available, subject to Buyers consent, any
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller Pre-Closing
Period Returns shall be submitted to Buyer not later than 30 days prior to
the due date for filing such Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns (taking into
account any extensions thereof) (or, if such due date is within 60 days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date) for review by Buyer. Buyer shall respond in writing to Seller with any
comments at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing such Seller Pre-
Closing Period Returns (taking into account any applicable extensions).
In the event Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve such comments at least 10
days prior to the due date for filing such Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns
(taking into account any applicable extensions), such dispute shall be
resolved by the Accounting Firm, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, prior to the due date for filing such Seller Pre-Closing Period
Return. Seller shall revise such Seller Pre-Closing Period Returns (or shall
cause such Seller Pre-Closing Period Return to be revised) to reflect the
resolution by the Accounting Firm.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns not described in
_Section 6.8(a)(i)_ that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company after the Closing Date for any Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date (" _Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns_ ") or any Straddle Period
(" _Straddle Period Returns_ "). Seller shall be responsible for the expense
of preparing any Buyer Pre-Closing Period Return, and the Company shall be
responsible for the expense of preparing any Straddle Period Return. Buyer
Pre-Closing Period Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Past Practice Requirement unless required by
applicable Law, except that new elections may be made therein if such
elections were not previously available, subject to Sellers consent, any
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer Pre-Closing
Period Returns and Straddle Period Returns shall be submitted to Seller not
later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Buyer Pre-Closing
Period Returns or Straddle Period Returns (taking into account any extensions
thereof) (or, if such due date is within 60 days following the Closing Date,
as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) for review by Seller.
Seller shall respond in writing to Buyer with any comments (such comments
being limited to ensuring that such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns and
Straddle Period Returns are prepared in a manner consistent with terms of
this Agreement and, in the case of such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns, the
Past Practice Requirement) at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing
such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns and Straddle Period Returns (taking into
account any applicable extensions). In the event Buyer and Seller are unable
to resolve such comments at least 10 days prior to the due date for filing
such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns and Straddle Period Returns (taking into
account any applicable extensions), such dispute shall be resolved by the
Accounting Firm, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, prior to the
due date for filing such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Return or Straddle Period
Return. Buyer shall revise such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns or Straddle
Period Returns (or shall cause such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Returns or
Straddle Period Returns to be revised) to reflect the resolution by the
Accounting Firm. Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Sellers
share of the Taxes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be net of any
Liability for such Taxes specifically reflected and identified as such in the
Net Working Capital) in connection with such Buyer Pre-Closing Period Return
or Straddle Period Return no later than five (5) days before the due date for
payment of such Taxes (taking into account any applicable extensions of the
due date for payment of such Taxes), _provided_ that the amount paid by Seller
to Buyer pursuant to the foregoing shall not be taken into account in
determining whether Seller has reached the maximum aggregate obligation of
Seller

 



-38-   for claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.4(f)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.8(a)(ii)_ shall limit any
Buyer Indemnitees right to recover under _Section 6.8(h)(i)_ except to the
extent of the amount Seller pays to Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence.

(b) _S Corporation Status and Certain Related Matters_. With respect to each
jurisdiction listed on _Section 3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and Seller shall not (A) revoke the Companys election to be taxed as
an S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code (or
any similar provision of state or local Tax Law); (B) take or allow any action
(other than the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement) that would
result in the termination of the Companys status as a validly electing S
corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state or local Tax Law); or (C) take or allow any action
(including in connection with the filing of Tax Returns) inconsistent with the
treatment of the Company for any period prior to the Closing as an S
Corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code (and any
similar provision of state or local Tax Law).

(c) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(i) If requested by Buyer, Seller and Mr. Rahr shall timely join (and shall
cause any Other Person to timely join) in making (x) an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and (y) any comparable election under any
provision of state or local Tax Law, with respect to the purchase of the
Shares under this Agreement (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") and shall
timely join in any filings that may be necessary in order to effect the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883, and any
comparable state or local Tax forms (" _Section 338 Forms_ "). To the extent
requested by Buyer, Seller and Mr. Rahr shall execute (and shall cause any
Other Person to execute) IRS Form 8023 (and any similar form under State or
local Tax Law) on or at any time after the Closing Date as so requested.
Buyer shall, with Sellers cooperation, prepare all Section 338 Forms
necessary in order to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election (other than IRS
Form 8883 and any comparable state or local Tax forms), and each of Buyer and
Seller shall prepare IRS Form 8883 and any comparable state or local Tax forms
(including any attachments and schedules thereto), which Section 338 Forms
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with this _Section 6.8(c)_.
Buyer, Seller and Mr. Rahr shall, or shall cause their relevant Affiliates,
to execute and timely file (and Seller and Mr. Rahr shall cause any Other
Person to execute and timely file) such Section 338 Forms with the applicable
Governmental Authorities. If the Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, Buyer,
Seller and Mr. Rahr agree that none of them shall, nor shall they permit any
of their Affiliates to, nor shall Seller or Mr. Rahr permit any Other Person
to, revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election following the filing of the
Section 338 Forms, without the prior written consent of Buyer or Seller, as
the case may be. If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local Tax Law),
Buyer, Seller and Mr. Rahr agree to report (and Seller and Mr. Rahr agree to
cause each Other Person to report) the purchase of the Shares pursuant to
this Agreement consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Election and Section
338 Forms and take no position inconsistent therewith.

 

(ii) If the Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, then within 180 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth the
allocation of the

 



-39-   Purchase Price and the Liabilities of the Company (plus other required
capitalized costs) (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") which schedule shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code. If
Seller does not notify Buyer in writing within 30 calendar days after
receiving the Allocation Schedule of any dispute, such Allocation Schedule
shall become final, binding and conclusive upon the parties. If there is any
dispute concerning the Allocation Schedule, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing within 30 calendar days after receiving the Allocation Schedule and
Seller and Buyer shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such
dispute. If within 15 calendar days of such notification, Seller and Buyer
shall have been unable to resolve their dispute, all unresolved items shall be
submitted to the Accounting Firm to be resolved in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and in no event shall the Accounting Firms determination
be for an amount outside the range of the parties disagreement. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the parties. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish
to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information
pertaining to the disputed item as the Accounting Firm may request. Buyer,
Seller, Mr. Rahr and the Company shall file (and Seller and Mr. Rahr shall
cause each Other Person to file) all Tax Returns and information reports in a
manner consistent with such Allocation Schedule, as finalized either by
failure of Seller to notify Buyer in writing within 30 calendar days
after receiving the Allocation Schedule of any dispute or by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this _Section 6.8(c)(ii)_.

 

(d) _Amended Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law,
none of the Company, Buyer or any Affiliate of the Company or Buyer shall (or
shall cause or permit the Company to) amend any Seller Pre-Closing Period
Return or Buyer Pre-Closing Period Return, without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Seller shall not amend any Tax Return of the Company without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer may amend or cause to be amended any
Straddle Period Return (an " _Amended Straddle Period Return_ "), provided
that such Amended Straddle Period Return be submitted to Seller not later than
30 days prior to the intended filing date (the " _Specified Filing Date_
") for review by Seller. Seller shall respond in writing to Buyer with any
comments at least 20 days prior to the Specified Filing Date. In the event
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such comments at least 10 days prior to
the Specified Filing Date for such Amended Straddle Period Return, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, prior to the Specified Filing Date for such Amended
Straddle Period Return. Buyer shall revise such Amended Straddle Period
Return (or shall cause such Amended Straddle Period Return to be revised) to
reflect the resolution by the Accounting Firm.

(e) _Tax Claim Notices; Tax Proceedings_.

(i) Any party that may be entitled to indemnification under _Section 6.8(h)_
(" _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly deliver to the party that may be
liable for such indemnification under Section 6.8(h) (" _Tax
Responsible Party_ ") (A) in the case of any Tax Proceeding that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to the right of indemnification under
_Section 6.8(h)_, written notice as soon as reasonably practicable of such
Tax Proceeding, together with a copy of the relevant portion of any written
communication received by the Tax Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
from a Governmental Authority concerning such Tax

 



-40-   Proceeding and (B) in the case of any Taxes shown as due on any Tax Return
for which the Tax Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification under _Section
6.8(h)_, written notice as soon as reasonably practicable of such Taxes,
together with a copy of the relevant portion of such Tax Return (it being
agreed and understood that Seller shall be deemed to have notice for all
purposes of this Agreement of any Taxes shown as due on any Tax Return filed
on or prior to the Closing Date or any Buyer Pre-Closing Period Return) (such
notice under clauses (A) or (B), a " _Tax Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to provide such Tax Claim Notice shall not
release the Tax Responsible Party from any of its indemnification obligations
under _Section 6.8(h)_ except to the extent the Tax Responsible Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(ii) If any Governmental Authority asserts a Tax Proceeding with respect to
the Company for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, that,
(A) if pursued successfully by the Governmental Authority, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to the right of indemnification under _Section 6.8(h)_
or (B) relates to an income Tax Return for a tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date and with respect to which Tax Return the Company was treated
as an S Corporation within the meaning of Section 1361 and 1362 of the Code
(or any similar provision of state or local law), Seller shall have the right
to control such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Seller shall
provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of
such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Seller shall consult with Buyer before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and
receive copies of any written materials relating to such Tax Proceeding
received from the relevant Governmental Authority, and (iv) Seller shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall have the exclusive right to
control (A) any Tax Proceeding not described in the foregoing sentence of this
_Section 6.8(e)(ii)_, including any Tax Proceeding that ceases to be
described in the foregoing sentence of this _Section 6.8(e)(ii)_ or (B) any
Tax Proceeding described in the foregoing sentence of this _Section
6.8(e)(ii)_ if Seller fails to defend such Tax Proceeding vigorously.

(f) _Straddle Periods_. Unless prohibited by applicable Tax Law, the Tax
period of the Company shall be closed as of the end of the Closing Date. In
any case where applicable Tax Law does not permit the Company to close its Tax
period on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a Straddle Period of the Company, then Taxes, if any, with respect
to a Straddle Period of the Company shall be allocated in the manner described
in this _Section 6.8(f)_. Taxes of the Company (other than Property Taxes and
Periodic Taxes) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date based on a "closing of the books" method, provided that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period.
Property Taxes and Periodic Taxes shall be allocated between the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period. If the Section 338(h)(10) Election is not made, the parties
agree to make the

 



-41-   election provided in Section 1362(e)(3) of the Code, if necessary, to avoid
the application of Section 1362(e)(2) of the Code.

 

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, Seller and the Company shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Tax Proceedings.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return or Tax Proceedings and making employees, agents or other
representatives, including the Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, Seller and the Company
agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if the other party so requests, the Company or Seller, as the
case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books
and records; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Seller shall not have any right to receive or obtain any information
relating to, or have any rights with respect to, any Taxes or Tax Return of
Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer (other than information relating solely to
the Company).

(h) _Tax Indemnification_.

warranty shall be deemed to be references to "material to the Company" and
(y) all references to "material" contained in such representation or warranty
(including references to "material to the Company" as a result of clause (x)
above) shall be taken into account solely for purposes of determining whether

shall be ignored); (D) Taxes arising from or in connection with any breach by
the Company or Seller of any of their covenants or agreements contained

Election and any election made or deemed made (to the extent required by Tax
Law) as a result of a Section 338(h)(10) Election. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 6.8(k)_ shall limit Buyers right or ability to make

regardless of whether such Section 338(h)(10) Election would result in a
Section 338(g) Election being made or deemed made.

 

Section 6.9. _Noncompete; Non-Solicit_.

(a) During the period beginning immediately after the Closing and ending on
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_
"), Seller and Mr. Rahr covenant and agree not to, and to cause their
respective Affiliates and Associates not to, directly or indirectly and
anywhere in the United States, conduct, manage, operate, engage in (whether as
an officer, director, owner, partner, stockholder, investor, consultant,
principal, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise), or have an ownership
interest in any business engaged in distributing pharmaceutical, over-the-
counter or health and beauty products or other merchandise traditionally
sold in community pharmacies (the " _Business_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) conducting, managing, operating, engaging in or having an ownership
in a business that derives less than 10% of its revenues from the
Business and (ii) ownership, as a passive investment, by Seller of 5% or less
of the outstanding stock of any publicly-traded company shall not violate the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_.

 



-43-  (b) During the Non-Compete Period, Seller and Mr. Rahr shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Associates not to, directly or
indirectly, call-on, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any
customer or supplier of Buyer or the Company for the provision of products or
services related to the Business or interfere or attempt to interfere with the
business relationships of Buyer or the Company with such customers or
suppliers or potential customers or suppliers.

 

(c) During the Non-Compete Period, except for the persons and only to the
extent listed on _Section 6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, Seller
and Mr. Rahr shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
Associates not to, directly or indirectly solicit or induce any employee of
Buyer or the Company to leave the employ of Buyer or the Company for any
reason whatsoever, nor shall Seller, Mr. Rahr or any of their respective
Affiliates offer or provide employment to or hire, either on a full-time basis
or part-time or consulting basis, any person who then currently is, or who
within six months immediately prior thereto was, an employee of Buyer or the
Company; _provided_ that this Section 6.9(c) shall not prohibit Seller, Mr.
Rahr or their respective Affiliates or Associates from hiring any person whose
employment with the Company or Buyer was terminated by Buyer.

(d) Seller and Mr. Rahr acknowledge and agree that the restrictive covenants
and other agreements contained in this _Section 6.9_ are an essential part of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, constitute a material
inducement to Buyers entering into and performing its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, are an essential part of
Buyers willingness to pay the Purchase Price and are necessary for Buyer to
realize the value of the Shares and the business of the Company. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time that is not permitted by Law, or is in any way construed to be too broad
or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null,
void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would then be valid or
enforceable under Law, such provision shall be construed and interpreted or
reformed to provide for a restriction or covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions as shall be
valid and enforceable under Law. Each of Seller and Mr. Rahr acknowledges that
the rights of Buyer under this _Section 6.9_ are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Seller, Mr. Rahr or
their Affiliates or Associates, money damages may be inadequate and the non-
breaching party may have no adequate remedy at Law.
Accordingly, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller and Mr. Rahr agree that Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and Sellers and Mr. Rahrs obligations hereunder not only
by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

Section 6.10. _Assets to be Removed_. The parties hereto agree that Seller
shall retain ownership of the assets identified on _Section 6.10_ of the

(b) except for items asterisked on Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (i) all Contracts between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any Related Party, on the other hand, and (ii) all Liabilities of the Company
to any Related Party (other than any such Contract with, or Liability to, any
officer, director, manager or employee of the Company pursuant to an agreement
set forth on _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or for
compensation in the ordinary course of business to such Person) will be
terminated, in each case prior to the Closing without any Liability to the
Company after the Closing (all Liabilities related to intercompany accounts
and Contracts described in _Section 6.11(a)_ or _6.11(c)_ , together with
all Liabilities related to the Excluded Assets, the " _Excluded Liabilities_
").

 

Section 6.12. _Resignations_. On or prior to the Closing Date, each of Seller
and the Company shall cause each officer and director or manager of the
Company, and each director, manager, non-corporate trustee or fiduciary of any
Employee Benefit Plan, as shall have been requested by Buyer at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing, to tender his or her resignation from
such position effective as of the Closing.

Section 6.13. _Financial Information Prior to the Closing_. Between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, Seller and the Company shall provide Buyer, no
later than 15 days after the last day of each calendar month an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of the last day of such calendar month and

month.

the request of the Chief Executive Officer of Cardinal Health, Inc., he will
be available at such times as are reasonably agreed by Buyer and Mr. Rahr to

connection with the post-Closing transition of the Company and the retention
of the Companys customers; _provided_ that in no event shall Mr.
Rahrs obligations to consult with or assist Buyer or the Company exceed 20
hours per month during the first 6 months following the Closing and 5 hours
per month for the next 6 months thereafter. For 4 months following the
Closing, the Company shall provide Mr. Rahr with the use of an office at the
Companys headquarters in Whitestone, New York.

 

Section 6.15. _Solicitation Confidentiality Agreements_. Seller and the
Company shall not amend, modify, supplement, or grant any consent or waiver
under or with respect to, any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements
entered into between Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
or representatives and any Person (other than Buyer) to whom confidential
information was provided in connection with the possible sale of the Company
or other transaction involving the assets of the Company (the " _Solicitation
Confidentiality Agreements_ "). Seller and the Company shall as promptly as
practicable request and use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person to

the claim, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, a good-faith
reasonable estimate of the Loss and method of computation thereof, to the
extent then reasonably estimable, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises (it being agreed that the failure to specify any
provision of this Agreement in such Claim Notice shall not preclude the
Indemnified Party from asserting that there has been a breach of, or
inaccuracy in, or failure to perform such provision); provided that the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
materially prejudiced thereby. With respect to any recovery or indemnification
sought by an Indemnified Party from the Responsible Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim (as defined below), if the Responsible Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice that the Responsible Party disputes such claim (the " _Dispute Notice_
"), the Responsible Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with
such claim. If the Responsible Party has disputed a claim for indemnification
under

 



-51-    _Section 9.2_ (including any Third-Party Claim), the Responsible Party and
the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to
such dispute. If the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party cannot
resolve such dispute in 30 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.15_.

 

(b) If a Proceeding (other than a Tax Proceeding) by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") is made against any Indemnified Party, and if such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under Section
9.2, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Responsible Party of
such claims; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Other than in connection
with a Third Party Claim by a Governmental Authority, the Responsible Party
shall have 90 days after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith;
_provided_ that the Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such
Indemnified Party,  _provided_ that, the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by such Indemnified Party. So long as the Responsible Party is
reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party
shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in such event it shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party or from the Escrow Account, as
the case may be, for such claim unless the Responsible Party shall have
consented to such payment or settlement. If the Responsible Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 90 days after the receipt of the
Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects
to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Responsible Party
shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any
settlement that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all Indemnified
Parties of an unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment, (ii) does not involve only the
payment of money damages, (iii) imposes an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party or (iv) includes any admission of wrongdoing
or misconduct by the Indemnified Party.

(c) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of
any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal
business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents and
representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party as
being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

 



-52-  Section 9.4.  _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 9.2_ are subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) The amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of (i) any
accruals or reserves on the Recent Balance Sheet, (ii) any amounts actually
recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may
be, under indemnification agreements or arrangements with third parties or
under insurance policies with respect to such Losses (and no right of
subrogation shall accrue to any such third party indemnitor or insurer
hereunder) (each such source named in this clause (ii) a " _Collateral Source_
"). Seller or Buyer may, in its sole discretion, require any
Indemnified Party to grant an assignment of the right of such Indemnified
Party to assert a claim against any Collateral Source, to the extent the
Indemnified Party is permitted to grant such assignment under the applicable
indemnification agreement or arrangement or insurance policy. If the amount
to be netted hereunder from any payment required under _Sections 9.2(a)_ or
_9.2(b)_ is determined after payment of any amount otherwise required to be
paid to an Indemnified Party under this  _Article IX_ , the Indemnified Party
shall repay to the Responsible Parties, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the Responsible Parties would not have had to pay pursuant to this
_Article IX_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

(b) The amount of any Loss will be determined (i) net of an amount equal to
the Tax benefits actually realized in cash by the Buyer Indemnitees or the
Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, in the year during which such Loss was
suffered and arising from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Loss
and (ii) taking into account any Tax cost actually incurred or suffered by
the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, arising from
the receipt or accrual of the indemnification payment.

 

(c) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under _Section
9.2_ that portion of any Loss solely to the extent specifically reflected and
identified as such in the calculation of Net Working Capital.

(d) The Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be,
shall not be entitled to recover for any particular Loss pursuant to _Section
6.8(h)(i)(C)_, _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, as the case may
be, unless such Loss (or series of related Losses) equals or exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
limitation shall not apply to Losses in respect of claims for breach of
representations and warranties related to  _Section 4.5_ or pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_, _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 9.2(b)(iii)_.

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, will
not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_, or  _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be, until the total
amount which the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may
be, would recover under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or 
_Section 9.2(b)(i)_, as the case may be (as limited by the provisions of
_Sections 9.4(a)_ through _9.4(d)_ ), but for this _Section 9.4(e)_, exceeds
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the " _Threshold_ ") and then only for the
excess over the Threshold; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Threshold shall
not apply to Losses in respect of claims for breach of representations and
warranties related to 

 



-53-    _Section 4.5_ or pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, _Section
9.2(a)(iv)_, _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(iii)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the maximum aggregate
obligation of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for (i) breaches of
covenants and agreements under _Section 6.8(h)(i)(D)_ (and to the extent
relating thereto, _Section 6.8(h)(i)(E)_), _Section 6.8(h)(ii)(A)_ (and to
the extent relating thereto,  _Section 6.8(h)(ii)(C)_), _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section
9.2(b)(iii)_ and (ii) claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_
for Losses in respect of claims for breach of representations and warranties
related to _Section 4.5_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price and (B) the
maximum aggregate obligation of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for
claims for indemnification under _Section 6.8(h)(i)_ (other than _Section
6.8(h)(i)(D)_ (and to the extent relating thereto, _Section 6.8(h)(i)(E)_)
and Section 6.8(h)(ii) (other than Section 6.8(h)(ii)(A) (and to the extent
relating thereto, _Section 6.8(h)(ii)(C)_)) shall not exceed Five Hundred
Million Dollars ($500,000,000).

 

(g) Except with respect to claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_
for breach of representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_,
which indemnification shall be limited as set forth in _Section 9.4(f)_, at
no time will the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than Ninety
Million Dollars ($90,000,000) pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_, and at no time will the Seller Indemnitees be entitled to recover
more than Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000) pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)(i)_.

 

(h) To the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification
payments from Seller for claims for indemnification under  _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ other than claims for indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ in respect of a breach of representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_, such indemnification payments shall
be disbursed to such Buyer Indemnitee from the Escrow Funds to the extent
sufficient funds are available from the Escrow Funds, with any deficiency
being paid by Seller.

 

(i) To the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification
payments from Seller under _Section 6.8(h)_, under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ in
respect of claims for a breach of representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.5,_ under _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ or under _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_
then, in each such case, any such Losses may be satisfied, at Buyers option,
by the amount of cash in the Escrow Account, with any deficiency being paid by
Seller.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in
_Section 9.4_ shall limit any Persons rights to recovery in respect of fraud
or willful misconduct.

 

(k) For purposes of _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ , _9.2(a)(ii)_ and _9.2(b)(i)_ only:
(i) all references to "Material Adverse Effect" contained in the Companys or
the Sellers representations and warranties in _Article III_ and _Article IV_
hereof (other than in _Section 3.7_) shall be deemed to be references to
"material to the Company"; and (ii) all references to "material" contained in
the Companys or the Sellers representations and warranties in _Article III_
and _Article IV_ hereof (including references to "material to the Company" as
a result of clause (i) of this _Section 9.4(k)_) and any references to
"Material Adverse Effect" contained in the Companys and Sellers
representations and warranties in  _Section 3.7_ hereof shall be taken into
account solely for purposes of determining whether such representations or
warranties have been

 



-54-   breached or violated, but not for purposes of determining of calculating the
Loss resulting from such breach or violation or for purposes of determining
whether the Threshold has been exceeded (it being agreed that, for both of
such purposes, all qualifications as to Material Adverse Effect and
materiality contained in the Companys or the Sellers representations and
warranties shall be ignored).

 

Section 9.5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, other than Buyer and the
Companys right to specifically enforce the obligations of Seller and Mr. Rahr
under _Section 6.9_ and other than claims of and causes of action arising
from fraud or willful misconduct, indemnification pursuant to _Section
6.8(h)_ and _Sections 9.2(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be the exclusive remedy for the
parties hereto for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant
or other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto and with respect to any and all claims by Buyer
Indemnitees relating to this Agreement, the Company, the events giving rise to
or the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, as a
material inducement to the other parties hereto entering into this Agreement,
and subject to Buyer and the Companys right to specifically enforce the
obligations of Seller and Mr. Rahr under _Section 6.9_, Buyer and Seller
hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any claim or cause of action, known
and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which it or any of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, with respect to Buyer, the Company)
may have against the other parties hereto, including without limitation under
the common law or federal or state securities Laws, trade regulation Laws or
other Laws (including any relating to Tax, environmental or employee
matters), by reason of this Agreement, the events giving rise to or the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for claims or causes of action (i) brought under _Section 6.8(h)_
(only to the extent expressly provided in _Section 6.8(i)_, subject to the
terms and conditions of the provisions contained in this _Article IX_ ) or
under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(b)_  (subject to the terms and conditions of
the provisions contained in this _Article IX),_ (ii) arising from fraud or
willful misconduct or (iii) arising under any covenant or agreement to be
performed after the Closing under this Agreement, including under _Section
6.9_, or under any other Transaction Document.

hereto (as provided above) from time to time.

Section 10.2. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All exhibits and schedules hereto, or
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full
in this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, any matter that is
disclosed in a Section of a Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to have been
included in the other Sections of such Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding the
omission of a cross-reference thereto, to the extent that such disclosure is
sufficient so that the applicability of such disclosure to a section is
reasonably apparent on its face to a reader of such disclosure. Disclosure of
any fact or item in any Section of a Disclosure Letter shall not necessarily
mean that such fact or item is material to the Company, Seller or Buyer.

Section 10.3. _Time of the Essence; Computation of Time_. Time is of the
essence for each and every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day
for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder
shall fall upon a Saturday, Sunday, or any date on which banks in New York

Section 10.4. _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for
in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each

transactions contemplated herein. Buyer understands and acknowledges that all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or to be incurred

 



-57-   by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the Company Expenses) will be paid by the
Company prior to the Closing.

 

Section 10.5. _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") imposed on the sale or transfer of the Shares to Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller. The party
required by Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall, with the cooperation of the other party, prepare and file (or cause to
be prepared and filed) such Tax Returns and provide the other party with a
copy of such Tax Return (and all parties shall execute such Tax Returns to the
extent required by applicable law).

 

Section 10.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of New York,
without reference to the choice of law or conflicts of law principles thereof.
The parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and in the absence of such Federal jurisdiction, the parties consent
to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in New
York City, and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or
subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any
Proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties (i) waives
the defense of inconvenient forum, (ii) agrees not to commence any Proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby other
than in any such court, and (iii) agrees that a final judgment in any
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

Section 10.7. _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation of
Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void;
_provided_ that Buyer may assign any or all of its respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall release Buyer from any
liability or obligation under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal
representatives. Except as set forth in _Section 6.7_,  _Section 9.1_ and
_Section 9.2_ hereof, this Agreement shall be for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their respective heirs, successors, permitted
assigns and legal representatives and is not intended, nor shall be
construed, to give any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors, assigns and legal representatives, any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder.

 

Section 10.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile or by electronic communications in portable
document format (.pdf) shall be effective as delivery of a mutually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

 



-58-  Section 10.9.  _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of
contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in
any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
the Disclosure Letters, the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the matters covered hereby and supersedes all previous
written, oral or implied understandings among them with respect to such
matters.

Section 10.11. _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement
of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced
to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

Section 10.12. _No Strict Construction_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that this Agreement has been prepared jointly by the parties
hereto, and shall not be strictly construed against any other party. As a
consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of any Laws or
rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any
particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive
their effects.

Section 10.13. _Certain Understandings_. Each of the parties is a
sophisticated legal entity or Person that was advised by experienced counsel
and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in connection with
this Agreement. Accordingly, each of the parties hereby acknowledges that (i)
no party has relied or will rely in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby upon any document or written or oral
information previously furnished to or discovered by it or its
representatives, other than as set forth in this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Letters), (ii) there are no representations or warranties by or on
behalf of any party hereto or any of its affiliates or representatives other
than those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in certificates delivered
by the parties pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, and (iii) the
parties respective rights and obligations with respect to this Agreement and
the events giving rise thereto will be solely as set forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.14. _Specific Performance_. Each of Seller, the Company and Buyer
acknowledges that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event
of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate
and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly,
the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in
equity, to enforce its rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not
only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security). Buyer acknowledges that prior to the
Closing, the Company will have the right to specifically enforce the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
terms and pursuant to the conditions of this Agreement; and Seller and the
Company acknowledge that prior to the Closing, Buyer will have the right to
specifically enforce the obligation of Seller and the Company to consummate

 



-59-   the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and pursuant to the
conditions of this Agreement and that from and after the Closing, Buyer and
the Company will have the right to specifically enforce the obligations of
Seller and Mr. Rahr under _Section 6.9_ of this Agreement.

Section 10.15.  _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.2_ and _10.15(k)_ , the parties desire to
resolve disputes arising out of this Agreement without litigation.
Accordingly, except as provided in (i) _Section 10.15(k)_ for actions to
seek temporary restraining orders or injunctions or other equitable remedies
related to the purposes of this Agreement, or suits to compel compliance with
the dispute resolution provision or (ii) _Sections 2.2(c)(ii)_ , _6.8(a)(ii)_
and _6.8(c)(ii)_ for disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm, the
parties agree to use the following alternative dispute procedure exclusively
with respect to any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or its breach.

(b) At the written request of a party, each party shall appoint a
knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith
to resolve any dispute arising under this Agreement. The parties intend that
these negotiations be conducted by non-lawyer, business representatives. The
location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these discussions
shall be left to the discretion of the representatives.

 

(c) Upon agreement between the parties, the representatives may utilize other
alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation to assist in the
negotiations.

(d) If the negotiations do not resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days
after the initial written request pursuant to _Section 10.15(b)_, the
dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a panel of three neutral
arbitrators pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ").

(e) The parties shall contract with the arbitrators to commence the
arbitration hearing within thirty (30) days of the demand for arbitration
pursuant to _Section 10.15(d)_; provided, however, that if the parties cannot
agree on the arbitrators within such thirty (30) day period, the arbitrators
shall be selected by the New York, New York office of the AAA or, if such
office does not exist or is unable to make the selections, by the office of
the AAA nearest to New York, New York. Each arbitrator shall be a lawyer
knowledgeable and experienced in the applicable Laws concerning the subject
matter of the dispute. In any case no arbitrator shall be an Affiliate,
employee, consultant, officer, director or stockholder of any party, or
otherwise have any current or previous relationship with either party
or their respective Affiliates. The governing Law in _Section 10.6_ shall
govern any such Proceedings. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New
York (or other mutually acceptable site). Any arbitration award may be entered
in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction.

(f) Immediately upon the designation of the arbitrators, the parties may
serve upon each other ten (10) interrogatories and fifteen (15) requests for
documents. Responses to such written discovery will be due within thirty (30)
days of service. In addition, each party shall be entitled to take up to
three depositions, to be conducted consistent with Rule 30 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Any disputes regarding such discovery shall be
resolved by

 



-60-   the arbitrator, based upon letter briefing not to exceed three (3) single-
spaced pages. The arbitrators may, in their discretion, hold a telephonic
hearing on any such discovery disputes. No other discovery beyond that
described in this paragraph will be permitted. Within sixty (60) days after
the designation of the arbitrators, the parties shall submit to the
arbitrators a pre-hearing brief, which brief shall include a summary of all
disputed issues, such partys position on such disputed issues and such
partys proposed ruling on the merits of each such issue.

(g) The arbitrators shall set a date for a hearing, which shall be no later
than thirty (30) days after the submission of written briefs pursuant to
_Section 10.15(f)_, or, if the arbitrators cannot set the hearing within
thirty (30) days after the submission of written briefs pursuant to _Section
10.15(f)_, shall set a date for hearing as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, for the presentation of evidence and legal argument concerning
each of the issues identified by the parties. The parties shall have the right
to be represented by counsel. Except as provided herein, the arbitration shall
be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA applicable at the
time the demand for arbitration pursuant to _Section 10.15(d)_ is made;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the arbitrators may in their discretion apply
the Federal Rules of Evidence with regard to the admissibility of evidence in
such hearing.

(h) The arbitrators shall use their best efforts to rule on each disputed
issue within thirty (30) days after completion of the hearing described in
_Section 10.15(g)_. The determination of the majority of the arbitrators as
to the resolution of any dispute or any other decision to be made by the
arbitrators shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties. All rulings of
the arbitrators shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties
except to the extent that the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA provide
otherwise.

 

(i) If arbitrated, the arbitrators shall be given the authority to award fees
and costs to the prevailing party or as otherwise determined by the
arbitrators.

(j) The expenses of any arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to
such arbitration, provided that each party shall pay for and bear the cost of
its own experts, evidence and legal counsel.

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.15_ to the contrary, each
party shall have the right to seek such injunctive or other equitable relief
pursuant to _Section 10.14_ from a court of competent jurisdiction as may be
necessary to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the status quo or preserve the
subject matter of the arbitration.

Section 10.16. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto waives any
right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on,
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any course of
conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of any
party hereto.

Section 10.17. _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach
of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise

 



-61-   thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 

Section 10.18. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the Closing, by action taken by Seller and the Company and Buyer, and
after the Closing by Buyer and Seller. This Agreement (including the
provisions of this _Section 10.18_) may not be amended or modified except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties required
pursuant to the preceding sentence.

Section 10.19. _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges that Fossi and Jewell and Dechert LLP (" _Dechert_ ") currently
serves as counsel to both (a) the Company and (b) Mr. Rahr, including in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There may come a time, including
after consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, when
the interests of Mr. Rahr and the Company may no longer be aligned or when,
for any reason, Mr. Rahr, Fossi and Jewell, Dechert or the Company believes that
Fossi and Jewell or Dechert cannot or should no longer represent both Mr. Rahr
and the Company. The parties understand and specifically agree that Fossi and
Jewell or Dechert may withdraw from representing the Company and continue to
represent Mr. Rahr, even if the interests of Mr. Rahr, and the interests of
the Company are or may be adverse, including in connection with any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and even though Fossi and Jewell or Dechert may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute or
may be handling ongoing matters for the Company or any of its Affiliates, and
Buyer and the Company hereby consent thereto and waive any conflict
of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties further agrees that, as to
all communications among Fossi and Jewell, Dechert, the Company, Seller and Mr.
Rahr, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and
all other rights to any evidentiary privilege shall be subject to a shared
privilege between Mr. Rahr, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, and Mr. Rahr and the Company shall have equal right to assert all such
shared privileges in connection with privileged information under any
applicable Law and no such shared privilege may be waived by (a) Mr. Rahr
without the prior written consent of the Company; or (b) by the Company
without the prior written consent of Mr. Rahr; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any information relating to or arising out of any legal advice provided,
whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect to any matter for which
Buyer or Seller has an indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be subject
to the sole and separate privilege of the indemnifying party, and such
indemnifying party shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver of all
such separate privileges under any applicable Law in connection with any
privileged information, whether or not such information is in the possession
of or under the control of any of the Indemnified Parties; _provided_ ,
_further_ , however, that nothing in this  _Section 10.19_ shall in any way
limit Buyers ability to use and access any information related to the
business of the Company.

ARTICLE XI.

LIMITED GUARANTEE

 



-62-  Section 11.1.  _Limited Guarantee_. In order to induce Buyer to enter into
this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, Mr. Rahr (the "
_Guarantor_ "), hereby irrevocably guarantees, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 11.1_, the payment of the obligations of Seller
contained in _Article IX_ in connection with a breach of Sellers
representations and warranties in _Section 4.5_ (Ownership of Shares) (the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ "); it being agreed that without the prior written
consent of Buyer, Seller or the Guarantor shall not have a right to satisfy
the Guaranteed Obligations from the Escrow Funds or pursuant to any set-off of
any amounts payable under this Agreement, and Buyer shall not be required to
seek recovery from the Escrow Funds or pursuant to any set-off of any amounts
payable under this Agreement prior to seeking recovery from the Guarantor
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 11.1_. Buyer may (on behalf of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties), at its sole option, elect to assert a claim
pursuant to this _Article XI_ against Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations concurrently with or following the assertion of a claim against
Seller with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; _provided_ that in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Guarantors Liability pursuant to this _Article
XI_ exceed the Purchase Price, and in no event shall Buyer be entitled to any
payment hereunder to the extent that such payment would constitute a
duplicative payment for the same Loss. In the event that Seller is dissolved,
revoked or is otherwise, for any reason, unable or unwilling to financially
satisfy any or all of its indemnification obligations contained in _Section
6.8(h)_ and _Article IX_ , Guarantor shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates with a financial credit and assets equal to or greater than Seller
as of immediately after the Closing, to satisfy such obligations. Any payment
by Guarantor pursuant to this _Section 11.1_ shall, for all purposes of
_Section 9.4_, be deemed to be a payment by Seller in respect of Sellers
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_. The Guarantor
hereby acknowledges that by reason of his relationship with Seller and the
Company, the Guarantor will derive a substantial benefit from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Guarantor hereby further
acknowledges that the validity of this _Article XI_ and the Guarantors
obligations under this _Article XI_ shall not be affected or impaired by
reason of any amendment, waiver, indulgence, forbearance or other variance by
Buyer under or in respect of this Agreement, or any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other such Proceeding relating to Seller or the Company.
Nothing set forth in this  _Section 11.1_ confers or gives, or shall be
construed to confer or give (i) to any Person other than Buyer (and any Buyer
Indemnitee on whose behalf Buyer may act) any remedies under or by reason of
the obligations of the Guarantor set forth in this _Section 11.1_ or (ii) to
any Person any rights or remedies against any Person other than the Guarantor
under or by reason of the obligations of the Guarantor set forth in this
_Section 11.1_.

 

Section 11.2. _Notice to Guarantor_. Any notice, request, instruction or other
document to be given hereunder to the Guarantor shall be addressed as
