MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as
of the 7th day of April, 2017 (the "Execution Date"), by and among (i) Uniti
Fiber Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), (ii) Uniti Group
Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Parent"), and (iii) SLF Holdings, LLC, an
Alabama limited liability company (the "Seller"). Unless otherwise set forth
herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given to such
terms in Exhibit A hereto.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding membership
interests (the "Membership Interests") of the Company;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to contribute the Contributed Membership
Interests to the Operating Partnership, a Subsidiary of Parent to be formed
prior to Closing as contemplated by the UPREIT Transactions, and in respect of
such contribution, the Parent desires to cause the Operating Partnership to
issue to the Seller the number of OP Common Units as set forth in Article 2
hereof, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this
Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell all of the Purchased Membership Interests
to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to purchase all of the Purchased
Membership Interests from the Seller, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as an inducement and condition to Parent's and Buyer's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) is entering into offer
letters (the "Offer Letters") and restrictive covenant agreements (the
"Restrictive Covenant Agreements") with each of Andy Newton, Eric Daniels and
Paul Bullington, which Offer Letters and Restrictive Covenant Agreements shall
be effective as of, and contingent on, the Closing.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements set
forth herein, the Parent, the Buyer and the Seller agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
 Contemplated Transactions

  



  

Section 1.1.   _Agreement to Contribute and Sell Membership
Interests; Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Closing:

  



  

(a)  the Seller agrees to contribute to the Operating Partnership,
and Parent agrees to cause the Operating Partnership to accept from the
Seller, the Contributed Membership Interests free and clear of any and all
Liens, in exchange for the issuance by the Operating Partnership of the
Closing Date Equity Consideration; and

  



    



 



    

(b)  the Seller agrees to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer agrees
to purchase from the Seller all of the Purchased Membership Interests free
and clear of any and all Liens, in exchange for the payment of an aggregate
purchase price equal to (i) the Closing Date Cash Consideration _plus_ (ii)
any amounts paid to the Seller out of the Holdback Funds in accordance with
the terms hereof.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the Closing Date Equity Consideration,
together with the Closing Date Cash Consideration and any amounts paid to the
Seller out of the Holdback Funds shall be known as the "Purchase Price." The
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Section
1.2(f) and Article 10.

  



  

Section 1.2.   _Adjustment to Purchase Price._

  



  

(a)  No later than the close of business of the sixth (6th)
Business Day preceding the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare in good
faith, at the Seller's expense, and deliver to the Buyer a written statement
setting forth: (i) a balance sheet of the Company (the "Preliminary Balance
Sheet"), (ii) the Seller's good-faith calculations (in reasonable detail) of
the estimated Net Working Capital of the Company (the "Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital") and the estimated Net Indebtedness of the Company (the
"Estimated Closing Date Net Indebtedness") and (iii) on the basis of the
foregoing, a calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (together
with the balance sheet referred to in clause (i) and the calculations
referred to in clause (ii) above, the "Preliminary Closing Statement"), in
each case, (x) as of the close of business on the Closing Date without giving
effect to the payments to be made in connection with the Closing and (y) in
the case of the Preliminary Balance Sheet and the calculation of Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Policies. When the Seller delivers the Preliminary Closing Statement,
the Seller shall also deliver to the Buyer a certificate signed by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Seller, acting in such capacity, certifying that the
Preliminary Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 1.2(a). In the event that Buyer notifies the Seller
of any objection (which objections, if any, may reference only
disagreements (A) based on mathematical errors or (B) regarding whether the
Estimated Closing Date Consideration, or the components thereof, as reflected
on the Preliminary Closing Statement were calculated in accordance with this
Section 1.2 and the applicable definitions) to the Preliminary Closing
Statement no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Seller shall discuss such objections in good faith and the
Seller will, in good faith and after taking into account the
discussion between the Seller and the Buyer, revise and re-deliver the
Preliminary Closing Statement no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing to reflect the results of such discussion (which revised and
redelivered Preliminary Closing Statement shall serve as the Preliminary
Closing Statement for all purposes under this Agreement). Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company to, promptly provide all supporting documentation
reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with the Buyer and
Parent's review of the Preliminary Closing Statement.

  



  

(b)  The "Estimated Closing Date Consideration" shall be equal to
(i) the Enterprise Value, _minus_  (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Net
Indebtedness, _minus_ (iii) the

  



    

 2

 



    

amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Net Working Capital, _plus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by
which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than the
Target Net Working Capital, each as calculated by the Seller pursuant to the
Preliminary Closing Statement.

  



  

(c)  Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at the Buyer's expense, and deliver to
the Seller a written statement setting forth, (i) a balance sheet of the
Company (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) the Buyer's good faith
calculations in reasonable detail of the Net Working Capital of the Company
(the "Closing Date Net Working Capital") and the Net Indebtedness of the
Company (the "Closing Date Net Indebtedness") and (iii) on the basis of the
foregoing, a calculation of the Closing Date Consideration (together with the
balance sheet referred to in clause (i) above and the calculations referred to
in clause (ii) above, the "Final Closing Statement"), in each case, (x) as of
the close of business on the Closing Date without giving effect to
the payments to be made in connection with the Closing and (y) in the case of
the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Date Net Working Capital, prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Policies. In the event that the Buyer shall
fail to deliver the Final Closing Statement within the 45-day period provided
in this paragraph (c), at the Seller's option, the Preliminary
Closing Statement delivered in accordance with Section 1.2(a) will be treated
as the Final Closing Statement for all purposes hereof.

  



  

(d)  When the Buyer delivers the Final Closing Statement, the
Buyer shall also deliver to the Seller a certificate signed by an executive
officer of the Buyer, acting in such capacity, certifying that the Final
Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 1.2(c) above. During the forty-five (45)-day period immediately
following the Seller's receipt of the Final Closing Statement, or in the
event Buyer fails to deliver the Final Closing Statement within the forty-
five (45)-day period provided in Section 1.2(c), the forty-five (45)-day
period immediately following the expiration of such forty-five (45)-day
period, the Seller and its representatives (i) will be permitted to review,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, the Company's books
and records and, subject to execution of customary access letters with
respect thereto, the working papers related to the preparation of the Final
Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein), and (ii)
will be given reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to knowledgeable employees of the Company in order to
facilitate the Seller's review of the Final Closing Statement. The Final
Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) will become
final, binding and conclusive upon the Buyer and the Seller (a) on the forty-
fifth (45th) day following the Seller's receipt thereof unless the Buyer
receives from the Seller prior to such forty-fifth (45th)-day written notice
of the Seller's disagreement (a "Dispute Notice") with any amount or
determination set forth in the Final Closing Statement, or (b) on such earlier
date as the Seller notifies the Buyer that it does not dispute the Final
Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice will specify in reasonable detail the
nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted (collectively, the
"Disputed Items") and contain reasonably detailed supporting documentation.
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Final Closing Statement other than the Disputed Items, which
items and

  



    

 3

 



    

amounts (other than Disputed Items) shall be final, binding and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder. If the Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice,
then the determination of the Closing Date Consideration (in accordance with
the resolution described in clause (x) or (y) below, as applicable) will
become final, binding and conclusive upon the Buyer and the Seller on the
first to occur of (x) the date on which the Buyer and the Seller resolve in
writing all differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y)
the date on which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by the Buyer
and the Seller in writing are finally resolved in writing by the Independent
Accountants in accordance with Section 1.2(e). Any Dispute Notice may
reference only disagreements (I) based on mathematical errors or (II)
regarding whether the Closing Date Consideration, or the components
thereof, as reflected on the Final Closing Statement were calculated in
accordance with this Section 1.2 and the applicable definitions.

  



  

(e)  During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Dispute
Notice, the Buyer and the Seller will seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they have with respect to all of the Disputed
Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing by the Buyer and the Seller will
be deemed final, binding and conclusive on the Buyer and the Seller. If the
Buyer and the Seller do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items
during such 30-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually
agree), then at the end of such 30-day (or such longer) period the Buyer and
the Seller will submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the
"Unresolved Items") to Deloitte LLP or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to
serve, such other independent national accounting firm as the parties hereto
may reasonably agree (the "Independent Accountants") to review and resolve
such matters. In making such determination, the Independent Accountants shall
consider only the Unresolved Items and shall base its determination solely on
the definitions and other applicable provisions of this Agreement (and not on
independent review). In resolving any Unresolved Item, the Independent
Accountants shall limit their determination to selecting whether the Buyer's
proposed amount for such item in the Final Closing Statement or the Seller's
proposed amount for such item in the Dispute Notice is calculated more nearly
in accordance with this Agreement. The proposed amount so selected by the
Independent Accountants shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be the
Independent Accountants' determination of such Unresolved Item, and the
Independent Accountants shall deliver a written report setting forth such
determination (and the basis therefor), as promptly as may be reasonably
practicable, and the Buyer and the Seller will instruct the Independent
Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more
than thirty (30) days following the appointment of the Independent
Accountants; _provided _ that the failure of the Independent Accountants to
do so within such thirty (30) day period shall not render the
determination of the Independent Accountant invalid and shall not serve as a
basis for seeking to overturn any determination of the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountants may conduct such
proceedings as the Independent Accountants believe, in their sole
discretion, will assist in such determination with respect to the Unresolved
Items; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as the Buyer and the Seller may
otherwise agree, (i) the Independent Accountants shall not be entitled to hold
any hearings or take or order the taking of any depositions or other
testimony under oath and (ii) all communications between the Buyer and the
Seller or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the
Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in writing with copies

  



    

 4

 



    

simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. The Independent
Accountants' determination of the Unresolved Items will be final, binding and
conclusive on the Buyer and the Seller, effective as of the date the
Independent Accountants' written determination is received by the Buyer and
the Seller, absent fraud or manifest error. Each of the Buyer and the Seller
will bear its own legal, accounting and other fees and expenses of
participating in such dispute resolution procedure. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be paid jointly, one-half by the Seller and
one-half by the Buyer.

  



  

(f)  Upon the determination, in accordance with Sections 1.2(c),
(d) and (e) above, of the Final Closing Statement and the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, the Closing Date Net Indebtedness and the Closing Date
Consideration, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows: (i) if the Estimated Closing Date Consideration is greater than the
Closing Date Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.2,
then the Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to the Buyer, and (ii) if
the Estimated Closing Date Consideration is less than the Closing Date
Consideration as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.2, then the
Buyer shall pay the amount of such deficiency to the Seller. Any payment
under this Section 1.2(f) shall be made in cash, without interest, within
three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Closing Date
Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.2, with any required payment by the

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Law affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such

  



    

 8

 



    

enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). No votes,
approvals, consents or proceedings of the holders of Seller's capital stock
are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of, or the

the Buyer will have good, valid and marketable title to and record and
beneficial ownership of the Membership Interests, free and clear of any Lien,

hereto are made, given or obtained, as applicable, neither the execution and

applicable, nor the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Seller or the Company, as applicable, of
the transactions contemplated thereby will (with or without the passage of
time or the giving of notice) constitute a violation of, or be in conflict
with, or constitute or create a default under, or result in the creation or

loss of any benefit to which the Company is entitled pursuant to, or create or
trigger any payment obligation for the account of the Company under: (i) the

Statements"), and (2) the audited balance sheet of the Company as of December
31, 2015 and the related audited statement of income, comprehensive income,
changes in member's equity/deficit and cash flows for the year ending
December 31, 2015 (such financial statements set forth in (1) and (2),

(a)  All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf
of the Company have been filed with the appropriate Governmental Authorities
when due (taking into account any applicable extensions). The Tax Returns
filed by or on behalf of the Company are complete and accurate in all
material respects, and all Taxes required to be reflected in any such Tax
Return were properly reflected therein. No waiver of any statute of
limitations relating to Taxes has been executed or given by the Company that
is currently in effect. All Taxes imposed upon the Company or upon any of its
properties, assets, revenues, income, and franchises have been paid, or
withheld or remitted, to the appropriate government agencies other than those
currently payable without penalty or interest or that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings that permit such contest without
payment.

  



  

(b)  All Tax Returns of the Company filed through the Tax year
ended December 31, 2012 have been examined and closed or are Tax returns with
respect to which the applicable period for assessment has expired under
Applicable Law, after giving effect to extensions and waivers. Neither the
Company nor any Affiliate of the Company has granted any extensions or waivers
of the statute of limitations period

  



    

 12

 



    

applicable to any Tax Return of the Company, which period (after giving
effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired. No Tax Return of the
Company is currently the subject of any claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation in respect of any Tax. No Taxing Authority is now asserting
or, to the Seller's knowledge, has threatened, in writing, to assert against
the Company any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes. No adjustment that
would increase the Tax liability of the Company has been threatened, proposed
or made of a Pre-Closing Tax Period which could reasonably be expected to be
threatened, proposed or made in an audit of any subsequent Tax period.

  



  

(c)  Schedule 3.9(c) contains a list of all jurisdictions in which
the Company files a Tax Return. In the past five taxable years, neither the
Company nor any Affiliate of the Company has received a written Tax opinion
with respect to any transaction relating to the Company, other than a
transaction in the ordinary course of business. No claim has been made in
writing by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not
file Tax Returns that the Company is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction.

  



  

(d)  There are no requests for rulings or determinations in
respect of any Tax pending between the Company and any Taxing Authority and
the Company has not received a ruling with respect to any Tax from any Taxing
Authority. The Company has not entered into any agreement or arrangement with
any Taxing Authority with regard to the Tax liability of the Company affecting
any Tax period for which the applicable statute of limitations has not
expired (after giving effect to extensions or waivers).

  



  

(e)  The Company will not be required to include in or for, or
allocate with respect to, a Post-Closing Tax Period, taxable income
attributable to income economically realized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and
no deduction economically attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period has been
claimed in a Pre-Closing Tax Period).

  



  

(f)  The Company is not liable for the Taxes of any Person as a
result of transferee liability, successor liability, joint and/or several
liability, contractual liability, or pursuant to any Law, rule or regulation
or otherwise, including any liability under any Tax sharing, Tax allocation,
Tax gross-up or similar agreement or arrangement, other than pursuant to
Contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and the primary
subject of which is not Taxes.

  



  

(g)  The Company is not a party to any understanding or
arrangement described in Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code, and has not
participated in a "reportable transaction."

  



  

(h)  The Company does not own an interest in real property in any
jurisdiction in which a Tax is imposed, or the value of the interest is
reassessed, on the transfer of an interest in real property and which treats
the transfer of an interest in an entity that owns an interest in real
property as a transfer of the interest in real property. None of the property
owned by the Company is "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of
Section 168(h) of the Code.

  



    

 13

 



    

(i)  The Company has not received any Tax Grants.

  



  

(j)  The Company is, and has been since December 12, 2007,
disregarded as an entity separate from the Seller for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes and has never filed an election to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 or
otherwise changed its classification for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. No
Tax Return has been filed in any jurisdiction in which the Company was
treated other than as an entity disregarded as separate from the Seller, or a
partnership for periods prior to December 12, 2007 for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

contingent, known or unknown or otherwise, except for: (i) liabilities
expressly described and adequately accrued and reserved against in accordance

 14

 



    

to the terms of any existing written agreement or plan or as required by
applicable Law or annual or periodic base salary increases made to employees
other than directors or officers in the ordinary course of business consistent
with the Company's past practices), or entry into, adoption, or amendment or
any employment, change in control or severance agreement;

  



  

(h)  any action taken by the Company or the Seller that, if taken

foregoing.

hereto, there are no Actions pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving the Seller or the Company, or any present or
former officer, director or employee of the Seller or the Company, or any
other Person for whom the Company may be liable that, if determined or
resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiff's demands, would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to

alter or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated

against the other party thereto except to the extent that enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity and (iv) is
in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the
Seller, any other party thereto is in material default under any Material
Contract and Material Network Agreement, nor has there occurred any event
that with notice or lapse of time, or both, (A) would constitute a
material default by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Seller, any other
party thereunder, (B) would allow or give rise to the limitation, revocation,
modification, or termination of any Material Contract or Material Network

through (C). There is no pending disagreement or dispute with any other party
to any Material Contract or Material Network Agreement. From December 31, 2016
to the Execution Date, the Company has not received any notification that any
party to a Material Contract or Material Network Agreement intends to
cancel, terminate, materially modify, refuse to perform or refuse to renew

(d)  The Company is not in violation or breach of the terms of any
Government Contract. All representations, certifications and disclosures made
by the Company with respect to any Government Contract were accurate and
complete in all material respects as of their effective date. No reasonable
basis exists to give rise to a claim for fraud in connection with any
Government Contract including under the United States civil or criminal False
Claims Act of 1863 (the "False Claims Act"). The Company has complied in all
material respects with the terms and conditions of each Government Contract
and related applicable Laws including all provisions and laws regarding small
business subcontracting and utilization, subcontracting plans,
affirmative action, protection and security of personal data or data of a
Governmental Authority, kickbacks, illegal gratuities, pricing and other
provisions. The Company has not received a cure notice, show cause notice,
civil investigative demand or had a Government Contract terminated for
default or convenience, have not been threatened with termination for default,
or notified of a breach of contract. None of the Company, its respective
officers or employees or, to the knowledge of the Seller, their respective
agents or Representatives, is or has been suspended or debarred, or to the
knowledge of the Seller, proposed for suspension or debarment, from doing
business with any Governmental Authority, and to the knowledge of the Seller,
there are no circumstances that would reasonably be expected to become a
basis for any of the foregoing. The Company does not have access to any
classified information in connection with any Government Contract and is not
required to have any personnel or facility security clearance.

  



  

(e)  Since December 31, 2016 to the Execution Date, neither the
Company nor the Seller has received any written or oral indication of an
intention to terminate (including a termination for convenience or for cause)
or, in the case of a Material Contract related to an ongoing relationship in
the ordinary course of business with the other party thereto, fail to renew or
extend on substantially similar terms, any Material Contract (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any purchase, sale or service order under any
Material Contract) from any of the parties to any Material Contract. Since
December 31, 2016 to the Execution Date, with respect to any Material
Contract that, by its terms, would automatically renew or extend absent notice
or other action by a party thereto, no such party has given any such notice
or taken any such action. There is no Action pending against or threatened
against the Company or Seller, any present or former officer, director or
employee of any of the Companies or Seller, or any Person for whom any the
Company may be liable with respect to a Material Contract that is by or before
(or that would be by or before) any Governmental Authority or arbitrator.

  



  

Section 3.17.   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



    

 21

 



    

(a)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17(a) hereto, neither the
Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (with respect to current or former
Company employees or other service providers) maintains, is a party to, or has
any obligation to make contributions to or has any direct or indirect
liability with respect to any employee benefit plan, as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), whether or not such employee benefit plan is subject to ERISA, or
any retirement, compensation or employment (other than standard offer letters
that do not provide for contractual severance or other material contractual
entitlements), consulting, retention, change in control, welfare, profit-
sharing, stock option, stock bonus, deferred compensation, incentive
compensation, equity compensation, severance, fringe benefit or other
employee benefit plan, program or agreement (collectively "Benefit Plans").
All such Benefit Plans have been maintained and operated in material
compliance with all federal, state and local laws applicable to such plans and
the terms and conditions of the respective plan documents, and, to the
Seller's knowledge, no fact or circumstance exists that would cause any
Benefit Plan to not be in material compliance with its terms and all federal,
state and local laws applicable to such Benefit Plan.

  



  

(b)  The Seller, prior to the execution hereof, has made available
to the Buyer, to the extent applicable, copies of: (i) all documents which
comprise the most current version of each Benefit Plan and any amendments
thereto; (ii) the most recent summary plan description with respect to each
Benefit Plan; (iii) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) and
accompanying schedules for each Benefit Plan; and (iv) the most recent IRS

(c)  The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified pursuant to
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or, in the case of such a Benefit Plan that is based upon a pre-approved plan
document, the IRS has issued a favorable advisory or opinion letter with
respect to the form of the underlying plan and no event has occurred that
would disqualify the plan or, to the Seller's knowledge, is likely to result
in the revocation of such letter.

  



  

(d)  No Benefit Plan and no employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) currently maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by, or in the past six (6) years maintained or contributed
to or required to be contributed to by, the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
(an "ERISA Affiliate Plan") is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. No Benefit Plan and no ERISA Affiliate Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section
4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), nor has the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to,
any Multiemployer Plan or any Multiple Employer Plan within the preceding six
years. The Company is not reasonably expected to have any direct or indirect
liability under Title IV or ERISA, including with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

  



    

 22

 



    

(e)  No non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is
described in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred
with respect to any of the Benefit Plans that would subject the Company, any
officer of the Company or any of such plans or any trust to any material Tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code
or ERISA.

  



  

(f)  Except for continuation coverage as required by Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or similar state
insurance laws, no Benefit Plan provides life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof.

  



  

(g)  Each Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and maintained in material operational and documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder.

  



  

(h)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not, either
alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee, officer, director, or consultant of the Company to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar termination payment; (ii)
accelerate the timing of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of or
otherwise enhance any benefit due under any Benefit Plan; (iii) limit or
restrict the right to merge, amend, or terminate any Benefit Plan; or (iv)
result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

  



  

(i)  There are no pending or, to the Seller's knowledge,
threatened audits or investigations by any governmental agency involving any
Benefit Plan. There are no actions, suits or claims pending (other than
routine claims for benefits), or, to the Seller's knowledge, threatened
against, or with respect to, any Benefit Plan.

  



  

(j)  All material contributions required to be made to the Benefit
Plans pursuant to their terms have been timely made, and all premiums due or
payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Benefit Plan, in each
case for any period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in
full.

  



  

(k)  The Company has no obligation to gross-up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any current or former employees, directors, consultants
or other service providers of the Company for any tax incurred by such
employee, director, consultant or service provider, including under Section
409A or 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(l)  There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Benefit Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such
plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most
recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

  



    

 23

 



    

Section 3.18.   _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(a)  Schedule 3.18(a) hereto sets forth a list of (i) all patents,
trademarks, trade names and copyrights registered in the name of the Company
and all applications therefor, and (ii) all material written agreements

licensed on nondiscriminatory terms) or which the Company has licensed or
authorized for use by others.

  



  

(b)  Except to the extent set forth on Schedule 3.18(b) hereto,
the Company owns or has a valid, enforceable and sufficient right to use all
Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use in the conduct of the
business of the Company as currently conducted, except where the failure to
own or have such rights would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Company, taken as a whole. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
alter, encumber, impair or extinguish any Owned Intellectual Property Rights
or Licensed Intellectual Property Rights. There exist no restrictions on the
transfer of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights.

  



  

(c)  The Company has not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated, or is not infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, any
Intellectual Property Right of any Person. There is no Action pending or
threatened against the Company or any present or former officer, director or
employee of the Company (i) based upon, or challenging or seeking to deny or
restrict, the rights of the Company in any of the Owned Intellectual Property
Rights or the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights other than administrative
proceedings to obtain Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) alleging that the use
of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights or the Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights or any services provided or processes used by the Company
conflict with, misappropriate, infringe or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property Right of any third party or (iii) alleging that the Company has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any Person.

  



  

(d)  None of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights has been
adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part, and, to the knowledge of
the Seller, all Owned Intellectual Property Rights and Licensed Intellectual
Property Rights are valid and enforceable. The Company is the sole and
exclusive owner of all Owned Intellectual Property Rights and holds all right,
title and interest in and to all Owned Intellectual Property Rights, free and
clear of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens), subject to any non-
exclusive licenses granted.

  



  

(e)  The Company has taken all reasonable actions to maintain and
protect the Owned Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the
business or operations of the Company as currently conducted.

  



  

(f)  Within the last three years, no Person has infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated any Owned Intellectual Property Right
or the Company's rights in any Licensed Intellectual Property Right. The
Company has taken reasonable steps in

  



    

 24

 



    

accordance with normal industry practice to maintain the confidentiality of
all Intellectual Property Rights that are of a confidential nature used in
and material to the business or operation of the Company as currently
conducted, and no such Intellectual Property Rights have been disclosed other
than to employees, representatives and agents of the Company, all of whom are
bound by written confidentiality agreements substantially in the form
previously made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof. Within the last
three years, to the knowledge of the Seller, the Company has not suffered any
material breaches of any such confidential Intellectual Property Rights that
have resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of or loss of any such
confidential Intellectual Property Rights.

  



  

(g)  The Company owns or has valid rights to access and use all
computer systems (including all computer programs, applications, software,
databases, firmware, hardware and related documentation, collectively, "IT
Systems") used to process, store, maintain and operate data, information and
functions used in connection with the business of the Company as currently
conducted, except where the failure to own or have such valid access and use
rights has not had and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Company, taken as a whole. (i) The
Company has taken commercially reasonable steps, consistent with current
industry standards, to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of
the IT Systems against any unauthorized use, access, interruptions,
modifications or corruption, including the implementation of commercially
reasonable (x) data backup, (y) disaster avoidance and recovery procedures
and (z) business continuity procedures and (ii) to the knowledge of Seller,
the IT Systems are free of all viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or similar

in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties under this
Section 5.4(a) shall terminate with respect to information provided by or on

possessed by Seller, its Affiliates and its and their representatives and
shall not use the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any such Person may disclose Confidential Information as and to the extent
required by applicable Law, so long as the disclosing party notifies Buyer in

all other information regarding the Company's business as the Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including as it relates to facilitating their
determination of whether any property or asset of the Company is REIT
Qualifying Property, together with the opportunity, at the sole cost and
expense of the Buyer, to make copies of any such documents and (ii) cooperate,
and cause the Company (including the Company's directors, officers,
employees, advisors, accountants and counsel) to cooperate, with the Buyer
and its representatives (including accountants and counsel), in connection
with the foregoing. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide the
Buyer and its authorized representatives (including directors, officers,
employees, advisors, accountants and counsel) an opportunity to make such
investigations as they shall reasonably desire to make of the Company (
_provided_  that such investigations shall be conducted so as to reasonably
minimize any disruption of the operations of the Company and in no event
shall the Buyer conduct, without the prior written consent of the Seller which
the Seller may withhold for any reason, any invasive or intrusive
environmental investigation, including any sampling of soil, sediment or
groundwater), and the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Buyer and its representatives all such
information with respect to the affairs and business of the Company as the
Buyer may reasonably request. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and
agree that they have common and mutual legal interests in the Company's
information and have agreed to the provisions in this Agreement, including
this Section 5.5(a), in furtherance of these common and mutual legal
interests. No investigation by the Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, accountants and counsel
or other information received by the Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, accountants and counsel
shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Seller hereunder.

action prohibited by Section 5.6 will not be a breach of this Section 5.5(b)
if the Buyer refuses to provide its consent thereto.

the generality of Section 5.5(b), from the date hereof until the Closing or

efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Financing
Commitments"). In furtherance of and without limitation to the foregoing,
Parent and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent the
Buyer is expressly permitted to earlier terminate such Financing Commitments
pursuant to the other terms and provisions of this Section 5.13), and (ii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter

Buyer, including with respect to conditionality (which terms shall not (x)

(y) expand the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing or (z) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available under the Financing
Commitments below the amount needed to fund the cash portion of the Purchase
Price, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (y) and (z) only, to the
extent that such expansion of such

  



    

 48

 



    

conditions, or such reduction of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
so available, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
availability of the Debt Financing; and (iii) satisfy, perform and observe on
a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions and covenants applicable
to Buyer and its Affiliates in the Debt Commitment Letter and in any
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent and the Buyer

Letter and (ii) shall exercise their respective rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
and the consummation thereof at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that

enforcement actions against any Financing Party.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, (i) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing (other than to the extent
that any such terminated Debt Commitment Letter are concurrently replaced in
accordance with the other terms and provisions of this Section 5.13), (ii)
agree to, permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification to,
or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would (A) reduce (or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing below the amount needed to fund the cash portion of the Purchase
Price (unless, concurrently with such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver, Buyer obtains replacement financing for the full amount of any such
reduction (or expected reduction) in accordance with the other terms and
provisions of this Section 5.13), (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing or otherwise adversely
change, expand or amend or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
which would be reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the availability of the
Debt Financing or (C) reasonably be expected to delay, impair or prevent the
funding of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that
Parent and the Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing for the sole purpose of adding or
replacing lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing as of the date of this Agreement,
but only if such action would not result in the occurrence of any of the
events or circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (C)) or
(iii) agree to, permit or consent to any waiver of any remedy available to
Parent and the Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter or under any definitive
agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent and the Buyer shall
promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any such
termination, amendment, modification, supplement or waiver to the extent
entered into prior to the Closing.

  



  

(d)  Parent and the Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably
informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and
shall, upon reasonable request, provide to the Seller copies of the definitive
agreements relating to the Debt Financing;  _provided_

  



    

 49

 



    

that, in the case of customary fee letters, any fee amounts, pricing caps and
other economic terms of the market flex provisions set forth therein may be
redacted. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and the
Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice (i) of any termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing or
any portion of the Debt Financing, (ii) of any breach or default by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing of which Parent or the Buyer becomes aware, and (iii) of the
receipt by Parent, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates of any written notice
or other written communication from any Lender or any other Person with
respect to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement relating to the
Debt Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Seller delivers to Parent or the Buyer a written request, Parent and the
Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this Section 5.13(d).

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and
the Buyer may at any time (in their sole discretion) terminate the Financing
Commitments if (i) concurrently with such termination, (A) Parent and the
Buyer shall have arranged and obtained alternative financing in replacement
thereof from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all
fees and expenses related thereto, with terms and conditions (including market
flex provisions) related to conditionality and certainty of financing not
less favorable in all material respects, in the aggregate, to Parent and the
Buyer than the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments,
and (B) Parent and the Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall have agreed
to pay all fees and expenses related to such alternative financing, and (ii)
such alternative financing would not reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
delay the Closing of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or (B)
otherwise expand the Seller's or the Company's obligations under this
Agreement, as compared to such obligations as of the date hereof. Parent and
the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller true and complete copies of any and all
executed agreements pursuant to which any such source shall have committed to
provide any portion of the Debt Financing; _provided _ that, in the case of
customary fee letters, any fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms
of the "market flex" provisions set forth therein may be redacted.

  



  

(f)  For purposes of this Agreement, references to (i) the "Debt
Financing" shall include (A) the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as the same is amended, modified or supplemented as
permitted by this Section 5.13 and (B) any alternative financing that has
been arranged and obtained by Buyer in replacement of all or any portion of
the Debt Financing in accordance with this Section 5.13, and (ii) the "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include (A) any amendments, modifications or
supplements thereto permitted by this Section 5.13 and (B) any agreement

the Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing, subject to
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7.

Seller shall deliver unaudited combined financial statements for any interim
quarterly period or periods ended after December 31, 2016 and on or prior to
the Closing Date, together with interim financial statements for the same
period in the prior year, which interim financial statements shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP on the same basis as the
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and shall have been
reviewed by the Company's independent auditors using professional standards
and procedures for conducting such reviews as required by Rule 10-01 of
Regulation S-X for interim

  



    

 55

 



    

financial statements filed in a periodic report with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The audited financial statements and the
interim financial statements referenced in the preceding sentence are referred
to herein as the "Required Financial Statements".

  



  

Section 5.23.   _Shelf Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a)  Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
its registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Shelf Registration Statement")
continuously effective under the Securities Act in order to permit the
Prospectus forming a part thereof to be usable by the Seller for the sale of
Registrable Securities until the date as of which there are no
Registrable Securities outstanding. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall file on the Closing Date a Prospectus supplement naming the Seller
(subject to receipt of information reasonably requested by Parent necessary to
complete such Prospectus supplement). Except as would not materially restrict
or impair Seller's rights to use the Shelf Registration Statement, Parent
hereby represents and warrants that (i) the Shelf Registration Statement
referred to in this Section 5.23 is an "automatic shelf registration
statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed
with the SEC not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof; and no
notice of objection of the SEC to the use of such registration statement or
any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the
Securities Act has been received by Parent; (ii) at the time of
initial filing of the Shelf Registration Statement and at the time of the
most recent amendment thereto for purposes of compliance with Section
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, and at the time Parent was a "well known
seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405, including not having been an
"ineligible issuer" as defined in Rule 405; (iii) as of the date hereof, no
order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement has
been issued by the SEC and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act against Parent or related to the offering has
been initiated or threatened by the SEC; (iv) as of the applicable effective
date of the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, the Shelf
Registration Statement complied and will comply with the Securities Act, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and did not and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading; and (v) as of the date of the Prospectus
and any amendment or supplement thereto, the Prospectus will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b)  If the continued use of the Shelf Registration Statement at
any time would require Parent to make an Adverse Disclosure, Parent may, upon
giving at least three days' prior written notice of such action to the Seller,
suspend use of the Shelf Registration Statement (an "Unusual Shelf
Suspension"); provided that Parent shall not be permitted to exercise an
Unusual Shelf Suspension (i) more than two times during any 12-month period or
(ii) for a period exceeding 30 days on any one occasion. In addition, Parent
may, upon giving at least three days' prior written notice to the Seller,
suspend the use of the Shelf Registration Statement during the regular
quarterly period during which

  



    

 56

 



    

directors and officers of Parent are not permitted to trade under the insider
trading policy of Parent then in effect until the expiration of such
quarterly period (a "Regular Shelf Suspension," together with an Unusual Shelf
Suspension, a "Shelf Suspension"); provided that the right of Parent to cause
a Regular Shelf Suspension shall not be applicable to holders of Registrable
Securities for more than a total of 120 days during any 12-month period. In
the case of a Shelf Suspension, the Seller shall suspend use of the
applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to
sell or purchase, any Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice
referred to above. Parent shall immediately notify the Seller upon
the termination of any Shelf Suspension. Parent shall, if necessary,
supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, if
required by the registration form used by Parent for the Shelf Registration
Statement or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by
the Securities Act.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, none of Parent,
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall have any
obligation to prepare any Prospectus supplement (other than a Prospectus
supplement to an existing shelf registration statement to name the Seller as
selling shareholder), participate in any due diligence, execute any agreements
or certificates or deliver legal opinions or obtain comfort letters.

  



  

(d)  Parent shall indemnify the Seller and, the Seller's officers,
managers, partners and members, and each person or entity, if any, that
controls the Seller within the meaning of the Securities Act or Exchange Act,
as applicable, (each, an "Indemnitee"), against any and all Damages arising
out of or based upon (a) any violation by Parent (or any of its agents or
Affiliates) of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law
or of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, Exchange
Act or any state securities law applicable to Parent and relating to action or
inaction required of Parent under this Section 5.23 or in connection with the
Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or (b) any third party claim based
upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the
Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or
required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act unless
required to be filed as a result of its inclusion in a free writing
prospectus prepared by the Seller without Parent's prior written approval
(for purposes of this section, the "Securities Act Information"), or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be liable to any such
Indemnitee or any person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or
sale of Registrable Securities or any other person, if any, who controls such
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, in any such case to the
extent that any such Damages arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
the Securities Act Information in reliance upon and in conformity with
information regarding such Indemnitee or its plan of distribution or
ownership interests that was furnished in writing to Parent for use
in connection with the Securities Act Information contained therein by such
Indemnitee or (ii) the Seller's failure to send or give a copy of the final,
amended or supplemented prospectus furnished to the Seller by Parent at or
prior to the time such action is required by the Securities Act to the person
claiming an untrue statement or alleged untrue

  



    

 57

 



    

statement or omission or alleged omission if such statement or omission was
corrected in a final amended or supplemented Prospectus.

  



  

Section 5.24.   _Transfers_. Except as contemplated by this Agreement,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, the Seller agrees not to take any
action to, directly or indirectly, (a) offer to sell, sell, assign, transfer
(including by operation of law), pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
Company Securities, (b) deposit any Company Securities into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any Company
Securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto or
(c) enter into any Contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with
respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer (including by
operation of law) or other disposition of or transfer of any Company
Securities or the voting of any Company Securities.

Article 9 
 Certain Covenants

  



  

Section 9.1.   _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the
Company to reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the
Closing Date were managers or officers of the Company (collectively, the "DandO
Indemnitees") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company at any time
prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer agrees that all rights of the DandO
Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective Organizational Documents of the Company as now in effect shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
(i) for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing Date,
maintain provisions in the Company's Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of any of its DandO Indemnitees (unless required
by Law) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than such provisions in
the Company's Organizational Documents as of the Closing and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any material respect that would
adversely affect the rights, taken as a whole, of the DandO Indemnitees
thereunder, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), except as required by
applicable Law. In addition, Buyer shall cause the Company to pay any
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of any DandO Indemnitee under
this Section 9.1 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ , that the DandO Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law or in the event that it is determined by a court that such DandO
Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct for
indemnification under this Section 9.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 9.1(a) or in any Organizational Document of the
Company, from and after the Closing, the Company shall not be required to
reimburse, indemnify, defend, or hold harmless, or advance any expenses to,
any DandO Indemnitee for an act or omission that (i) was not taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith, (ii) was not taken or omitted to be taken in a manner
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the interests of the
Company, (iii) with respect to any such action or omission resulting in a
criminal investigation or proceeding, the Person taking such action had
reason to believe such action or omission was unlawful; or (iii) constitutes
fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Buyer shall provide
(including by extending coverage under the Buyer's own policies) six (6)
year 'tail' directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
insurance policies to the DandO Indemnitees covering such claims with respect
to matters occurring at or prior to the Closing that are no less favorable
than the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary insurance policies in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Each DandO Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate, and cause
their respective Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense of any
DandO Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause

  



    

 61

 



    

to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this Section 9.1(i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the DandO Indemnitees, their heirs
and their personal representatives, (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have in the Organizational Documents of the Company
and any of the other documents on Schedule 9.1 and (iii) shall be binding on
all successors and permitted assigns of the Buyer and the Company. In the
event that the Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (x) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (y) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this Section 9.1.

  



  

Section 9.2.   _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a)  During the twelve (12)-month period following the Closing,
the Buyer shall provide each of the employees who continue in employment with
the Company following the Closing, as the Buyer may determine from time to
time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), with employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to those provided by the Company to
employees of the Company having similar responsibilities and positions as such
employees prior to the date hereof. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall cause the Company to take all actions necessary to terminate, or cause
to be terminated, effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing
Date, the Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 9.2(a) hereto and any other
Benefit Plan that the Buyer requests the Company to terminate not less than
10 days prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Closing Date, for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting in benefits provided by the Buyer to any
Continuing Employee, but not benefit accrual, the Buyer shall provide the
Continuing Employees with credit for service to the Company under an
analogous Benefit Plan to the extent service with the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof is taken into account under the
welfare benefit plans or programs of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries (each, a
"Buyer Plan"), except to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. The Buyer shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that any Buyer Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on
the basis of a pre-existing condition, actively-at-work requirement or
required physical examination to the extent that such exclusions or conditions
were not applicable to the Continuing Employee and/or the employee's
dependents under a group health plan of the Company, and (ii) cause the Buyer
Plans to credit Continuing Employees for any deductibles, co-payments and out-
of-pocket expenses paid in the year of initial participation in each such
Buyer Plan to the extent as if such amounts had been paid under such Buyer
Plans.

  



    

 62

 



    

(c)  This Section 9.2 shall inure exclusively to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall (i) be deemed to
be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that
term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise limit the right
of Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates, to amend, modify or
terminate any such employee benefit plan, (ii) give any third party
(including any Continuing Employee and any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 9.2 or (iii) obligate
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (x) maintain any particular benefit plan or
(y) retain the employment of any particular employee of the Company. Subject
to the other provisions set forth in this Section 9.2, after the Closing and
subject to applicable Law and the terms of any Benefit Plan, the Buyer may
amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan in existence prior to the
Closing.

  



  

Section 9.3.   _No Amendment of Prior Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as required by applicable Law,
amend any Tax Return filed by or on behalf of the Company for any period
prior to Closing.

  



  

Section 9.4.   _R andW Insurance Policy_. The RandW Insurance Policy
obtained by the Buyer shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the
Seller by the insurer (except in instances of fraud). From and after the
issuance of the RandW Insurance Policy, Buyer shall not amend, modify or
otherwise waive such subrogation provision of the RandW Insurance Policy in a
manner adverse to the Seller.

  



  

Article 10 
 Indemnification

  



  

Section 10.1.   _Indemnity by the Seller_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 10, the Seller, from and after the Closing, shall save,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company) and the respective representatives,
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (together, the
"Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the foregoing with respect to, any and all claims, demands,
suits, proceedings, judgments, charges, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
Actions, diminution in value, lost profits, liabilities, losses, damages,
Taxes, fees, costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, accountants and expert witnesses' fees), and
reasonable costs and expenses of investigation and amounts paid
in settlement, court costs and other reasonable expenses of litigation,
including in respect of enforcement of their indemnity rights hereunder, but
excluding any punitive damages (except to the extent payable to third parties)
(collectively, "Damages"), arising out of, resulting from or related to:

  



  

(a)  any inaccuracy or breach, as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing Date, by the Seller of any representation or warranty made
by the Seller in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect or similar qualification, other than in Section 3.11(a));

  



    

 63

 



    

(b)  any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement
made by (i) the Seller or (ii) the Company (in the case of (ii), to be
performed at or prior to the Closing) in this Agreement;

  



  

(c)  any Transaction Expenses that were not reflected in the
Closing Date Consideration; and

  



  

(d)  any Indebtedness of the Company as of the close of business
on the Closing Date that was not reflected in the Closing Date Consideration.

  



  

The Buyer Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to this Section 10.1 for any liability or Indebtedness to the extent such
Buyer Indemnified Party was compensated for such liability or Indebtedness in
the calculations of Closing Date Net Indebtedness or Closing Date Net Working
Capital used to determine the Closing Date Consideration.

  



  

Section 10.2.   _Indemnity by the Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 10, the Buyer, from and after the Closing, shall save,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from and against, and shall
compensate and reimburse the Seller with respect to, any and all Damages
arising out of, resulting from or related to:

  



  

(a)  any inaccuracy or breach, as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing Date, by the Buyer of any representation or warranty made
by the Buyer in this Agreement; or

  



  

(b)  any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement
made by the Buyer in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.3.   _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a)  In the event that any party (the "Indemnitee") to this
Agreement desires to make a claim against the other party under Sections 10.1
or 10.2 above, as applicable (the "Indemnitor"), in connection with any
action, suit, proceeding or demand at any time instituted against or made upon
a party by any third party for which such party may seek indemnification
hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim and of the Indemnitee's claim of
indemnification with respect thereto; _provided _ that the failure to
promptly notify the Indemnitor shall not limit the indemnification obligations
of the Indemnitor under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(b)  The Indemnitor, at its option, upon written acknowledgement
to the Indemnitee of the Indemnitor's irrevocable and unconditional
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder against Damages that may
result from the Third Party Claim, subject in all respects to the limitations
set forth in Section 10.4, may assume the defense thereof at the expense of
the Indemnitor (which expenses shall not be drawn from the Holdback Funds)
unless the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) do not include both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and
the latter shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the
Indemnitor) that there

  



    

 64

 



    

are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to them that are
different from or additional to those available to Indemnitor and so long as
(and only for so long as): (i) the Third Party Claim involves solely monetary
Damages, (ii) the defense of the Third Party Claim by the Indemnitor, will
not, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee, have any continuing adverse
effect on the Indemnitee's business, assets, operations or financial
conditions, (iii) the Indemnitor diligently defends in good faith such Third
Party Claim and keeps the Indemnitee reasonably informed of the progress of
such Third Party Claim, (iv) the Indemnitor demonstrates to the Indemnitee's
reasonable satisfaction that, as of such time, the Indemnitor has
sufficient resources in order to pay for the defense of such Third Party
Claim and (taking into account the amount then remaining of the Holdback
Amount if the Seller is the Indemnitor) indemnify for the full amount of any
potential Damages in connection with such Third Party Claim (subject in all
respects to the limitations set forth in Section 10.4), (v) the Third Party
Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with any criminal
or regulatory Action and (vi) only if the Seller is the Indemnitor, the
Damages that may result from the Third Party Claim along with any and all
other pending claims for which the Seller is Indemnitor are not reasonably
expected to exceed the amount then remaining of the Holdback Amount.

  



  

(c)  The Indemnitor shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of
a Third Party Claim to notify the Indemnitee in accordance with the foregoing
if the Indemnitor seeks to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnitor delivers the required notice and elects to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled, at its own
expense (which expenses shall not be drawn from the Holdback Funds), to
conduct and control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim through counsel of its own choosing, _provided_ , that such counsel is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the
Indemnitee may participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel at its own expense;  _provided_ that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel (i)
incurred by the Indemnitee prior to the date the Indemnitor assumes control
of the defense of the Third Party Claim or during any period in which the
Indemnitor ceases to be eligible to maintain control of the defense of the
Third Party Claim, in either case as provided in this Section 10.3, (ii) if
representation of both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee by the same counsel
would create a conflict of interest or (iii) if counsel chosen by the
Indemnitor requests a conflict waiver or other waiver from the
Indemnitee with respect to such matter.

  



  

(d)  If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense of, or
fails to notify the Indemnitee within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the
Indemnitee's notice of a Third Party Claim, and until such time as the
Indemnitor responds to a Third Party Claim as required pursuant to this
Section 10.3, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim at the Indemnitor's expense (which expenses, if the Seller
is the Indemnitor, may at the Buyer's election be drawn from the Holdback
Funds) to the extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement for such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnitee may not
settle any Third Party Claim for which the Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement without the Indemnitor's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  



    

 65

 



    

(e)  If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of such Third
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.3, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent before entering into any
settlement, compromise, discharge or acknowledgement of the validity of such
Third Party Claim or ceasing to defend such Third Party Claim if (i) any
payment obligations with respect to such settlement, compromise, discharge or
acknowledgement are not satisfied in full by the Indemnitor, (ii) pursuant to
or as a result of such settlement, compromise, discharge or acknowledgement ,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee
or its Affiliates, (iii) such settlement, compromise, discharge or
acknowledgement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim, without prejudice, or (iv) if such settlement, compromise,
discharge or acknowledgement includes any statement as to or an admission of
fact, or failure to act, by or on behalf of the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates.

  



  

(f)  Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party
Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
testimony (subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement), and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 10.4.   _Limitations of Liability_. Without limiting Parent's or
Buyer's ability to recover under the RandW Insurance Policy:

  



  

(a)  The Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in respect of Section 10.1(a) except to the extent that
the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a), exceeds
$3,500,000 (the "Minimum Amount") (it being understood and agreed that the
Minimum Amount is intended as a true deductible, and the Seller shall not be
liable for any Damages less than the Minimum Amount for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)). The Seller and the Buyer agree that the threshold set forth
in this paragraph for the Minimum Amount is an amount negotiated by the
parties for purposes of this Section 10.4 and is not determinative of what
was, is or should be "material" or had, has or is likely to have a "Material
Adverse Effect," as such terms or any other similar terms may be used in
other Sections of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Minimum
Amount limitation shall only apply to Section 10.1(a) and shall not apply to
Damages arising out of, resulting from or related to (i) breaches or
inaccuracies of Sections 3.1 (Authority; Binding Effect), 3.2 (Title to
Membership Interests), 3.3(a) (Organization), 3.4 (Subsidiaries), 3.5
(Capitalization), 3.7(i) (Consents with respect to Organizational Documents),
3.9 (Taxes), 3.24(a) (Brokers) and 3.27 (Investment Purpose) (the
"Fundamental Representations"), (ii) breaches of Section 3.19(b), (c) and (d)
(Indebtedness and Restricted Cash) or (iii) fraud.

  



  

(b)  Except with respect to claims relating to a breach of the
Fundamental Representations, breaches of the covenants set forth in Sections
5.6(c), 5.6(h) (solely with respect to non-cash distributions), 5.6(t), 5.6(x)
and 5.12 or in the event of fraud, for

  



    

 66

 



    

which the aggregate Damages payable by the Seller will be limited to the
amount of the Closing Date Consideration (less any amount previously paid or
to be paid by the Seller pursuant to this Section 10) and which may be drawn
from the Holdback Funds or recovered directly from the Seller at Buyer's
election, (i) the aggregate Damages payable by the Seller pursuant to Section
10.1 shall be drawn from the Holdback Funds, and (ii) the amount of such
Damages for which Seller is liable under Section 10.1 shall at no time exceed
an amount equal to the Holdback Funds at such time (except that amounts in
excess of the Holdback Funds may be recovered under the RandW Insurance
Policy).

  



  

(c)  The aggregate Damages payable by Parent and the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of the Closing Date
Consideration (less any amount previously payable by Parent and the Buyer).

  



  

Section 10.5.   _Expiration of Representations and Warranties and
Covenants; Scope of Liability; Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the representations and warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered in connection
with this Agreement and the right of an Indemnitee to assert any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 shall survive the Closing until
5:00 p.m. on the date that is the Holdback Termination Date (except for (i)
the Fundamental Representations, which shall survive for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, (ii) as set forth in Section 5.12, and (iii)
any covenants to be performed following the Closing (other than in Section
5.12), which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations following the date all performance thereunder was due to be
performed);  _provided_ that the time periods set forth in this Section
10.5(a) shall not affect the time periods during which any claim may be made
under the RandW Insurance Policy.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 10.5(a), a party's rights to
indemnification shall not terminate with respect to any claim, whether or not
fixed as to liability or liquidated in amount, with respect to which the
indemnified party has in good faith delivered written notice to the
indemnifying party, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period,
setting forth the basis for indemnification and the facts upon which the
claim for indemnification is based and, if known to the Indemnitee, a
reasonable estimate of the Damages relating thereto, without requiring such
party to commence litigation or any other proceeding.

  



  

(c)  Each party acknowledges and agrees that, except with respect
to claims for fraud, claims under the other Transaction Agreements or
pursuant to Section 12.17, from and after Closing (i) its sole and exclusive
monetary remedy against the other party for any matter arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is set forth in this Article
10 and Sections 1.2 and 5.12, (ii) except to the extent a party has asserted
a claim for indemnification prior to the relevant termination date in
accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and 10.5(b), such party shall have no remedy
against the other party for any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of a
representation or warranty or covenant, as applicable, made by such party in
this Agreement (other than Section 5.12) and (iii) it hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,

  



    

 67

 



    

claims and causes of action it may have against the other party relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement arising under or based upon any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise, other than those claims made in accordance with the provisions and
applicable limitations of this Article 10 and Sections 1.2 and 5.12 or under
the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 10.5(c)
shall preclude, diminish or limit in any way any claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy. The parties acknowledge that this Section 10.5 has been
negotiated fully by the Buyer and the Seller and that neither party would have
entered into this Agreement but for the inclusion of this Section 10.5.

  



  

Section 10.6.   _Direct Claims_. In any case in which the Indemnitee
seeks indemnification under this Article 10 which is not subject to Section
10.3 because no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnitee shall notify the
Indemnitor in writing of any Damages that such Indemnitee claims are subject
to indemnification under the terms hereof. The failure of the Indemnitee to
exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such
claim unless and only to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced thereby. After the delivery of a claim notice pursuant to this
Section 10.6 by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor, the amount of
indemnification to which the Indemnitee shall be entitled under shall be
determined (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor, (ii) by a final and nonappealable judgment or decree of any court
of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnitee
and the Indemnitor shall agree in writing.

  



  

Section 10.7.   _Seller 's Release_. (a) Effective as of the Closing, the
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Company) and
its and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and legal representatives
(such Person, its Affiliates (other than the Company) and its and their
successors, assigns, heirs and legal representatives, collectively, the
"Releasing Parties"), (i) provides any consent necessary to effectuate
Section 5.10 and (ii) irrevocably waives, relinquishes, releases and forever
discharges the Company, Parent, the Buyer, the Financing Parties, their
respective Affiliates and their and their respective Affiliates' past,
current and future directors, officers, employees, agents, members, managers,
partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Released Parties", and such release, remise and discharge, the "Seller
Release") from any and all claims (whether at law, in equity or otherwise),
obligations and liabilities (of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, known or unknown or otherwise) that any Releasing Party ever had,
now has, or may ever have against any Released Party in any capacity,
including in their capacity as a director, officer or employee, as
applicable, whether directly or derivatively through the Company, and whether
asserted contemporaneously with, prior to or after the Closing, on account of
or arising out of (i) any acts, omissions, transactions, matters, causes or
events occurring prior to, contemporaneously with or up to and including the
Closing relating to the Company, and (ii) the approval or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any Transaction Document or any other
agreement contemplated herein or therein, including any alleged breach of any
duty by any officer, manager or director of the Company or any claims under
the Organizational Documents of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in the foregoing Seller Release shall (x)

  



    

 68

 



    

limit in any manner the ability of Seller or any other Releasing Party to
enforce its rights under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to
which it is a party, including any rights to claims for indemnification
hereunder or (y) affect any right to accrued and vested but unpaid
compensation and employee benefits of any Releasing Party in his or her
capacity as an employee of the Company. The Seller (on behalf of itself and
its Releasing Parties) represents to the Released Parties that it has not
assigned or transferred or purported to assign or transfer to any Person all
of any part of, or any interest in, any claim, contention, demand, cause of
action (at law or in equity) or liability of any nature, character or
description whatsoever, which is or which purports to be released or
discharged hereby. The Seller (on behalf of itself and its Releasing Parties)
(i) represents that it understands and acknowledges that it may hereafter
discover facts and legal theories concerning the subject matter hereof in
addition to or different from those of which it now believes to be true and
hereby agrees that the Seller Release hereby shall remain effective in all
respects notwithstanding those additional or different facts and legal
theories or the discovery of those additional or different facts or legal
theories and (ii) assumes the risk of any mistake of fact or law with regard
to any potential claim or with regard to any of the facts that are now
unknown to it relating thereto.

  



  

(b)  Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and without limiting the foregoing, (a) no Financing Party
will have any liability to the Seller or any other Releasing Party relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; (b) none of the Seller or
any other Releasing Party will have any rights or claims against any
Financing Party, and all such rights and claims are waived and (c) none of
the Seller or the Releasing Parties shall bring any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing or arbitration of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise against any Financing Party.

terminated prior to Closing as follows:

  



  

(a)  at the election of the Buyer or the Seller after August 7,
2017, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on such
date (the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1(a) shall not be available if
the failure of the party so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the primary cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing have
been satisfied by the Outside Date, except those stated in Sections 6.1, 6.2,
7.5 or 8.4 (other than the Closing Date Conditions; _provided_ that the
Closing Date Conditions would be reasonably expected to be satisfied at
Closing if Closing were to occur on the Outside Date), then either Seller or
Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by providing written
notice to the other party, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
to extend the Outside Date to October 7, 2017; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the Outside Date is extended, Schedule 11.1(a) shall apply

specified in Schedule 11.1(a));

  



  

(b)  by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer;

final nonappealable order of a Governmental Authority of

(d)  by the Buyer, if there has been a material violation or

the Closing, and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Buyer or
cured by the Seller within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by the
Seller of written notice thereof from the Buyer; or

  



  

(e)  by the Seller if there has been a violation or breach by
Parent or the Buyer of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement that has not been primarily caused by a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller or the Company and would
prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Seller at
the Closing, and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Seller
or cured by Parent or the Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days
after receipt by the Buyer of written notice thereof from the Seller (
_provided_ , that the failure to deliver the Purchase Price at the Closing as
required hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Seller).

  



  

Section 11.2.   _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination
by the Buyer or the Seller, or both, pursuant to Section 11.1 hereof, the
terminating party shall forthwith deliver notice thereof to the other party or

the Buyer, Parent or the Seller.

is validly terminated in accordance with Section 11.1, then this Agreement
shall thereupon become void and of no further force and effect and each of the
parties shall be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this
Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination shall
be without liability to the Buyer, the Parent, the Company, the Seller or
their respective Affiliates; _provided_ , that:

  



  

(a)  except as expressly set forth herein, no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or Damages for any willful
and material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which case
the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity;

  



  

(b)  this Section 11.3 and Sections 5.4(a), 5.8 and Article 12
hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.

Section 12.3.   _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This
Agreement, including all of the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the other

understanding of the parties, supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and shall not
be amended except by a written instrument hereafter signed by the Buyer,

Section 12.3, no term or condition of this Agreement with respect to Section
10.7 (Seller's Release), 12.3 (Amendment), 12.4 (Governing Law), 12.5 (Waiver
of Jury Trial), 12.7 (Assignment) or 12.8 (No Third Party Beneficiaries) may

manner that is adverse to the interests of any Financing Party, in each
case without the written consent of such Financing Party. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any
other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such
right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

  



  

Section 12.4.   _Governing Law_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal law of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within the State of Delaware,
without regard to any conflicts of law principles of

  



    

 72

 



    

the State of Delaware that would compel the application of the substantive
laws of another jurisdiction; _provided_ that, without limiting the
generality of Section 10.7, any legal action against any Financing Party shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York, without regard to any conflicts of law principles of the State of New
York that would compel the application of the substantive laws of another
jurisdiction.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties agrees that any legal action or other
legal proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any
provision of this Agreement shall be brought or otherwise commenced
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that

State of Delaware. Each of the parties:

  



  

(i)  expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the personal

(and each appellate court located in the State of Delaware) in connection with
any such legal proceeding, including to enforce any settlement, order or
award;

  



  

(ii)  consents to service of process in any such proceeding
anywhere in the world in a manner consistent with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure or in a manner consistent with the applicable law of the

(iii)  agrees that each state and federal court located in the State
of Delaware shall be deemed to be a convenient forum;

  



  

(iv)  irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert
(by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise), in any such legal proceeding
commenced in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware, any
claim that such Person is not subject personally to the jurisdiction in such
court, that such legal proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court; and

  



  

(v)   agrees to the entry of an order to enforce any resolution,
settlement, order or award made pursuant to this __Section 12.4 by the state
and federal courts located in the State of Delaware and in connection
therewith hereby waives, and agrees not to asset by way of motion, as a
defense, or otherwise, any claim that such resolution, settlement, order or
award is inconsistent with or violative of the laws or public policy of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary (but without
limiting Section 10.7), each of the parties acknowledge and irrevocably
agrees, (i) that any such legal proceeding, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Financing
Party arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive

  



    

 73

 



    

jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof, and each of

ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE DEBT FINANCING AND ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE FINANCING
PARTIES), WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY

that Parent and Buyer may (a) assign any or all of its rights hereunder to
one or more of its Affiliates, (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder or (c) pledge, assign or grant to its
lenders or any Person providing financing to the Buyer or its Affiliates, for

borrowings or otherwise ( _provided_ that in the event of assignment as

Section 12.11.   _Business Records_. The Buyer acknowledges that the business
records of the Company relating to its operations prior to Closing will be
acquired by the Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that the Seller may from time to time require access
to or copies of such records. The Buyer agrees that upon reasonable prior
notice from the Seller, it will, during normal business hours and without
undue interruption of Parent's or its Affiliate's business, provide the
Seller with access to or copies of such records but solely to the extent (i)
reasonably required by Seller in connection with any Tax audit or other
action by a Governmental Authority with respect to Seller's ownership of the
Membership Interests prior to the Closing, (ii) necessary to comply with
applicable Law and (iii) related to the defense of any claim made by a Person
(other than Parent or its Affiliates). The Buyer agrees that it will not

Seller and that the Seller will not have an adequate remedy at law, and the

contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, Seller
hereby waives, and causes the Company to irrevocably waive, any provision
