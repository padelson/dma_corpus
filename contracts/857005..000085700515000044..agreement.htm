(B) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is equal to or greater than
the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then the Estimated Working Capital

earned from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any portion
thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code

amount of the Escrow Fund is actually distributed (or deemed distributed
pursuant to the following sentence) to Seller, interest may be imputed on such
amount as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code. Seller intends that any
amounts released from the Escrow Fund and deemed distributed to Seller and
then paid by Seller to SAR Holders in respect of Stock Appreciation Rights or
to Phantom Unitholders in respect of Company Phantom Units shall be treated as
compensation if and when paid for which the corresponding tax deduction inures
for the benefit of Seller, although Buyer makes no covenant, representation,
or warranty as to such Tax treatment. All parties hereto shall file all Tax
Returns consistently with the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.3(c).

  

(d) _Allocation Certificate_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the

1.5. _Post-Closing Adjustment Procedure_.

  

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer will
prepare and deliver to Seller the Closing Balance Sheet together with a
statement (collectively, the " _Closing Financial Statement_ "), setting forth
the Buyer\'s determination of: (A) the aggregate Acquisition Expenses, to the
extent not paid as of the Closing, (B) the aggregate Indebtedness of the
Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent not paid as of the Closing, (C) the
Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Net Working
Capital_ ") and the Working Capital Adjustment, (D) the aggregate amount of
Change in Control Payments to the extent not paid as the Closing, including
any related employer portion of employment Taxes attributable thereto, (E) the
aggregate amount payable in respect of the Company Phantom Units as of the
Closing Date, including any related employer portion of employment Taxes
attributable thereto, (F) the aggregate amount payable in respect of the Stock
Appreciation Rights as of the Closing Date, including any related employer
portion of employment Taxes attributable thereto, and (G) the aggregate amount
of all Other Payments as of the Closing Date. Buyer will promptly cooperate
with Seller and make available at Seller\'s reasonable request all records,
work papers and relevant personnel used in or relating to the preparation of
the Closing Financial Statement and the calculation of the amounts thereon.
The Closing Financial Statement will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

  

(b) If Seller disagrees with the determination of any amounts shown on the
Closing Financial Statement, Seller may notify Buyer in writing of such
disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the Closing
Financial Statement to Seller, which notice will specify in reasonable detail
all disputed items and the basis therefor (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If Seller
fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within this 30-day period, then each of the
amounts and calculations shown on the Closing Financial Statement will be
final and binding. If Seller provides a Dispute Notice to Buyer within such
30-day period, the Closing Financial Statement and the items included in the
Dispute Notice shall be finally determined in accordance with Section 1.5(c).

  

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve all items
included in any Dispute Notice. If Buyer and Seller resolve all such items,
they shall document their agreement in a written document executed by Buyer
and Seller, which shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes of this
Agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all items included in any
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of such Dispute
Notice to Buyer, then only the remaining unresolved items will be submitted
for final and binding resolution to the Boston office of Deloitte and Touche LLP
(the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting Arbitrator will deliver to
Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty
(60) calendar days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the
resolution of each unresolved item determined in

  

 

6  

  

accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which, as to each amount in
disagreement, will be an amount no less than the lesser of the applicable
amounts claimed by either Buyer or Seller, and no greater than the greater of
the applicable amounts claimed by either Buyer or Seller. The determinations
of the Accounting Arbitrator will be final and binding. The fees and expenses
of the Accounting Arbitrator incurred in connection with its determination of
the disputed items will be paid jointly, one-half by Buyer and one-half by
Seller; provided that upon resolution of the dispute, the prevailing party, if
any, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator, shall be entitled to be
reimbursed in proportion to the amount by which the other party\'s
determinations of the items in dispute differed from the amount determined by
the Accounting Arbitrator. Such amount shall be determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator. Other than such fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator,
Buyer and Seller will each be responsible for their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section 1.5.

  

(d) No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final
determination of each of the amounts set forth on the Closing Financial
Statement pursuant to Section 1.5(b) or (c), as the case may be, the Purchase
Price under Section 1.3 will be re-calculated using such finally determined
amounts in lieu of the estimated amounts used to calculate the Estimated
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(b). Such recalculated Purchase Price
will be the " _Final Purchase Price_ ".

  

1.6. _Purchase Price Adjustment._

  

(a) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.5(d) is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer will submit a claim
certificate to the Escrow Agent, which shall not be subject to dispute, for an
amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price and the
Final Purchase Price and shall be entitled to receive payment from the Escrow
Account of the amount of such difference as soon as practicable following the
submission of such claim certificate.

  

(b) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.5(d) is
the same as the Estimated Purchase Price, there will be no further adjustment
made to the Purchase Price.

  

(c) If the Final Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to Section 1.5(d) is
greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following determination of the Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller an amount in cash equal
to the difference between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase
Price.

  

1.7. _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to Section 1.6
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

  

1.8. _Earn-Out_. The following provisions shall apply with respect to the
Earn-Out Consideration, if any.

  

(a) The amount of the Earn-Out Consideration payable, if any, shall be
calculated in accordance with and pursuant to _Schedule 1.8_. As soon as
practical following the conclusion of each of the 12-month, 18-month and
24-month anniversary of the first day of the calendar quarter immediately
following the Closing Date (each, an " _Earn-Out Calculation Date_ ", and
collectively, the " _Earn-Out Period_ "), and in any event not later than
thirty (30) days after each Earn-Out Calculation Date, Buyer shall prepare a
calculation of the amount of the Earn-Out Consideration (each, an " _Earn-Out
Calculation_ "), if any, payable with respect to the period ending on such
Earn-Out Calculation Date in

  

 

7  

  

accordance with _Schedule 1.8_ , and shall deliver a copy of each such Earn-
Out Calculation with reasonable back-up data and a statement showing the
method of computing the applicable Earn-Out Consideration, if any, to Seller.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Seller be entitled to receive Earn-Out Consideration which in the aggregate
exceeds $18,000,000.

  

(b) If Seller disagrees with an Earn-Out Calculation, Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing in reasonable detail of the disagreement and the basis
therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Earn-Out Calculation
(each, an " _Earn-Out Objection_ "). If the Earn-Out Objection is not received
by Buyer within such period or if Seller notifies Buyer that Seller agrees
with Buyer\'s Earn-Out Calculation (each, an " _Earn-Out Confirmation_ "), the
applicable Earn-Out Calculation shall be deemed final and binding for all
purposes of this Agreement and the amount of any Earn-Out Consideration shall
be paid by Buyer within five (5) Business Days following the earlier of (i)
the expiration of such thirty (30) day period and (ii) the delivery of an
Earn-Out Confirmation. If Buyer does receive an Earn-Out Objection within the
applicable thirty (30)-day period, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to promptly resolve any differences within thirty (30) days after timely
delivery of such Earn-Out Objection. If Buyer and Seller resolve their
disagreement, they shall set forth the agreement in a written document
executed by Buyer and Seller and such written document shall be deemed final
and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to resolve their disagreement within such period, any remaining differences
will be submitted to binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts before a
panel of three (3) arbitrators, who shall each have significant experience in
software technology disputes. The panel shall comprise of one (1) arbitrator
selected by Buyer, one (1) arbitrator selected by Seller, and one (1)
arbitrator selected jointly by the two arbitrators selected by the foregoing.
The arbitration shall be pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association then pertaining and shall be governed by the
United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. Any award(s) shall be
subject to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement. Judgment on the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The fees and expenses
of the arbitration shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller, and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; provided that upon resolution of the dispute,
the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, shall be
entitled to be reimbursed in proportion to the amount by which the other
party\'s determinations of the items in dispute differed from the amount
determined by the arbitrators. Such amount shall be determined by the
arbitrators. Any fees and expenses of the arbitrators to be paid by Seller
shall first be paid out of the Escrow Fund, and Buyer and Seller shall execute
and deliver to the Escrow Agent disbursement instructions for the amount of
such fees and expenses to be paid from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. Any Earn-Out Consideration as finally determined by the arbitrators
shall be paid by Buyer consistent with Section 1.8(c), promptly upon delivery
of the arbitrators\' written report, without interest, following such
delivery.

  

(c) Subject to Section 7.3(e), with respect to each period ending on an Earn-
Out Calculation Date, Buyer shall pay the amount of Earn-Out Consideration, if
any, earned in such period no later than ten (10) days following the final
determination thereof in accordance with this Section 1.8 and _Schedule 1.8_
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller.

  

(d) The right to receive the Earn-Out Consideration, if any, payable pursuant
to this Agreement is a contract right only and no certificate evidencing such
right shall be issued. The right to receive the Earn-Out Consideration, if
any, payable pursuant to this Agreement shall not be transferred or assigned
and no beneficial interests therein may be pledged, sold, assigned or
transferred by Seller, except that (i) Seller may assign or transfer its right
to receive Earn-Out Consideration to the Seller Owner and (ii) heirs and
beneficiaries of a Seller Owner upon death of such Seller Owner shall benefit
from the right to receive the Earn-Out Consideration, subject to the
conditions of receipt of such Earn-Out Consideration by such Seller Owner.

  

 

8  

  

(e) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any payment of Earn-Out
Consideration to Seller shall be (i) treated as additional purchase price
(subject to imputation of interest under Section 483 or 1274 of the Code) or
(ii) deemed to be paid to Seller and then paid by Seller to the SAR Holders in
respect of Stock Appreciation Rights or to Phantom Unitholders in respect of
Company Phantom Units, and Seller intends such amounts to be treated as
compensation subject to applicable withholding tax for which the corresponding
tax deduction inures to the benefit of Seller, although Buyer makes no
covenant, representation or warranty as to such Tax treatment.

with or result in any material violation of or material default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any material
obligation or loss of any material benefit under, or result in the imposition

Organizational Documents in any material respect. _Schedule 2.5(a)_ lists,

All of the Shares are owned of record and, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
beneficially, by the Seller as set forth on _Schedule I_. _Schedule I_ is
accurate and complete. The Shares are owned by the Seller free and clear of
any and all Liens, and upon delivery of the Shares hereunder, Buyer will
acquire good and marketable title thereto, free and clear of any and all

Equity Plan (the " _Plan_ ") and the 2008 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the
" _SARS Plan_ "), neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has ever
adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan or
contract providing for equity compensation to any Person. The Plan and the
SARS Plan have been duly authorized, approved and adopted by the Company Board
and the Company\'s stockholders and are in full force and effect. Each Phantom
Unitholder and SAR Holder

  

 

11  

  

holds that certain number of Company Phantom Units and Stock Appreciation
Rights set forth on _Schedule I_ opposite his name free and clear of all Liens

along" rights) of any Shares, any Company Securities or any Subsidiary
Securities. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions by the Company
does not breach or violate any rights or obligations under the Company\'s
Organizational Documents that have not been complied with or waived. The
holders of shares of Company Securities and Subsidiary Securities and any
Security Right with respect to any of the foregoing have been or will be
properly given or shall have properly waived any required notice prior to the

of their respective Affiliates to engage in any line of business or to compete
or do business with any Person, in each case whether arising as a result of a
change in control of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has (x) entered
into any agreement under which the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates is restricted from selling, licensing,
manufacturing or otherwise distributing any of its technology or products or

Subsidiaries\' or any of their respective Affiliates\' technology or products
in any geographic area or with respect to any customers or potential customers
or any class of customers during

  

 

16  

  

any period of time or in any segment of the market or (z) entered into any
agreement that will bind Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to
Buyer\'s or Buyer\'s Affiliates\' own customers, products or services.

  

2.12. _Real Property; Leases_.

  

(a) None of the real property used or occupied by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, in each case together with all build-out, fixtures and
improvements created thereon (" _Company Real Property_ "), is owned by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, nor has the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries ever owned any real property. All of the Company Real Property is
leased or subleased by the Company or one of the Subsidiaries pursuant to a
Lease set forth on _Schedule 2.12(b)_. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has any right or ownership, right of use, option, right of first
refusal or contractual obligation to purchase, or any other legal or equitable
right, estate or interest in, or affecting, any land or buildings other than
the Leases.

  

(b) _Schedule 2.12(b)_ sets forth all leases, subleases and other agreements
pursuant to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries derives its rights in
the Company Real Property (the " _Leases_ "), including, with respect to each
such Lease, the identity of the landlord or sublandlord, the addresses, the
date of such Lease and each amendment thereto.

  

(c) There does not exist under any Lease any material default by the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, by any other
Person, or any event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a material default by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, by any other Person. No written notice (or to
the actual knowledge of the Key Employees, any other notice) or agreement to
terminate any Lease has been served on the Company or any Subsidiary, or
entered into by any Person with respect thereto. The Company has delivered to
Buyer copies of all Leases that are complete in all material respects,
including all material amendments and agreements related thereto, and the
Leases constitute the entire agreement between the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries and each landlord or sublandlord with respect to the Company Real
Property. All rent and other charges currently due and payable under the
Leases have been paid, except for liabilities reflected or reserved against in
the Company Balance Sheet. There are no matters or restrictions affecting the
Company Real Property or the Leases that would reasonably be expected to
interfere to any material extent with the continued use and occupancy by the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company Real Property for the Company\'s
business.

  

(d) The Company or one of the Subsidiaries is the holder of the tenant\'s
interest under the Leases and has not assigned the Leases or subleased all or
any portion of the premises leased thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries has made any material alterations, additions or improvements
to the premises leased under the Leases that are required to be removed at the
termination of the applicable Lease term.

  

2.13. _Assets; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_.

  

(a) _Schedule 2.13_ sets forth as November 30, 2015 all equipment, materials,
tangible prototypes, tools, supplies, vehicles, furniture, fixtures,

tangible assets (the " _Tangible Assets_ ") of the Company and the
Subsidiaries with amounts that are consistent with the Company\'s
capitalization policy and recorded on the Company Balance Sheet, and sets
forth the original cost and book value of each such asset. The Tangible Assets

conducted and as currently contemplated to be conducted.

  

 

17

in the case of Company Real Property and leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets,
real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear
of any Liens, except as reflected in the Company Balance Sheet and except for
Permitted Liens for ad valorem Taxes not yet due and payable and such
imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, that are not material in
character, amount or extent, and that do not materially detract from the
value, or materially interfere with the present use, of the property subject
thereto or affected thereby.

  

(c) All facilities, machinery, equipment, fixtures, vehicles, and other
personal properties owned, leased or used by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (i) are adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company

all material unregistered software which comprises, or is otherwise included
in or distributed with, any Company Product, in each case owned by or

2.14(a)_ lists any proceedings or actions before any court, tribunal
(including the United States Patent and Trademark Office (" _PTO_ ") or
equivalent authority anywhere in the world) related to any of the Company
Registered Intellectual Property. All Company Registered Intellectual Property
is (to the Knowledge of the Company) valid, and is subsisting and enforceable
and in compliance with all legal requirements (including payment of filing,
examination and maintenance fees and proofs of use). All necessary documents
and certificates in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual
Property have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or
other authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case

Property. There are no actions that must be taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Closing Date,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the
filing of any responses to PTO or foreign, as the case may be, office actions,
documents, applications or certificates for the purpose of obtaining,
maintaining, perfecting or preserving or renewing any Registered Intellectual
Property. To the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances
that would render any Company Registered Intellectual Property invalid or
unenforceable.

  

(b) _Schedule 2.14(b)_ sets forth a true, accurate and complete list of all
licenses, sublicenses, and royalty, escrow, maintenance, support and other
agreements to which the Company and/or any Subsidiary is a party and pursuant

any (A) Company Intellectual Property, or (B) third party Proprietary Rights
that are incorporated in or used by, any of the Company Products or services,
or form a part of any Company Intellectual Property (collectively, the "
_Company Licenses_ "); including but not limited to any licenses granted by
the Company or any Subsidiary to modify, distribute, integrate or bundle any
of the Company Software Products or Software developed or licensed exclusively
by the Company (the " _Company OEM/Reseller Licenses_ "); provided, however,
that customer contracts granting only a non-exclusive, internal-use, end-user
license to object code and any associated support agreements need not be
listed in _Schedule 2.14(b)_. _Schedule 2.14(b)_ also accurately and
completely identifies any Company OEM/Reseller Licenses (1) which are
exclusive in a territory specifying in what territory they are exclusive
and/or (2) under which the third party licensee holds in its possession
inventory of the Company Software Products, specifying the products held in
inventory by name and version number and stating the number of copies of each
such version held in inventory as of the Balance Sheet Date.

Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Lien (whether arising by contract
or by operation of law) and has the right to use all other Proprietary Rights
necessary or required for the conduct of the business of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, as currently conducted, including the development,
marketing and distribution of the existing products of the Company and each
Subsidiary. Except for the Company Licenses, there are no outstanding rights
or options (whether or not currently exercisable), licenses or agreements of
any kind (including, without limitation, any agreement for joint development
and/or joint ownership of Intellectual Property) relating to the Company
Intellectual Property. Except under the Company Licenses, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is obligated to pay any royalties or other compensation
(other than market rate fees for standard Software licenses that are generally
commercially available), to any third party (including, without limitation,
any current or former Employees, consultants or independent contractors) in
respect of its ownership, use or license of any Company Intellectual Property.
To the Company\'s Knowledge, there has been no breach or violation of any
Company License by the Company, any Subsidiary of, or any other party thereto.

  

(d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, as a result of
a Contractual Obligation, materially impair the rights of Buyer or the Company
to use, practice, operate under, license, sublicense, dispose of, or bring
suit for infringement of any of the Company Intellectual Property to the same
extent that the Company and each Subsidiary would have been able to had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments that the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise be
required to pay.

  

(e) None of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, as currently
conducted, nor the services, products or support delivered by the Company or
any Subsidiary to its customers, nor the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s use
of third party products or services, infringes, constitutes the
misappropriation of, or conflicts with, any Proprietary Rights of any third
party (including without limitation due to the use of any Third Party Software
without a valid license or without complying with the restrictions and terms
of a valid license. To the Company\'s Knowledge there is no claim, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever received any written notice or other
written communication (or to the actual knowledge of the Key Employees any (i)
oral notice or (ii) other oral communication) of any claim from, any Person
asserting that the business of the Company or any Subsidiary, as currently
conducted, or any of the services, products or support delivered by the
Company or any Subsidiary to its customers, or any use by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any third party products or services, infringe, constitute the
misappropriation of, or conflict with, any Proprietary Rights of another
Person or constitute unfair competition or trade practice under the laws of
any jurisdiction. To the Company\'s Knowledge there are no existing or
threatened infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition or trade
practice or competing claim by any third party regarding the ownership of or
right to use any Company Intellectual Property. To the Company\'s Knowledge,
no Person is infringing, misappropriating or violating any Proprietary Rights
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(f) _Schedule 2.14(f)_ lists any Software that (i) has been incorporated or
embedded into, or distributed with, any the Company Software Products and (ii)
was not developed by Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in the course
of their employment for the Company or any Subsidiary. No consultants,
contractors, or other third parties (other than Employees of the Company or
any Subsidiary in the course of their employment) have contributed to, or
participated in any respect in the development of, the Company Intellectual
Property.

  

 

19  

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any "open source" or
"copy left" obligations or otherwise required to make any public disclosure or
general availability of source code either used, acquired for use or developed
by the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary uses
any Software that contains, or is derived in any manner from, any software
that is distributed as free software, open source software (e.g., Linux) or
similar licensing or distribution models (collectively, " _Open Source

Mozilla Public License; (iv) the Netscape Public License; (v) the Sun
Community Source License (SCSL); or (vi) the Sun Industry Standards License
(SISL). The Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective consultants,
affiliates, and agents) have not incorporated, bundled, or distributed any
Open Source Software into or with any of the Company Software Products in such
a manner as to cause or require, under the terms of the applicable open source
license agreement for such Open Source Software, (A) all or any portion of
such Company Software Product (other than original Open Source Software) to be
treated as Open Source Software under the terms of such open source license or
(B) the source code of such Company Software Product (other than the original
Open Source Software) to be distributed or provided to licensees in connection
with the licensing or distribution of such Company Software Product. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has incorporated in, or included with, any of
the Company Software Products, or otherwise delivered to any customers, any
Software or any derivative of any Software (A) which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries created and/or delivered to a customer in the course of
performing consulting, implementation, maintenance or other services and (B)
in which such customer has any ownership or other rights other than a
nonexclusive license from the Company or a Subsidiary (regardless whether such
rights were assigned to or vested in such customer).

  

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures
reasonably designed to establish and preserve the ownership of the Company
Intellectual Property or Company Software Products, including the protection
of Trade Secrets. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since
January 1, 2011, all Employees, consultants and independent contractors of the
Company or any Subsidiary who are or were involved in, or who have contributed
to, the creation or development of any Company Intellectual Property Company
Software Products or have otherwise had access to Trade Secrets of the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary have executed and delivered to the Company or any
Subsidiary legally binding confidentiality and assignment of inventions
agreements in form and substance substantially similar to the form of the
Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement included in _Schedule 2.14(i)_.
Copies of such agreements have been made available to Buyer, and all of such
agreements are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is aware of any violation of the confidentiality of any Trade
Secrets comprising Company Intellectual Property or Company Software Products.
None of the Company, any Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Employees, consultants, or independent contractors of the Company or any
Subsidiary have any agreements or arrangements with any former employers
relating to Trade Secrets of such employers that would interfere with the
activities of the Company or any Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the activities of the Employees, consultants, or independent contractors of
the Company or any Subsidiary on behalf of the business of the Company or any
Subsidiary as currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be
conducted do not violate any agreements or arrangements which such Employees
have with former employers or any other third person. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, no current or former Employee, stockholder, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary has any right, claim
or interest in or with respect to any of the Company Intellectual Property or
Company Software Products.

  

(i) The Company Intellectual Property and the Company Software Products
constitute all the Intellectual Property and Software necessary for, developed
or used or held for use in

  

 

20  

  

connection with the operation of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary
as currently conducted and there is no other Intellectual Property or Software
that is material or necessary to the operation of the business of the Company
or any Subsidiary as currently conducted or for the continued operation of the
business of the Company immediately after the Closing in substantially the
same manner as operated immediately prior to the Closing.

  

2.15. _Product Warranties; Services; Support_.

  

(a) Each product (including any software product) or service developed,
manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or delivered by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Products_ ") conforms and has been
in conformity in all material respects with the specifications for such
Company Product, all applicable contractual commitments and all applicable
express and implied warranties. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation (and to the Company\'s
Knowledge, there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand against
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries giving rise to any liability or
obligation) for replacement or repair of any Company Product or other damages
in connection therewith. _Schedule 2.15(a)_ includes a copy of each standard
terms and conditions used for the sale, license, or lease for each of the
Company Products. No Company Product is subject to any guaranty, warranty, or

no reasonable basis for the assertion of any such claim. _Schedule 2.15(b)_
sets forth all agreements that obligate the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
to provide Services after the Agreement Date (the " _Services Agreements_ ").
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any "loss contract" or

become a Loss Contract.

in the form attached to _Schedule 2.15(a)_ , has been executed by the Company
and each applicable counterparty);

  

(xv) leases, financing agreements, subleases or other agreements under which
the Company or any Subsidiary is lessor or lessee of any real or personal

terms. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with and have not breached, violated or defaulted under, or

of all Disclosable Contracts.

  

(ii) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all delivery requirements, time lines, schedules, time of
performance requirements and other milestones under all Disclosable Contracts.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has incurred any significant
cost over-runs on any Disclosable Contract and the Company has no reasonable
basis to believe that it or any of the Subsidiaries will incur any such
significant cost over-runs.

  

2.17. _Change in Control Agreements_. _Schedule 2.17_ sets forth each plan,
agreement or Company Employee Plan of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
(each a " _Change in Control Agreement_ ") (a) pursuant to which any amounts
may become payable (whether currently or in the future) to any Person
(including any Employee) as a result of or in connection with the Transactions
or (b) which provides for the acceleration or early vesting of any right or
benefit or lapse of any restriction as a result of or in connection with the
Transactions, to which the Transactions constitute a partial or "single
trigger."

  

2.18. _Interested Party Transactions_.

  

(a) To the Company\'s Knowledge, no Seller Owner, officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary nor any affiliate of any such person, now has or

actively involved with any person that competes directly with the Company or
any Subsidiary.

  

 

23  

  

2.19. _Compliance with Laws_.

  

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is or has been in violation of any
applicable Law (including, without limitation, Laws relating to environmental
matters, employment practices, occupational safety, Tax, import/export or
corrupt practices) of any Governmental Entity or regulatory body applicable to
its business or assets, except for any such violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written (or to the actual
knowledge of the Key Employees, oral) notice or communication from any
Governmental Entity of any such violation or noncompliance, and there has been
no citation, fine or penalty imposed against the Company or any Subsidiary for
any such violation of such Laws.

the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no facts, threats, claims or allegations
that would reasonably be expected to result in any such threatened or pending
action, suit proceeding or investigation. None of the Company, the
Subsidiaries or their respective properties is subject to any order that
materially impairs the Company\'s or any of the Subsidiaries\' ability to
operate. _Schedule 2.20_ lists each action, suit or proceeding that has been
commenced by or against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in the three
(3) year period preceding the Agreement Date.

  

2.21. _Insurance_. _Schedule 2.21_ sets forth all insurance policies and
fidelity bonds covering the assets, business, equipment, properties,
operations and Employees of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates, including the type of coverage, the carrier, the amount of
coverage, the term and the annual premiums of such policies. There is no claim
by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates pending
under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed. There is no pending claim that would reasonably be
expected to exceed the policy limits. All premiums due and payable under all
such policies and bonds have been paid (or if installment payments are due,
will be paid if incurred prior to the Closing) and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates are otherwise in material compliance with
the terms of such policies and bonds. None of the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates has ever maintained, established,

otherwise a danger to health or the environment, including PCBs, asbestos,

pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or defined as a hazardous waste pursuant to
the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and
the regulations promulgated pursuant to said Laws (a " _Hazardous Material_
"), but excluding office and janitorial supplies properly and safely
maintained. No Hazardous Materials are present, as a result of the actions of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, as a
result of any actions of any third party or otherwise, in, on or under any
property, including the land and the improvements, ground water and surface

Buyer\'s counsel not less than 10 Business Days following the Agreement Date.

  

2.25. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

(a) _Schedule_. _Schedule 2.25(a)_ sets forth each Company Employee Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any stated plan, intention
or commitment to establish any new Company Employee Plan, to modify or
terminate any Company Employee Plan (except to the extent required by Law or
to conform any such Company Employee Plan to the requirements of any
applicable Law, in each case as previously disclosed to Buyer in writing, or
as required by this Agreement), or to enter into any new Company Employee
Plan.

  

(b) _Employee Plan Documents_. The Company has delivered to Buyer (i) correct
and complete copies of each Company Employee Plan or related trust, including
all amendments thereto (or, if such Company Employee Plan is not written, an
accurate description of the material terms thereof); (ii) the most recent
annual actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each Company Employee Plan;
(iii) the most recent annual report (Series 5500 and all schedules thereto),
if any, required under ERISA or the Code, or any similar Laws of other
jurisdictions applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, in
connection with each Company Employee Plan or related trust; (iv) if any
Company Employee Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic
accounting of Company Employee Plan assets; (v) the most recent summary plan

Plan from the IRS or any similar Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries relating to

  

 

25  

  

Company Employee Plans and copies of all applications and correspondence
(including specifically any correspondence regarding actual or potential
audits or investigations) to or from the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan, (vii) all material written
agreements and contracts relating to each Company Employee Plan, including
fidelity or ERISA bonds, administrative service agreements, group annuity
contracts and group insurance contracts; (viii) all communications material to
any Employee or Employees relating to any Company Employee Plan and any
proposed Company Employee Plans, in each case relating to any amendments,
terminations, establishments, increases or decreases in benefits, acceleration
of payments or vesting schedules or other events that would result in any
material liability to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and that are not
reflected in the current summary plan description and plan document; (ix) all
material forms and notices relating to the provision of post-employment
continuation of health coverage; (x) all policies pertaining to fiduciary
liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of each Company Employee Plan;

Laws of other jurisdictions applicable to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries and all attachments thereto) and prospectuses prepared in
connection with each Company Employee Plan.

  

(c) _Employee Plan Compliance_. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has
performed all material obligations required to be performed by it under each
Company Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been established and
maintained in accordance with its terms and in all material respects in
compliance with all applicable Laws, including Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, ERISA and the Code. Each Company Employee Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and each
trust that is intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has either received a favorable determination letter or opinion
letter from the IRS with respect to such Company Employee Plan as to its
qualified status under the Code or has a period of time remaining under
applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
and obtain such a letter, and nothing has occurred as to any such Company
Employee Plan which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation of
such qualification or which requires or could require action under the
compliance resolution programs of the IRS to preserve such qualification. No
Company Employee Plan and no party in interest with respect thereto has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction," which could subject the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to liability under Section 4975 of
the Code or Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA. There are no actions, suits,
claims or proceedings pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened
(other than routine claims for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan or
fiduciary thereto or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan nor, to
the Company\'s Knowledge, is there any reasonable basis therefor. The Company
has not undertaken to maintain any Company Employee Plan for any period of
time and each Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise
discontinued on or after the Closing Date in accordance with its terms,
without liability to the Company, any of the Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of its
ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses typically
incurred in a termination event). There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened by the IRS,
DOL or any other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan. All annual
reports and other filings required by the IRS, DOL or any other similar
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries have been timely made. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or Tax with
respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 501(i) of ERISA or Section
4975 through 4980D of the Code or any similar Laws of other jurisdictions
applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and no Company Employee
Plan is sponsored or maintained by any Person that is or was considered to be
a co-employer with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

  

 

26  

  

(d) _Plan Status_. None of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate now, or has ever, maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in or contributed to any plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code. None of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred, nor do they reasonably expect to incur, any liability
with respect to any transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA. No Company
Employee Plan is a multiple employer plan as defined in Section 210 of ERISA
or any similar concept under any other applicable Law.

  

(e) _Multiemployer Plans_. At no time has the Company, any of the Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate contributed to or been requested to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or any similar
concept under any other applicable Law.

  

(f) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan provides, or
has any liability to provide, life insurance, medical or other employee
welfare benefits to any Employee upon or after his or her retirement or
termination of employment for any reason, except as may be required by Law,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either
individually or to Employees as a group) that such Employee(s) would be
provided with life insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits upon
or after their retirement or termination of employment, except to the extent
required by Law.

  

(g) _Funding of Plans_. With respect to each Company Employee Plan for which a
separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full and timely
payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, under the terms of each such Company Employee Plan or applicable
Law, as applied through the Closing Date. The current value of the assets of
each such Company Employee Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan
year of that Company Employee Plan, equals or exceeds the current value of all
benefits liabilities under that Company Employee Plan.

  

(h) _Effect of Transactions_. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and any Related Agreement to which the Company is a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions, will not conflict with or
result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under
any Company Employee Plan, trust or loan that would reasonably be expected to
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee.

  

(i) _Foreign Jurisdictions_. No Company Employee Plan is subject to the Laws
of any jurisdiction outside of the United States.

  

(j) _Taxation_. Each Company Employee Plan has been properly classified with
respect to the payment of Taxes, including in particular social security
payments and contributions, and any exemptions have been properly applied and
all filings have been completed accurately and in a timely manner with the
appropriate Tax Authorities.

  

(k) _Discretion_. Each Company Employee Plan that is deemed to be
discretionary can be suspended or interrupted at any time at the Company\'s or
the relevant Subsidiary\'s discretion, and has not created any rights or
obligations, either from past practice or restrictions under the Employment
Agreements or otherwise, that would in any way limit the right of the Company
or the

  

 

27  

  

relevant Subsidiary to vary, suspend, reduce, amend, terminate or otherwise
change any current or future payments under any such discretionary Company
Employee Plan.

  

2.26. _Employment Matters_.

  

(a) _Schedule 2.26(a)_ sets forth, (i) with respect to each current Employee
(including any Employee who is on a leave of absence of any nature, paid or

or "contract laborer" or "independent contractor" and whether the Company or
any Subsidiary is party to a consulting or contract labor or independent
contractor agreement with the individual or an entity with which such
individual is an Employee. Any such agreements have been delivered to Buyer
and are set forth on _Schedule 2.26(b)_.

  

(c) None of the Seller, the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to
any agreement, arrangement, or plan (including the Plan, any Company Employee

that has resulted or would result, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event) separately or in the aggregate, in the payment
of (i) any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code (without regard to the exceptions set forth in Sections 280G(b)(4)
and 280G(b)(5) of the Code) or (ii) any amount for which a deduction would be
disallowed or deferred under Section 162 or Section 404 of the Code. None of
the shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the
meaning of Section 83 of the Code. No portion of the Purchase Price is subject
to the Tax withholding provisions of Section 3406 of the Code, or of
Subchapter A of Chapter 3 of the Code or of any other provision of Law. Within
seven (7) calendar days from the Agreement Date, the Company shall provide
Buyer with _Schedule 2.26(c)_ listing each person who is a disqualified
individual within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  

(d) Each Employment Agreement in effect as of the Agreement Date, other than

are set forth on _Schedule 2.26(d)(iii)_ ) neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has, and to the Company\'s Knowledge, no other Person on behalf
of the Company has, (i) entered into any agreement that obligates or purports
to obligate Buyer or any of Buyer\'s Affiliates to make an offer of employment
to any Employee, consultant or contractor of the Company or any of the

Filings or by any other Governmental Entity

  

 

42  

  

relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Buyer, the Company and Seller

(directly or through its representatives) any inquiry or investigation by, or
any material meeting or conference (whether by telecommunications or in
person) with, any Governmental Entity relating to the HSR Act Filings, this
Agreement or the Transactions if, in the reasonable judgment of the party that
is subject to the inquiry, investigation, meeting or conference, such

agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure termination or
expiration of any waiting periods under the HSR Act and/or to obtain the
approval of any antitrust Governmental Entity, as applicable, for the

or transfer of all or a material portion of the assets of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries (any of the transactions described in clauses (A) through

or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt by any Person to do or seek, a Third-Party Acquisition.

notice were omitted due to such confidentiality obligations.

  

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 5.10 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties that Buyer shall be entitled to seek an immediate injunction or
injunctions without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 5.10 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state or any other jurisdiction having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth above by any of Seller, a Seller Owner, the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries or by any of their respective Representatives
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company and Seller.

  

5.11. _No Post-Closing Competition or Solicitation_.

  

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the three (3)
year anniversary thereof, Seller and the Seller Owners shall not, and shall
not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i)
engage in or assist others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the

(iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Buyer, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (including any existing or former client or customer of the
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that becomes a
client or customer of the Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries after
the Closing), or any other Person who has a material business relationship
with the Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, to terminate or modify
any such actual or prospective relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) any Seller Owner may perform duties as an employee or consultant of the
Company or Buyer, (ii) each of Seller and the Seller Owners may own, directly
or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any

securities of such Person and (iii) each Seller Owner may continue to conduct
the activities set forth on _Schedule 5.11_.

agrees to not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any Employee of
Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates; provided, that general
advertisements (and any discussions based upon responses thereto) shall not be
deemed to be a breach of the non-solicitation restriction in this provision.

  

(c) In the event that any part of this Section 5.11 or the application thereof
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Section 5.11 will continue in
full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons
or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto and, to the extent applicable, shall be curtailed, as to
time or location or both, only to the minimum extent required for its validity
and enforceability under the governing law of this Agreement and shall be
binding and enforceable with respect to the Seller and the Seller Owners, as
so curtailed.

of this Section 5.11 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate
business interests of Buyer and its investment in the goodwill of and in the
Company and the Subsidiaries. The restrictive covenants contained in this
Section 5.11 are covenants independent of any other provision of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement between the parties hereunder and the
existence of any claim that Seller or any Seller Owner may allege against
Buyer under any other provision of this Agreement or any Related Agreement
will not prevent enforcement of these covenants. Without intending to limit
the remedies available to Buyer, Seller and each Seller Owner acknowledges
that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 5.11 will
result in material irreparable injury to Buyer for which there is no adequate
remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such
injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof,
Buyer shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or a
preliminary or permanent injunction, without the necessity of proving
irreparable harm or injury as a result of such breach or threatened breach of
this Section 5.11, restraining Seller or any Seller Owner from engaging in
activities prohibited by this Section 5.11 or such other relief as may be
required specifically to enforce any of the covenants in this Section 5.11.

  

5.12. _Section 280G Approval_. If the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated
to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain
circumstances could obligate it to make any payments, that will not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code if the stockholder approval
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not satisfied, then the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
stockholder approval as promptly as is practicable after

  

 

45  

  

the Agreement Date and in any event prior to the Closing Date. Although the
Company does not believe that 280G is applicable, the Company agrees to obtain
all necessary consents as requested by Buyer as though Section 280G applies.

  

5.13. _Tax Matters_.

to filing for Buyer\'s review and comment, any such comment to be considered
in good faith by Seller.

their Affiliates\' receipt of any such refund (or credit for overpayment),
Buyer shall pay over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, any
such refund (or the amount of any such credit), including any interest
thereon, to Seller. Buyer shall take any action necessary for the Company or
the Subsidiaries to promptly receive such refunds and cause the Company or the
Subsidiaries to claim such refunds within the statutorily required time
period.

  

(f) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer, in connection with the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return of the Company or the Subsidiaries, any inquiry,
investigation, claim assessment, audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and, upon Buyer\'s request, the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such enquiry, investigation,
claim assessment, audit, litigation or other proceeding and access to
Employees on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Seller (to the
extent applicable) agree to (i) retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Entity and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Buyer and Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.

  

(g) _Tax Certificates_. Buyer and Seller agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or customer of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including but not limited to with
respect to the Transactions).

  

(h) _Tax Contests_. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing within a commercially
reasonable amount of time after receipt by Buyer or the Company of any notice
of any Tax enquiry, investigation, audit or other Tax dispute or contest
relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or for which Seller or the Seller Owners could be obligated
to indemnify Buyer or that relate to a Tax refund or credit to which Seller
and the Seller Owners are entitled under Section 5.13(e) (a " _Tax Contest_
"), _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the notified party to give
any other party notice as provided herein shall not relieve such other party
of its indemnification obligations under Article VII. Seller shall have the
right to exercise control at any time over the handling, disposition and/or
settlement of any issue raised in any Tax Contest pertaining to a Tax period
ending prior to or on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Contest and Seller shall not
settle any issue in such Tax Contest without the prior consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller, as reasonably requested by Seller, in any such
Tax Contest. Buyer shall have the right to exercise control at any time over
the handling, disposition and/or settlement of any Tax Contest pertaining to a
Straddle Period; provided, however, that Seller shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Contest and Buyer shall not settle any issue in such
Tax Contest pertaining to any Seller indemnifiable Tax without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably

  

 

47  

  

withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any conflict arises
between the provisions of this Section 5.13(g) and the provisions of Section
7.4, the provisions of this Section 5.13(g) shall govern.

  

(i) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause all tax allocation agreements
or tax sharing agreements with respect to each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to be terminated as of the Closing Date.

  

(j) _Apportionment_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes
of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are payable with respect to any Tax
period that begins before or on and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the portion of any Taxes that are attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or
related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period
ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those
described in clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to the business or assets of the Company of any of the Subsidiaries or
otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax
based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section
5.13, shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The parties hereto
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax
Authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period
ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

(k) _Tax Treatment of Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. As a result of the
U.S. federal income (and, to the extent applicable, state and local) Tax
classification of the Company as a Qsub, the parties hereto agree to treat the
transfer of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement as the purchase by Buyer of
the assets of the Company and an assumption by Buyer of the liabilities of the
Company for U.S. federal income (and, to the extent applicable, state and
local) Tax purposes followed by the deemed formation of a new corporation and
a deemed transfer of the assets and liabilities to the new corporation, and
shall prepare all Tax books, records and filings in a manner consistent with
such Tax treatment and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith. To
the extent required by Law, the Seller Owners shall timely file Tax Returns
reflecting, and pay associated Taxes resulting from, the Reorganization and
the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

  

5.14. _Plan_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate the Plan and the SARS Plan, effective as of immediately
prior to the Closing.

  

5.15. _Indemnification of Company Board and Officers; Insurance_.

  

(a) _Indemnification Obligations_. During the period ending six (6) years
after the Closing Date, (i) all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to the
Company\'s Organizational Documents as in effect on the Agreement Date in
favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
Agreement Date or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or
director of the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Company Indemnitees_ ")
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms, and (ii) the Company or its successor shall, and the Buyer shall cause
the Company or its

  

 

48  

  

successor to, fulfill and honor in all respects all such rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company in
favor of the Company Indemnitees.

  

(b) _Insurance_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Company\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance coverage in a form acceptable
to Buyer that shall provide the members of the Company Board and the
Company\'s officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date
of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially
less favorable to the insured persons than the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company
(the " _Extended D andOs Coverage_").

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.15 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnitees and their respective
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. No party to this
Agreement shall take any action as to materially and adversely affect any
Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.15 applies without the prior
written consent of such Company Indemnitee.

  

(d) In the event the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the Company, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.15.

  

5.16. _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of (a) all members of the Company Board and all officers of the
Company effective as of the Closing and (b) such officers and directors of
each of the Subsidiaries as Buyer designates in writing effective as of the
date such resignation is accepted by the Company.

  

5.17. _RELEASE AND WAIVER_. EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CLOSING, SELLER AND EACH
SELLER OWNER HEREBY RELEASES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE COMPANY, THE
SUBSIDIARIES, THE BUYER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, STOCKHOLDERS, AGENTS,

_RELEASED PARTIES_ ") FROM ANY AND ALL LEGAL, EQUITABLE OR OTHER CLAIMS,
WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, WITH RESPECT TO ITS
OWNERSHIP OF ANY EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMPANY (INCLUDING ANY COMPANY
SECURITY OR ANY COMPANY STOCK RIGHTS) OR ANY MATTER RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING
ANY MATTER ARISING UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTOR AGREEMENTS, EXCEPT
FOR ANY CLAIMS SELLER OR ANY SELLER OWNER HAS OR MAY HAVE AFTER THE CLOSING
AGAINST BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

  

5.18. _Employment and Benefits Arrangements_.

  

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
effective date of an Employee\'s termination of employment with the Company or
its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide each Employee (other than the Key Employees and any
other Employee who executes any Offer Package Agreement prior to the Agreement
Date, for which the terms of this Section shall not apply) who remains
employed immediately after the Closing (each a " _Company Continuing Employee_
") with standard employee benefits offered by Buyer to its employees of
comparable status; _provided_ that, until such time as Continuing Employees
participate

  

 

49  

  

in employee benefit plans provided by the Buyer from time to time, the
Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in the Company Employee
Plans.

  

(b) Buyer shall recognize as of the Closing all accrued but unused vacation
and sick pay of the Employees on _Schedule 5.18(b)_ ; provided, such time
shall be utilized by such Employee prior to the end of Buyer\'s current fiscal
year. For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee benefit plans
of the Buyer other than the Company Employee Plans (the " _New Plans_ "), and
for purposes of accrual of vacation and severance benefits under applicable
New Plans, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service recognized by the Company before the Closing, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Employee Plan to the extent permitted by
Law. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Buyer shall take
commercially reasonable efforts to: (A) cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (B) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Employee Plan during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs to be taken into account under any corresponding New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been incurred
under and in accordance with such New Plan.

  

(c) Buyer is under no obligation to retain any Employee, independent
contractor or consultant, or provide any Employee, independent contractor or
consultant with any particular benefits.

  

(d) This Section 5.18 is not intended to amend any benefit plans or programs
of Buyer.

  

5.19. _Incentive Bonus Amount_. Subject to the terms set forth in _Schedule
5.19_ , Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the Incentive Bonus Amount at the
times, to the persons and in the amounts set forth on such schedule.

the Related Agreements and any consummation of the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Related Agreements. In that capacity, Goodwin has
engaged or may engage in communications with (i) other counsel to Seller and
the Company, (ii) Seller, (iii) Seller Owners, (iv) the Company, and (v)
advisors and consultants to any of the foregoing that relate to the
negotiation, documentation or consummation of the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Related Agreements (" _Deal Communications_ ").

interest arising from or in connection with (i) Goodwin\'s prior
representation of the Company and (ii) Goodwin\'s representation of Seller and
its Affiliates prior to and after the Closing.

  

 

50  

  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.20(e)_ , Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, acknowledge and agree that the information relating to or arising
out of the legal advice or services that have been or will be provided prior
to the Closing Date for the benefit of both (i) Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Company) and (ii) the Company, shall be subject to a shared
privilege between Seller and such Affiliates (other than the Company), on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, and, subject to the immediately
following sentence, Seller and such Affiliates and the Company shall have
equal right to assert all such shared privileges in connection with privileged
information under any Law and no such shared privilege may be waived after the
Closing by (A) Seller or its Affiliates without the prior written consent of
Buyer or the Company or (B) by the Company, Buyer or any of their respective
affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller.

  

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees and
affiliates, that all Deal Communications shall be deemed to be retained, owned
and controlled collectively by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer or, following the Closing, the Company, even if such Deal Communications
are in the Company\'s possession. All Deal Communications that are subject to
the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product privilege shall
remain privileged after the Closing (the " _Privileged Deal Communications_
"), with the privilege belonging solely to Seller and not Buyer.

  

(e) In the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or the Company and a
third party, Buyer and the Company shall assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent the disclosure of Privileged Deal Communications to such third
party. In the event that Buyer is asked by any third party, for example in
connection with a Third-Party Claim, to access or obtain any of the Privileged
Deal Communications, Buyer shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5)
Business Days) notify Seller in writing (including by making specific
reference to this _Section 5.20(e)_. Buyer further agrees to use commercially

respective best efforts following the Agreement Date to (a) complete to the
Buyer\'s reasonable satisfaction the security remediation and related
activities set forth on Schedule II, and (b) cooperate with the Buyer\'s

remediation and related activities.

  

5.22. _Corporate Existence; Good Standing; No Dissolution_. For a period of
not less than six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Seller (i) shall
maintain its corporate existence in good standing, perform its obligations and
satisfy its liabilities when due, pay its Taxes when due, and maintain
adequate cash and liquid assets to pay and perform its liabilities and
obligations as they fall due, and (ii) shall not resolve, agree or take any
action to liquidate, wind-up, dissolve or otherwise cease its operations.

or otherwise required to be paid by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries

be true and correct in all respects (disregarding any disclosure made in the
corresponding Company Disclosure Schedule) and (B) associated with discharging
any obligation or otherwise relating to or arising from the performance of any
action set forth in Section 6.2(n); or

  

(x) the matters set forth on Schedule II (disregarding any disclosure made in
the Company Disclosure Schedule).

  

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be the initial source of recourse available to
reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.2 and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not proceed directly against any Seller Owner
individually with respect to any indemnification claim pursuant to this
Article VII unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have pending and
unsatisfied claims for Losses with respect to the entire amount of the Escrow
Fund then being held by the Escrow Agent. For clarity, indemnifiable Losses
subject to the limitation under _Section 7.3(b)(i)_ below shall be satisfied
solely out of the Escrow Amount and the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to all such Losses shall be recovery against
the Escrow Amount.

  

(c) Subject to the remainder of this _Article VII_ , after the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Seller and the Seller
Owners (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and together with the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller or any Seller Owner directly or
indirectly, as a result of, with respect to or in connection with any breach
or violation of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

  

7.3. _Limitations_.

  

(a) _Threshold Amount_. No claim may be made by any Buyer Indemnified Party
for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to
a Fundamental Representation or the IP Representations) unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses for which such Buyer Indemnified Parties seek to be
indemnified pursuant to such section exceeds $500,000, at which time such
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to the amount of all such Losses
only in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate.

  

 

57  

  

(b) _Caps_. Each Seller Owner\'s indemnification obligations under Section 7.2
are subject to the following limitations:

  

(i) Except as expressly provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section
7.3(b), each Seller Owner\'s aggregate liability for all Losses indemnifiable
under Section 7.2(a)shall not exceed such Seller Owner\'s Pro Rata Share of
the Escrow Amount;

  

(ii) Each Seller Owner\'s aggregate liability for all Losses arising out of a
breach of any IP Representations shall not exceed such Seller Owner\'s Pro
Rata Share of $20,000,000; and

  

(iii) Each Seller Owner\'s aggregate liability for all Losses indemnifiable
under Sections 7.2(a)(i)(with respect to any Fundamental Representation only),
7.2(a)(iv), 7.2(a)(vii) and Section 7.2(a)(vi) (but, with respect to Section
7.2(a)(vi), only if the claims that are the subject matter thereof, if true,
would entitle a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to Section
7.2(a)(i) for the breach of a Fundamental Representation), shall not exceed an
amount equal to (v) (I) the Purchase Price (less the Escrow Amount and
excluding all Earn Out Consideration) multiplied by (II) such Seller Owner\'s
percentage ownership of Seller as set forth on Schedule I (if any), plus (w)
the total payments actually received by such Seller Owner at Closing in its
capacity as a Phantom Unitholder (if any), plus, (x) the total payments
actually received by such Seller Owner at Closing in its capacity as an SAR
Holder (if any), plus (y) such Seller Owner\'s Pro Rata Share of the Earn-Out
Consideration actually received by Seller (if any), plus (z) such Seller
Owner\'s Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, net in case of each of (v)
through (y) of Taxes paid by Seller or Seller Owner on the amounts so
received.

  

(c) _Exclusive Remedy for Monetary Damages_. Subject to Section 7.3(d), Buyer
agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matter
arising under this Agreement or any certificate, document or other instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the Related Agreements shall be the
rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement and the rights set forth
in Article VIII.

  

(d) _Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
limitations and thresholds and other provisions set forth in this Article VII
shall not apply with respect to (i) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful breach or misconduct or (ii) any equitable remedy, including a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance; _provided_ , that
no claim of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or
misconduct may be brought pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to five (5)
years after the Closing Date and any other claim with respect to the matters
in clause (i) above brought subsequent to the five (5) years after the Closing
shall be subject to the survival periods, limitations, thresholds and other
provisions set forth in this Article VII. No Seller Owner shall have any
liability for the fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful breach or
willful misconduct of any other Seller Owner, unless such Seller Owner has
actual knowledge of such fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful breach
or willful misconduct of any other Seller Owner; provided, that solely with
respect to fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful breach or willful
misconduct arising out of any breach of the covenants set forth in Section
5.11, no Seller Owner shall have any liability for such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful breach or willful misconduct of any other Seller
Owner if such Seller Owner promptly advises the Buyer in writing after such
Seller Owner first obtains actual knowledge thereof.

  

(e) _Set-off_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3, if at
any time there shall be an outstanding claim for indemnification that exceeds
the Escrow Fund then available, Buyer shall have the right to withhold from,
reduce, set-off against and retain from any required payments of Earn-Out
Consideration to Seller, the good faith estimate of any indemnification to
which a

  

 

58  

  

Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled hereunder; provided that if the final
amount of Losses for such claim is less than the amount by which the portion
of the Earn-Out Consideration was withheld, reduced, set-off or retained, then
Buyer shall make payment of such difference in accordance with Section 1.8 to
Seller; provided further, however, that Buyer shall not set off any Losses
(but may withhold any such payment) for which it may be entitled until such
claim has been finally resolved in accordance with this Article VII.

  

(f) _Limitation of Liabilities_. UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY PAID TO A
THIRD PARTY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE VII IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-
PARTY CLAIM, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY OR OTHER PERSON
FOR (I) ANY SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS AND
OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND OR (II) PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH PARTY WILL BE ADVISED, WILL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT WILL
KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.

  

(g) _Reduction for Insurance_. The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under this Article VII shall be reduced by the amount by which
(a) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party relating
to such Loss exceeds (b) the amount of expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in procuring such insurance recovery, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses and any increased premiums or costs as a result of such claim for
which insurance proceeds are received.

  

(h) _Mitigation_. Each party shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the Losses that any such party reasonably expects will result from an
event or circumstance for which it may seek indemnification hereunder (it
being understood that nothing herein shall limit the right to seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to any costs of such mitigation) upon
becoming aware of any such event or circumstance which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto; _provided_ that the Indemnifier shall
not be required to materially alter its conduct in connection therewith.
Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve either party of any common Law or
other duty to mitigate any loss, liability or damage suffered by it.

  

(i) _No Duplication of Recovery_. Losses shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation. To the extent that a portion of any
indemnifiable Loss is specifically included as a liability in the calculation
of Net Working Capital or the Final Purchase Price, then the amount
specifically included as a liability will be subtracted from the total
indemnifiable Losses payable in respect of such indemnifiable Loss. For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the Buyer nor the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification for any Loss to the extent such Loss consists
of liabilities that were included in the determination of the Final Purchase
Price.

  

7.4. _Procedures_.

  

(a) An Indemnified Party with respect to a Claim brought by a third-party (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") will give the party or parties required to provide such
indemnification (the " _Indemnifier_ ") prompt written notice of any legal
proceeding, claim or demand instituted by any third party (in each case, a "
_Claim_ ") in respect of which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that the failure to provide prompt
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnifier

  

 

59  

  

is actually and materially prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnified Party
to provide such prompt notice.

  

(b) If the Indemnifier provides written notice to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) days after the Indemnifier\'s receipt of written notice from the
Indemnified Party of such Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at the
Indemnifier\'s expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Claim and to have the Indemnified Party represented by counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, selected by the Indemnifier;
_provided_ that (i) the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding
with counsel of its choice and at its expense, (ii) the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, at any time when the Buyer believes in good faith that any Claim
is having or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse effect on Buyer, or involves a Tax liability for
a post-Closing period, or an IP Representation may assume the defense and
otherwise deal with such Claim in good faith, with counsel of its choice,
(iii) Buyer, at any time when Buyer reasonably believes in good faith that a
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
matter, may assume the defense and otherwise deal with such Claim in good
faith with counsel of its choice, (iv) the Indemnifier may not assume the
defense of any Claim if a material conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party that precludes effective joint
representation or the amount of any claims exceeds or reasonably could exceed
the limitations set forth in Section 7.3(b), if applicable, and (v) the
Indemnified Party may take over the defense and prosecution of a Claim from
the Indemnifier if the Indemnifier has failed or is failing to diligently
prosecute or defend such Claim following the provision of written notice to
the Indemnifier of such failure and the failure of the Indemnifier to cure
such failure within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice; and
_provided_ , _further_ that the Indemnifier may not enter into a settlement of
any Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless such settlement
provides the Indemnified Party with a full release from such Claim and
requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is
fully indemnified. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, neither the Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates may
settle or otherwise dispose of any Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifier
may have a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense or is otherwise
negotiating any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifier may participate in any
proceeding or negotiation with counsel of its choice and at its expense.

  

(c) By executing this Agreement each Seller Owner hereby appoints, as of the
Agreement Date, the Seller, as his, her or its true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact to enter into any Related Agreement and any transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including other agreements in connection with
the Transactions), and to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to
or from Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Buyer Indemnified Party)
and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any of the Transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby
(except to the extent that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly
contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or received
by the Seller Owner individually); (ii) authorize deliveries (including by
means of not objecting to claims) to Buyer of cash from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims asserted by Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party, including by not objecting to claims thereto) and
authorize payments to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; (iii) object to any claims by Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party, including any claims to the Escrow Fund; (iv) consent or
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to

awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Party against any Seller Owner or by any Seller

  

 

60  

  

Owner against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified
Party and any Seller Owner, in each case relating to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (vi)
amend this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other Related Agreement or
any other agreement referred to herein or contemplated hereby; and (vii) take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Seller for the
accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain
the consent of any Person under any circumstance. Seller hereby accepts such
appointment. Each Seller Owner acknowledges that Buyer is relying and shall
rely on the authority of the Seller granted hereunder and will be materially
prejudiced if this authority is revoked. Each Seller Owner hereby agrees that
it shall indemnify Buyer and each other Buyer Indemnified Party for any Losses
suffered by Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of a
revocation by such Seller Owner of the authority granted hereunder other than
as provided for herein.

  

7.5. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Buyer, Seller and each Seller
Owner agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this Article VII

position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law
pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

7.6. _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Seller Owner shall have any
right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, any Buyer Indemnified Party or the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries with respect to any indemnification payment by or on behalf of
any Seller Owner under Section 7.2 if the Transactions are consummated.

Subsidiary\'s ownership or operation of any material portion of the business
of Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries;

  

 

61

Agreement, the Related Agreements, the schedules and Exhibits hereto and
thereto, the Company Disclosure Schedules, and the documents and instruments

among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

10.3. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

  

10.4. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction

Earn-Out Consideration, or to maximize the amount of any Earn-Out
Consideration.

  

(b) Seller acknowledges that (i) there is no assurance that the Seller will
receive any Earn-Out Consideration and Buyer has not promised or projected any
Earn-Out Consideration, and (ii) the parties solely intend the express
provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual relationship.

  

10.6. _Expenses_.

  

(a) In the event the Transactions are not consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, including all legal, accounting,

(b) No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations

under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to benefit
the Indemnified Parties, the Released Parties and the Company Indemnitees and

provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to
any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and assigns,
if any.

  

10.8. _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

  

10.9. _Governing Law; Venue_.

brought pursuant to this section.

  

 

77
