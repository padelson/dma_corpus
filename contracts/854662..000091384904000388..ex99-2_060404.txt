                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 5th day of June, 2004, by and among MAF Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser"), Classic Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), and Chesterfield
Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - -

         WHEREAS, the parties desire that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), as a result of which the Company will be the surviving
corporate entity, with the Merger to be upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company deems the Merger
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has
adopted a resolution approving this Agreement and directing that this Agreement
be submitted for the consideration of the Company's stockholders.

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and Merger Sub
have adopted resolutions approving this Agreement, and Purchaser, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Purchaser intends to cause
the Surviving Corporation (as defined herein) to be dissolved and liquidated
into Purchaser.

         WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, Purchaser and the Company
intend that Chesterfield Federal Savings and Loan Association of Chicago, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Bank"), shall merge (the "Bank
Merger") with and into Mid America Bank, fsb, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Purchaser ("Mid America") immediately following consummation of the merger.

         WHEREAS, immediately following the Bank Merger, Purchaser intends to
cause Mid America to declare and pay a dividend to Purchaser in the amount up to
approximately $65 million to partially fund the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                       I.

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1 Effects of the Merger

         (a) Surviving Corporation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger, pursuant to
which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the

<PAGE>

Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Purchaser, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall be governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Laws ("DGCL") and as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and in accordance therewith. The Surviving Corporation shall possess
all assets and property of every description, and every interest in the assets
and property, contingent or otherwise, wherever located, and the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority, of a public as well as
a private nature, of each of the Company and Merger Sub, and all obligations
belonging or due to either of the Company or Merger Sub, all of which shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation without further act or deed.

         (b) Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company with such changes, if any, as may be provided for in the Certificate
of Merger (as defined herein) shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and the DGCL.

         (c) By-laws. The By-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
altered, amended or repealed as provided therein, or in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the DGCL.

         (d) Directors and Officers. The directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the persons who were directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

         1.2 Conversion of Shares upon the Merger. At the Effective Time (as
defined herein), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Purchaser Common Stock (as
defined below), Merger Sub Common Stock (as defined below) or Company Common
Stock (as defined below), the following shall occur:

         (a) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of the Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation and all such shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation shall be owned by Purchaser.
Outstanding certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Merger shall be deemed to represent an identical number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation upon consummation of the
Merger.

         (b) Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 1.2(c), Section 1.2(d) and
Section 1.5(c), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a combination of
cash and shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
("Purchaser Common Stock") (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), the
combined value of which shall equal $31.50 per share of Company Common Stock, to
be determined as follows:

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  (i) an amount in cash (the "Per Share Cash Consideration")
         equal to $20.48, or such greater portion of the Merger Consideration as
         Purchaser may determine to pay in cash; provided, however, that in the
         event Purchaser proposes to pay more than $20.48 of the Merger
         Consideration in cash, Purchaser must first provide the Company notice
         of the proposed cash amount no later than fifteen (15) business days
         prior to the Closing Date and the Company shall have consented to such
         greater amount, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
         provided, further, that if the Company does not object within three (3)
         business days of receipt from Purchaser of any such notice, the Per
         Share Cash Consideration shall be the greater amount proposed by
         Purchaser; plus

                  (ii) a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of the
         common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Purchaser ("Purchaser Common
         Stock"), determined by dividing (x) the amount obtained by subtracting
         the Per Share Cash Consideration from $31.50, by (y) the Purchaser
         Closing Price. For purposes hereof, the "Purchaser Closing Price" shall
         mean the average of the last reported sales price on The Nasdaq
         National Market ("Nasdaq") for Purchaser Common Stock as reported on
         Nasdaq for the ten (10) trading days next preceding (the first of such
         10 days herein referred to as, the "Pricing Commencement Date"), but
         not including, the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not, within three (3)
         days of the Pricing Commencement Date and through the Effective Time,
         declare or establish a record date for a stock split, stock dividend,
         recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with respect
         to the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock.

         (c) Stock Held by the Company or Purchaser. All shares of Company
Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in
a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties) that are (i)
owned by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) owned directly or indirectly by the
Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or (iii) owned directly or
indirectly by Purchaser or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, shall be
cancelled and no shares of Purchaser Common Stock or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (d) Dissenting Shares. Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
the holder of which has perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such rights as of the Effective Time
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. The Company shall give
Purchaser prompt notice upon receipt by Company of any such demands for payment
of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of
such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any
stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting
Stockholder"), and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal
or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Stockholder as may be
necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. Any payments made in
respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         1.3 Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option
granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each an
"Option," and collectively, "Options"), which is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall convert into the right to receive
cash to be paid in accordance with this Section 1.3. All Options converted to
cash pursuant to this Section 1.3 shall terminate effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
make or shall cause to be made a cash payment to the holder of each Option in an
amount (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Option multiplied by the amount by which
$31.50 exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the
Option held by such holder. Prior to receipt of such payment, each holder of an
Option shall execute a cancellation agreement, substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto ("Cancellation Agreement"). In the event a holder of an Option
has not delivered an executed Cancellation Agreement prior to the Effective
Time, such holder shall be paid by Purchaser the amount to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1.3 within five (5) business days of Purchaser's receipt of such
Cancellation Agreement.

         1.4 Consummation of the Merger; Effective Time. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be consummated (the "Closing") at the offices of Vedder, Price,
Kaufman & Kammholz, P.C., 222 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, on such
date and time as shall be fixed by mutual agreement of Purchaser and the Company
as promptly as practicable, but not later than five (5) business days (unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties or except as set forth below) after all of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than the receipt of closing
certificates and legal opinions) have first been fulfilled or waived, provided
such conditions shall continue, on such fifth business day, to be fulfilled or
waived, including the conditions which, by their terms, are to be satisfied on
the Closing Date and/or at the Effective Time; provided, further, that if the
Closing would otherwise occur pursuant to this Section 1.4 on a date during the
last month of a calendar quarter that is after the dividend payment date in that
quarter for the Company's regular quarterly dividend but before the dividend
record date in such month for Purchaser's regular quarterly dividend, Purchaser
shall have the right to delay the Closing to the next business day immediately
following Purchaser's dividend record date (the date of such closing being the
"Closing Date"). At the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall cause the
Merger to become effective by causing a certificate of merger substantially in
the form set forth in Exhibit B (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed in
accordance with the DGCL and to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware providing for the Merger to become effective at 12:01 a.m. on
the date immediately following the Closing Date, or at such other time as the
parties may mutually agree. The time at which the Merger becomes effective shall
be referred to as the "Effective Time."

         1.5 Exchange of Company Common Stock.

         (a) Surrender of Certificates. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than three (3) business days following the
Effective Time, Computershare Investor Services LLP (the "Exchange Agent"),
pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Company
consistent with the terms hereof, shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which, as of the Effective Time, represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate"): (i) a form
letter of

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or a lost certificate affidavit and bond in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent) to the Exchange Agent; and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent (or a lost certificate affidavit and bond in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent), together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, (i) a certificate evidencing the whole number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock,
theretofore represented by the Certificate so surrendered, shall have been
converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.2, plus (ii) the aggregate
amount of Per Share Cash Consideration which such holder would be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.2 plus, (iii) such additional cash amount, if any,
payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. Purchaser shall direct the
Exchange Agent to make such deliveries within three (3) business days of the
receipt of all required documentation. If any Purchaser Common Stock to be
exchanged for shares of Company Common Stock is to be delivered in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it
shall be a condition to the exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that all
signatures shall be guaranteed by a member firm of any national securities
exchange in the United States or the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., or by a commercial bank or trust company or other financial institution
acceptable to Purchaser having an office in the United States, and that the
person requesting the payment shall either (a) pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or (b) establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not
payable. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and any such shares of
Company Common Stock presented to the Exchange Agent shall be cancelled in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto as provided
in Section 1.2 above.

         (b) Failure to Exchange Company Common Stock. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Purchaser
Common Stock represented thereby nor will any payment of the Per Share
Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares be made to any holder until
the holder of record shall surrender such Certificate (or comply with the
provision with respect to lost Certificates above) and no interest will accrue
or become payable on any such amounts. Subject to the effect, if any, of
applicable law, after the subsequent surrender and exchange of a Certificate (or
comply with the provision with respect to lost Certificates above), the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or distributions,
without interest thereon, which theretofore became payable with respect to the
Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate. All dividends or other
distributions declared on or after the Effective Time with respect to the
Purchaser Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof on or after
the Effective Time which are payable to the holder of a Certificate not
theretofore surrendered and exchanged for Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 1.5(b) shall be paid or delivered by Purchaser to the Exchange
Agent, in trust, for the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

benefit of such holders and paid (without interest) upon surrender for exchange
of the Certificate (or compliance with the provision with respect to lost
Certificates above). All such dividends and distributions held by the Exchange
Agent for payment or delivery to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates
unclaimed at the end of one (1) year from the Effective Time shall be repaid or
redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser after which time any holder of
Certificates who has not theretofore surrendered such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, subject to applicable law, shall look only to Purchaser for
payment or delivery of such dividends or distributions, as the case may be. Any
shares of Purchaser Common Stock and any cash amounts or other consideration
delivered or made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
1.5(b) and not exchanged for Certificates within one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser which shall
thereafter act as exchange agent subject to the rights of holders of
unsurrendered Certificates hereunder.

         (c) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Purchaser shall relate to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or assert any rights of a stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of
any fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser shall cause to be paid
to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled
to receive a fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the
Purchaser Closing Price.

         (d) Exchange Fund. On the date the Effective Time occurs, Purchaser
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
Section 1.5, an aggregate amount of cash, sufficient to pay the aggregate Per
Share Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.2(b) (plus an additional
amount of cash sufficient to cover amounts payable in lieu of any fractional
shares of Company Common Stock) (such cash, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable as part
of the aggregate Merger Consideration, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

         (e) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
former holder of Company Common Stock for any consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable escheat or abandoned property laws.

                                      II.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that the

though made then and as though the Effective Time were substituted for the date
of this Agreement throughout this Article II), except as to any representation
or warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date, which only need be so
correct as of such earlier date. The Purchaser has made a good faith effort to
ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule
corresponds to the section

                                      -6-

referenced herein. However, for purposes of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule,
any item disclosed on any schedule therein is deemed to be fully disclosed with
respect to all schedules under which such item may be relevant as and to the
extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such schedule that such item
applies to such other schedule. The "Purchaser Disclosure Schedule" shall
consist of the agreements, lists, instruments and other documentation and
information described or referred to in this Agreement as being provided on a
specific schedule.

         2.1 Organization.

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
power and authority, corporate and otherwise, to own, operate and lease its
assets, properties and businesses, and to carry on its business substantially as
it has been and is now being conducted. Purchaser is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted by it
requires that it be so qualified, except where the failure to so qualify would
not have a material adverse effect on the business of Purchaser and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement, and, upon the approval of the Governmental
Authorities (as defined herein), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Purchaser is duly registered as a unitary savings and loan holding
company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA").

         (b) Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in

has not engaged, and will not engage prior to the Merger, in any activities
other than those necessary to effectuate the terms of this Agreement. The
authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock,
no par value per share, of which 100 shares are issued and outstanding.

                                      -7-

each of the Purchaser Corporate Subsidiaries is either wholly-owned by Purchaser

organized and validly existing corporation or limited liability company, as
applicable, in good standing under the laws of the State of Illinois, Delaware,
Vermont, Wisconsin or Nevada, as applicable, with entity power and authority to

substantially as it has been and is now being conducted. Each Purchaser
Subsidiary holds all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and rights from
all appropriate federal, state or other public authorities necessary for the
conduct of its and their respective businesses, except where the failure to so
hold does not have a material adverse effect on the business of the Purchaser
and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         2.2 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly approved and authorized by each of Purchaser's and Merger Sub's Board
of Directors, and all necessary corporate action on the part of Purchaser and
Merger Sub has been taken. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Purchaser and Merger Sub and, subject to the approval of all Governmental
Authorities, will constitute the valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and
Merger Sub, except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws or
equitable principles and doctrines. Neither the Certificate of Incorporation nor
the By-laws of the Purchaser will need to be amended to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         2.3 Conflicts. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser and Merger Sub, and the Bank Merger Agreement by Mid America do not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will
not, conflict with or result in any violation of the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of Purchaser or Merger Sub or organizational documents
of any Purchaser Subsidiary. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser and Merger Sub, and the Bank Merger Agreement by Mid America do not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will
not, conflict with or result in any violation, breach or termination of, or
default or loss of a material benefit under, or permit the acceleration of, any
obligation or result in the creation of any material lien, charge or encumbrance
on any of the property or assets under any provision of any mortgage, indenture,
lease, agreement or other instrument, permit, concession, grant, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Purchaser or Merger Sub or their respective properties, other than
any such conflicts, violations or defaults which (i) individually or in the
aggregate do not have a material adverse effect on Purchaser and the Purchaser
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) will be cured, by valid amendment or
otherwise, or waived prior to the Effective Time. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal or
state governmental authority is required by or with respect to Purchaser, Merger
Sub or Mid America in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement, or the consummation by Purchaser, Merger
Sub or Mid America of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
absence of which would have a material adverse effect upon Purchaser, except for
those relating to: any application or notice with the Office of Thrift
Supervision ("OTS"), the FDIC, and any other federal or state regulatory
authorities having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "Governmental Authorities"); the Registration Statement to be
filed by Purchaser relating to the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to this Agreement (the

                                      -8-

"SEC"), which Registration Statement shall include the proxy statement for use
in connection with the meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the "Proxy

Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; any
filings, approvals or no-action letters with or from state securities

consists of the following:

</TABLE>

All of the issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock have been,
and all of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will
be at the Effective Time, duly and validly authorized and issued, and are, or
upon issuance in the Merger will be, as the case may be, fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock has been
issued in violation of any preemptive rights and none of the outstanding shares
of Purchaser Common Stock is or will be entitled to any preemptive rights in
respect of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser has reserved, and will at the Effective Time have, a number
of authorized but unissued shares of Purchaser Common Stock or shares of
Purchaser Common Stock held in treasury sufficient to pay the stock portion of
the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.2 hereof.

         2.5 Purchaser Financial Statements; Material Changes. Purchaser has
previously delivered or made available to the Company its audited consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and
the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March
31, 2004 (collectively, the "Purchaser Financial Statements"). The Purchaser
Financial Statements (x) have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis ("GAAP") during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the
case of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, except for the absence
of footnotes and for normal and recurring year-end adjustments which are not
material); and (y) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
statement of financial condition of Purchaser as of the dates thereof and the
related consolidated statement of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for the periods then ended. Except as otherwise disclosed in the
Purchaser Reports filed with the SEC on or prior to May 9, 2004, since December
31, 2003 to the date hereof, Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, have not undergone or suffered any changes in their condition
(financial or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business or
operations which have been, in any case or in the aggregate, materially adverse
to Purchaser on a consolidated basis.

         2.6 Purchaser Reports. (a) Since January 1, 2003, each of Purchaser and
the Purchaser Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that were required to be
filed since such date with (a) the SEC, (b) the OTS, (c) the FDIC, (d) any
applicable state banking, insurance, securities, or other regulatory

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

authorities (except filings which are not material), and (e) Nasdaq
(collectively, the "Purchaser Reports"). Purchaser has previously made available
to the Company true and complete copies of the Purchaser Reports requested by
the Company. As of their respective filing dates, each of the Purchaser Reports
(after giving effect to any amendments thereto), including the financial
statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the statutes, rules, and regulations enforced
or promulgated by the authority with which they were filed. The Purchaser
Reports filed with the SEC did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

         (b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.6(b) to the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule and except for examinations or reviews conducted in the regular course
of the business of Purchaser or the Purchaser Subsidiaries by the SEC, Internal
Revenue Service, Department of Labor, state, and local taxing authorities, OTS
or the FDIC, no federal, state or local governmental agency, commission or other
entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the best knowledge of Purchaser,
investigation into the business or operations of Purchaser or the Purchaser
Subsidiaries within the past three (3) years nor, to the best of our knowledge,
has any such proceeding or investigation been threatened nor is currently
pending. None of Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary is subject to a written
agreement (as such term is defined pursuant to 12 U.S.C. ss.1818) with the OTS
or the FDIC. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception noted by
the SEC, OTS or FDIC, or other agency, commission or entity with respect to any
Purchaser Report that has had or is expected to have a material adverse effect
on the business of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         2.7 Compliance With Laws. Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries are
each in compliance with all material federal and state laws and regulations that
regulate the business of a savings bank, including, without limitation, HOLA and
the FDI Act, and Purchaser and each of the Purchaser Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations, except in each case
where the failure to comply would not have a material adverse effect on the
business of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         2.8 Litigation. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding,
legal, quasi-judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending or, to the best
knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against or affecting Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents, in their capacities as such, which, if adversely determined, would
have a material adverse effect on the business of Purchaser and the Purchaser
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would materially affect the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated herein or which is seeking
to enjoin consummation of the transactions provided for herein or to obtain
other relief in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

         2.9 Defaults. There has not been any default, or the occurrence of an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, in
any obligation to be performed by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary under
any contract, commitment, or other material obligation to which Purchaser, any
Purchaser Subsidiary or their respective properties is subject, and neither
Purchaser nor any Purchaser Subsidiary has waived any right under any contract
or

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

commitment, except in each case where any such default or waiver, singly or in
the aggregate with any other such defaults or waivers, would not have a material
adverse effect on the business of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. To the best knowledge of Purchaser, no other party to any such
material contract or commitment is in default in any material obligation to be
performed by such party.

         2.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the
Purchaser Reports filed with the SEC on or prior to May 9, 2004, since December
31, 2003, there has not been, except for the transactions as contemplated herein
or matters related thereto, any event or condition of any character which has
had or would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Purchaser.

         2.11 Undisclosed Liabilities. All of the obligations or liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due
or becoming due, and regardless of when asserted) arising out of transactions or
events heretofore entered into, or any action or inaction, including taxes with
respect to or based upon transactions or events heretofore occurring, that are
required to be reflected, disclosed or reserved against in the audited
consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP ("Liabilities") have,
in the case of Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries, been so reflected,
disclosed or reserved against in the audited consolidated financial statements
of Purchaser as of December 31, 2003 or in the notes thereto, and Purchaser and
the Purchaser Subsidiaries have no other Liabilities except Liabilities incurred
since December 31, 2003, in the ordinary course of business or in connection
with acquisitions consummated prior to December 31, 2003.

         2.12 Licenses. To Purchaser's best knowledge, Purchaser and each
Purchaser Subsidiary, respectively, hold all governmental registrations,
licenses, permits or franchises (each a "Purchaser Permit") required to be held
by it and which are material with respect to the operation of their respective
businesses, except for such Purchaser Permits which, the failure to hold, would
not have a material adverse effect on the business of Purchaser and the
Purchaser Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         2.13 Government Approvals. To Purchaser's best knowledge, no fact or
condition exists with respect to Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary which
Purchaser has reason to believe will prevent it from obtaining approval of the
Merger, the Bank Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any Governmental Authority.

         2.14 Accuracy of All Representations. The representations and
warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements contained in such representations and warranties not misleading.

         2.15 Fees. Other than the financial advisory services performed for
Purchaser by Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Incorporated, neither Purchaser nor any
of the Purchaser Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, has employed a broker or finder or incurred any liability
for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or finder's fees,
and no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for the

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         2.16 Fairness Opinion. Purchaser has received an opinion, dated the
date of this Agreement, from Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Incorporated, that,
subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth therein, the
Merger Consideration is fair to Purchaser's stockholders from a financial point
of view.

         2.17 Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by the
Purchaser for inclusion or to be incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement or the information relating to the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Subsidiaries in the Registration Statement, will, in the case of the Proxy
Statement after giving effect to any amendments thereof or supplements thereto,
at the time of the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held for purposes
of adopting the Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading or, in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes
effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading.
The portions of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement relating to the
Purchaser which are incorporated by reference to Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed
by the Purchaser under the Securities Exchange Act comply and will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act.

                                      III.

         The Company represents and warrants to Purchaser that the statements
contained in this Article III are correct and complete as of the date of this
Agreement and will be correct and complete as of the Effective Time (as though
made then and as though the Effective Time were substituted for the date of this
Agreement throughout this Article III), except as to any representation or
warranty which specifically relates to an earlier date, which only need be so
correct as of such earlier date. The Company has made a good faith effort to
ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the Company Disclosure Schedule
corresponds to the section referenced herein. However, for purposes of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, any item disclosed on any schedule therein is

Disclosure Schedule" shall consist of all of the agreements, lists, instruments
and other documentation and information described or referred to in this
Agreement as being provided on a specified schedule.

         3.1 Organization. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized,

nature of the business transacted by it

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

requires that it be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
does not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries,

herein. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement, and, upon the approval of the Governmental Authorities and

"insured depository institution" as defined in the FDI Act and applicable
regulations thereunder, the deposits of which are insured by FDIC through SAIF
to the full extent permitted under applicable laws. The Bank has all requisite
power and authority to enter into the Bank Merger Agreement and, upon the

owned or leased by it or the nature of the business transacted by it requires
that it be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified does not
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein. Each Company Subsidiary holds all licenses, certificates, permits,
franchises and rights from all appropriate federal, state or other public
authorities necessary for the conduct of its and their respective businesses,

authority is required by or with respect to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Bank Merger Agreement or the consummation by the Company or the Bank of the

application or notice with the Governmental Authorities; any application or
notice with the Illinois Department of Insurance (the "IDI") with respect to the
Company Insurance Company; the Purchaser's Registration Statement and the
Company's Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC; the filing of the

against the Company or any Company Subsidiary alleging breach of any express or
implied employment contract or commitment, or material breach of any applicable
law, order, regulation, public policy or ordinance relating to employment or
terms and conditions of employment, and, to the best knowledge of the Company,
there is no basis for any valid claim or charge with regard to such matters.

         (c) No investigation or review by any governmental entity with respect

legal, quasi-judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, in their capacities as such, which is seeking damages against the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents, in their capacities as such, in excess of $100,000, or
which would materially affect the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein or which is seeking to enjoin consummation of
the transactions provided for herein or to obtain other relief in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, having, or which
could reasonably be foreseen to have in the future, any such effect.

         3.10 Defaults. There has not been any default, or the occurrence of an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default, in
any obligation to be performed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under
any contract, commitment, or other material obligation to which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or their respective properties is subject, and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any right under any contract or
commitment, except in each case where any such default or waiver, singly or in
the aggregate with any other such defaults or waivers, would not have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. To the best knowledge of the Company, no other party to any such
material contract or commitment is in default in any material obligation to be
performed by such party.

to the operation of their respective businesses.

         3.14 Governmental and Stockholder Approvals. To the Company's best
knowledge, no fact or condition exists which the Company has reason to believe
will prevent the parties from obtaining approval of the Merger, the Bank Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental
Authority, the IDI or the stockholders of the Company.

         3.15 Antitakeover Provisions Inapplicable. Other than Section 203 of
the DGCL, no "business combination," "moratorium," "control share" or other
state antitakeover statute or regulation, nor any provision in the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, (i) prohibits or restricts the
Company's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or its
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii)
would have the effect of invalidating or voiding this Agreement, or any
provision hereof or thereof, or (iii) would subject Purchaser to any impediment

Agreement. The Company has taken all steps necessary to cause the restrictions
on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the

will be as of such subsequent financial statement dates) in the reasonable
judgment of the Company, adequate in all respects to provide for possible or
specific losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, on
loans outstanding, and based upon GAAP.

         3.22 Insurance Subsidiary.

         (a) The Company Insurance Subsidiary is duly licensed as an insurance

Schedule, the Company Insurance Subsidiary maintains E&O insurance coverage in
amounts sufficient to satisfy the requirements, if any, under its agreements
with insurance companies. In the reasonable opinion of the Company, such
insurance coverages are adequate for the business of the Company Insurance
Subsidiary, and neither the Company nor the Company Insurance Subsidiary has
received notice of any cancellation or nonrenewal of the applicable insurance
policies. Except as described on Schedule 3.22(c) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no material claims pending or threatened against the Company
Insurance Subsidiary for any act, error or omission in services rendered by any
agent or employee of the Company Insurance Subsidiary or that should have been

duty or obligation in any material respect.

         (d) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.22(d) of the Company's Disclosure
Schedules, there are no continuing rights or unperformed obligations of the
Company Insurance Subsidiary with respect to prior acquisitions of any business
or substantially all of the properties, assets or securities of any business.
Schedule 3.22(d) contains true and correct copies of such continuing agreements,
including any employment, non-competition or indemnification agreements, and a
schedule of purchase price amounts, contingent or otherwise, if any, remaining

         3.23 Company Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 3.23(a)(i) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a list and a true and correct copy (or, a
description with respect to any oral employee benefit plan, practice, policy or
arrangement), including all amendments thereto, of each compensation,
consulting, employment, termination or collective bargaining agreement, and each

retention, life, health, accident or other insurance, bonus, deferred or
incentive compensation, severance or separation agreement or any agreement
providing any payment or benefit resulting from a change in control, profit
sharing, retirement, or other employee benefit plan, practice, policy or
arrangement of any kind, oral or written, covering employees, former employees,
directors or former directors of the Company or each Company Subsidiary or their
respective beneficiaries, including, but not limited to, any employee benefit
plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary maintains, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
contributes, or under which any employee, former employee, director or former
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is covered or has benefit
rights and pursuant to which any liability of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary exists or is reasonably likely to occur (the "Company Benefit
Plans"), and current summary plan descriptions, trust agreements, and insurance
contracts and Internal Revenue Service Form 5500

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

or 5500-C/R (for the three most recently completed plan years) with respect
thereto, and the loan agreement and related documents, including any amendments
thereto, evidencing the ESOP Loan (as described in Section 3.23(h)(iv) below).
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company neither maintains nor has entered into any Company Benefit Plan or
other document, plan or agreement which contains any change in control
provisions which would cause an increase or acceleration of benefits or benefit
entitlements to employees or former employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or their respective beneficiaries, or other provisions, which would
cause an increase in the liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
to Purchaser as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any related action thereafter (a "Change in Control Benefit"). The term "Company
Benefit Plans" as used herein refers to all plans contemplated under the
preceding sentences of this Section 3.23, provided that the term "Plan" or
"Plans" is used in this Agreement for convenience only and does not constitute
an acknowledgment that a particular arrangement is an employee benefit plan
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been notified by any Governmental
Authority to modify or limit any payments or other compensation paid or payable
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under this Agreement, any Company
Benefit Plan or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any employee or director of
Company or any Company Subsidiary and to the best knowledge of the Company, all
such payments are in compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and
bulletins promulgated by the Governmental Authorities.

         (b) Each of the Company Benefit Plans that is intended to be a pension,
profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, savings or employee stock ownership plan
that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("Company Qualified Plans")
has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code and an application for determination of such qualification
has been timely made to the Internal Revenue Service prior to the end of the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code (a copy of
each such determination letter and each pending application is included on
Schedule 3.23(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and, to the best knowledge
of the Company, there exist no circumstances likely to materially adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Company Qualified Plan. All such Company
Qualified Plans established or maintained by the Company or each Company
Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary contribute are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA,
and are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable requirements
(including qualification and non-discrimination requirements in effect as of the
Effective Time) of the Code for obtaining the tax benefits the Code thereupon
permits with respect to such Company Qualified Plans. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.23(b), no Company Qualified Plan is a defined benefit pension plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA. All accrued contributions and other
payments required to be made by the Company or each Company Subsidiary to any
Company Benefit Plan through the date hereof, have been made or reserves
adequate for such purposes as of the date hereof, have been set aside therefor
and reflected in the Company Financial Statements. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has accumulated any funding deficiency under Section 412 of
the Code. For each Company Qualified Plan that is a defined benefit pension
plan, the net fair market value of assets under the Plan exceeds the actuarial
present value of the accumulated Plan benefits, both vested and non-vested, as
determined on the basis of the actuarial methods and assumptions used for

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

purposes of the most recent actuarial report for the Plan filed with the
Internal Revenue Service. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
material default in performing any of its respective contractual obligations
under any of the Company Benefit Plans or any related trust agreement or
insurance contract, and there are no material outstanding liabilities of any
such Plan other than liabilities for benefits to be paid to participants in such
Plan and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of such Plan.

         (c) There is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened litigation or pending claim (other than individual benefit claims
made in the ordinary course) by or on behalf of or against any of the Company
Benefit Plans (or with respect to the administration of any of such Plans) now
or heretofore maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary which allege
violations of applicable state or federal law or the terms of the Plan which are
reasonably likely to result in a liability on the part of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any such Plan.

         (d) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and all other persons
having fiduciary or other responsibilities or duties with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan are, and since the inception of each such Plan have been, in
substantial compliance with, and each such Plan is and has been operated in
substantial accordance with, its provisions and in substantial compliance with
the applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such Plan, including,
without limitation, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") and the Internal
Revenue Service under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. No
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) has occurred with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan has engaged in or been
a party to a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975(c) of the Code) without an exemption thereto under Section 408 of
ERISA or Section 4975(d) of the Code. All Company Benefit Plans that are group
health plans have been operated in compliance with the group health plan
continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-609 of
ERISA and with the certification of prior coverage and other requirements of
Sections 701-702 and 711-713 of ERISA.

         (e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred, nor to
the best knowledge of the Company or such Company Subsidiary is reasonably
likely to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any
Plan subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA now or heretofore maintained
or contributed to by it or by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

         (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23(f) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any payments,
or is or has been a party to any agreement or any Company Benefit Plan, that
under any circumstances could obligate it, or any Company Subsidiary, or any
successor of any of them, to make any payment that is not or will not be
deductible in full because of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.

         (g) Schedule 3.23(g) to the Company Disclosure Schedule describes any
obligation that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has to provide health or
welfare

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

benefits to retirees or other former employees, directors or their dependents
(other than rights under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA),

directors and dependents entitled to such coverages and their ages.

material to the financial condition of the Company on a consolidated basis.

         (j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
bound by any collective bargaining agreement and, to the best of the Company's
knowledge, no labor union claims to or is seeking to represent any employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

         (c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary are in compliance in all
material respects with all federal, state and local laws relating to pollution
or protection of the environment such as laws relating to emissions, discharges,
releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Materials or otherwise relating to

         3.25 Material Contracts. Schedule 3.25 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each contract, indenture, and other binding commitment and
agreement (including any wholesale broker or loan purchase agreement, but not
including documents evidencing, governing or related to loans or credits by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or deposits or investments held by the Bank)
that provides for the receipt or expenditure of in excess of $50,000 over the
course of any twelve-month period, or which cannot be terminated without penalty
in excess of $25,000 to which the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or to which the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
properties are subject (collectively, the "Material Contracts" and each a
"Material Contract"). True copies of each Material Contract are set forth on
Schedule 3.25 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, including all material
amendments and supplements thereto. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.25 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the Material Contracts are binding upon the
Company and/or Company Subsidiaries (as applicable) and, to the Company's best
knowledge, the other parties thereto. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have each duly performed in all material respects all of its obligations under
each Material Contract to which they are a party to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued. No breach or default under any Material
Contract by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Company's
knowledge, any other party thereto, has occurred which has had or which would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.25, none of the Material Contracts contains an express prohibition
against assignment by operation of law or a change of control of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary (or require written consent or notice to the other party),
or contains any other provision which would preclude Purchaser from exercising
and enjoying all of the rights, remedies and obligations of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, under such Material Contracts.

         3.26 Real Property. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.26(a) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company Subsidiary have good,
sufficient and marketable title to their real properties, including any
leaseholds and ground leases, and their other assets and properties, all as
reflected as owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Company
Financial Statements dated as of March 31, 2004 except for (i) assets and
properties disposed of since such date in the ordinary course of business and
(ii) such liens as set forth on Schedule 3.26(a) to the Company Disclosure
Schedule. All buildings, structures, fixtures and appurtenances comprising part
of the real properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether owned
or leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary) are in good operating
condition and have been well maintained, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
Title to all real property listed as being owned by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary on the Company Disclosure Schedule is held in fee simple. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary have title or other rights to its assets sufficient
in all material respects for the conduct of their respective businesses as
presently conducted, and such assets are free, clear and discharged of, and from
any and all liens, charges, encumbrances, security interests and/or equities.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         (b) All leases pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
as lessee, leases real or personal property are, to the best knowledge of the
Company, valid, effective, and enforceable against the lessor in accordance with
their respective terms. There is not under any of such leases any existing
default, or any event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default, with respect to either the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or to the best knowledge of the Company, the other party. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.26(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of such
leases contains a prohibition against assignment by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, by operation of law or otherwise, or any other provision which would
preclude the Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary from possessing and using the
leased premises for the same purposes and upon the same rental and other terms
upon the consummation of the Merger as are applicable to the possession and use
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made a prior assignment for
collateral purposes of any such lease.

         3.27 Indemnification. To the best knowledge of the Company, no action
or failure to take action by any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company or each Company Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise to a claim
or a potential claim by any such person for indemnification from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under the corporate indemnification provisions of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect on the date of this Agreement.

         3.28 Insider Interests. All outstanding loans and other contractual
arrangements (including deposit relationships) between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any officer, director or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary conform to the applicable rules and regulations and
requirements of all applicable regulatory agencies which were in effect when
such loans and other contractual arrangements were entered into. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.28 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, no officer, director
or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material interest
in any property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in or pertaining
to the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

         3.29 Accuracy of All Representations. The representations and
warranties made by the Company in this Agreement do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements contained in such representations and warranties not misleading.

         3.30 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the Company has
received an opinion, dated the date of this Agreement, from Keefe, Bruyette &
Woods, Inc., that, subject to the terms, conditions and qualifications set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration is fair to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view.

         3.31 Fees. Other than the financial advisory services performed for the
Company by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., neither the Company, nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents, has employed a broker or finder or incurred any liability for any
financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or finder's

                                      -28-

fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for the Company
or any Company Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                                      IV.

any of them in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action

the extent that the Company shall otherwise consent in writing, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) that:

         (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and the
Purchaser Subsidiaries will maintain their respective books in accordance with
GAAP, conduct their respective businesses and operations only in accordance with
safe and sound banking and business practices and will use best efforts to
comply in all material respects with all applicable federal and state laws, and,
to the extent consistent with such businesses, use all reasonable

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

efforts to preserve intact their present business organizations, to generally
keep available the services of their present officers and employees and to
preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers and others having
business dealings with them to the end that their respective goodwill and going
businesses shall be unimpaired at the Effective Time.

         (b) Purchaser will, and will cause the Purchaser Subsidiaries to, use
their best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with the Company in obtaining)
any consent, authorization or approval of, or any exemption by, any governmental
authority or agency, or other third party, required to be obtained or made by
any of them in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that if Purchaser shall reasonably
determine that acceptance of nonstandard conditions or restrictions would have a
materially adverse effect on Purchaser, Purchaser shall have no further
obligations under this Section 4.2(b). Purchaser will not, nor will it permit
any of the Purchaser Subsidiaries to, knowingly or willfully take any action
that would adversely affect their ability to perform their obligations under
this Agreement.

         (c) The Purchaser agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such other national

of issuance, the shares of the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger.

         4.3 Certain Actions. (a) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or their directors, officers or employees (i) shall solicit, initiate,
participate in discussions of, or encourage or take any other action to
facilitate (including by way of the disclosing or furnishing of any information
that it is not legally obligated to disclose or furnish) any inquiry or the
making of any proposal relating to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below)
or a potential Acquisition Transaction with respect to the Company or, except at
the request of Purchaser, any Company Subsidiary, or (ii) shall enter into any
agreement, arrangement, or understanding (whether written or oral), regarding
any proposal or transaction providing for or requiring it to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate this Agreement, or compensating it or any Company
Subsidiary under any of the instances described in this clause, provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations or an agreement with any person or entity that makes
an unsolicited written proposal after the date hereof to acquire the Company
pursuant to an Acquisition Transaction (an "Acquisition Proposal"), if, and only
to the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company has consulted with
its independent financial advisor as to whether such Acquisition Proposal may be
or could be superior to the Merger from a financial point-of-view to the
Company's shareholders, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with and after considering the advice of independent legal counsel,
determines in good faith that the failure to furnish information to or enter
into discussions with such person may cause the Board of Directors of the
Company to breach its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law; (C)
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the Company after the date hereof
and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company
(such proposal that satisfies (A), (B) and (C) being referred to herein as a
"Superior Proposal"); (D) the Company promptly notifies Purchaser of such
inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with
the Company or any of its representatives indicating, in connection with such
notice, the name of such person and the

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

material terms and conditions of any inquiries, Acquisition Proposals or offers,
and receives from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement in
form and substance identical in all material respects to the confidentiality
agreement that the Company and Purchaser entered into; and (E) the Stockholders'
Meeting has not occurred. The Company shall immediately instruct and otherwise
use its best efforts to cause its agents, advisors (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), consultants and other representatives to
comply with such prohibitions. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to such activities.

         (b) "Acquisition Transaction" shall, with respect to the Company, mean
any of the following if initiated by a party not affiliated with Purchaser: (i)
a merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction (other than the Merger) of
any company with either the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) a purchase,
lease or other acquisition of all or substantially all the assets of either the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; (iii) a purchase or other acquisition of
"beneficial ownership" by any "person" or "group" (as such terms are defined in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act) (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) which would cause such person or
group to become the beneficial owner of securities representing 10% or more of
the voting power of either the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (iv) a tender
or exchange offer to acquire securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of the Company; (v) a public proxy or consent solicitation made to
stockholders of the Company seeking proxies in opposition to any proposal
relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that has been
recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company; (vi) the filing of an
application or notice with the OTS or any other federal or state regulatory
authority seeking approval to engage in one or more of the transactions
referenced in clauses (i) through (iv) above; or (vii) the making of a bona fide
proposal to the Company or its stockholders, by public announcement or written
communication, that is or becomes the subject of public disclosure, to engage in
one or more of the transactions referenced in clauses (i) through (v) above.

                                       V.

afford to Purchaser and Purchaser's accountants, counsel and other
representatives, upon reasonable notice, full access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties,

auditors' requests for information and accountants' work papers, developed by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their accountants or attorneys, and
will permit the Company's representatives to discuss such information directly
with Purchaser's officers, directors, employees, attorneys and accountants. From
the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, upon reasonable
request, provide Purchaser with (i) a complete list of all of its stockholders

         (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, each party shall
upon request of the other party return all nonpublic documents furnished to it
hereunder or destroy all documents or portions thereof that contain nonpublic
information furnished by the other party pursuant hereto and, in any event,
shall hold all nonpublic information received pursuant hereto in the same degree
of confidence with which it maintains its own like information unless or until
such information is or becomes a matter of public knowledge or is or becomes
known to the party receiving the information through persons other than the
party providing such information.

and (ii) all meetings of the committees of each such Board of Directors,
including without limitation the audit and executive committees thereof. The
Company shall give reasonable notice to Purchaser of any such meeting. The
Company shall provide to Purchaser all information provided to the directors on
all such Boards of Directors and committees in connection with all such meetings
of directors, when the same are provided to such directors, including minutes of
prior meetings, financial reports and any other analyses prepared by senior
management of the Company. All such information provided to Purchaser shall be
treated in confidence as provided in Section 5.1(b) hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to permit Purchaser (or its
representatives) to review material containing any confidential discussion of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter
where the Company's Board of Directors has reasonably determined such review
would result in a violation of applicable Delaware law.

         5.3 Bank Merger. The Company and Purchaser intend to take all action

omissions covered thereunder and occurring on or prior to the Effective Date;
provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to pay a premium amount

Policy and the current premium amount paid by the Company to obtain such
insurance.

together, the "Indemnifying Parties") jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, or trustee

                                      -36-

unaffiliated corporate trustees (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters involving the Company, and/or any Company
Subsidiary existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent to which the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary
is permitted or required by law or their respective Certificate of Incorporation
(or other chartering document) and Bylaws to indemnify such Indemnified Parties
and in the manner to which it could indemnify such parties under the Certificate
of Incorporation (or other chartering document) and Bylaws of such entity, in
each case as in effect on the date hereof, or under applicable law.

         (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 5.4(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the appropriate Indemnifying Party thereof.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4(b), in the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to promptly and timely assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying
Party elects not to, or fails to promptly and timely assume such defense, or to
appropriately defend such claim once assumed (except with respect to any
settlement contemplated below), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which
is reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser to handle such defense and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses to all such
counsel for an Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction for an Indemnified Party), and notwithstanding any assumption of
such defense by the Indemnifying Party, an Indemnified Party may retain counsel
of its own choosing to monitor such defense (with the Indemnified Party assuming
any and all expenses as a result of hiring such counsel); (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written

Purchaser on the date hereof a signed representation letter as to certain
restrictions on resale substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto from each

Company who may reasonably be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the
meaning of such term as used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and shall
obtain and deliver to Purchaser a signed representation letter substantially in
the form of Exhibit D from any person who becomes an executive officer or
director of the Company or any stockholder who becomes such an "affiliate" after

person achieves such status. The letter described in this Section 5.5 shall
include certain provisions pursuant to which such individuals will agree to vote

conditions or restrictions with respect to the aforesaid approvals of
Governmental Authorities if it shall reasonably determine that such conditions

inquiries received concerning said application or notice. The Company shall
deliver a draft of such application or notice to Purchaser prior to filing and

in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Effective Time, or any of its obligations
set forth in this Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the
Effective Time not to be performed in all material respects at or prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation, any event, condition, change or
occurrence which individually, or in the aggregate with any other events,
conditions or changes that have occurred after the date hereof, has resulted or
which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is
reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on it. After receipt of
any such notice disclosing a material breach, the nondisclosing party may,
within five business days thereof, notify the disclosing party of its intent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d); provided, however, that the
disclosing party shall have the right to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days thereof but no later than the Effective Time. In the event the
nondisclosing party fails to notify the disclosing party of its intent to
terminate within five (5) business days after receipt of any notice hereunder,
the nondisclosing party shall be deemed to have waived its right of termination
as to any such breach arising out of or with respect to the events, conditions,
change or occurrence described in such notice; provided, however, that any
particular breach that is deemed to have been waived by the nondisclosing party
may thereafter be considered by the nondisclosing party in determining

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

the aggregate contribution of all events, conditions, changes and occurrences
described by the disclosing party pursuant to this Section 5.9 toward the
occurrence of a material breach by the disclosing party.

         5.10 Press Releases. Purchaser and the Company shall coordinate all
publicity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
except as otherwise required by law, or with respect to employee meetings,
neither party shall issue any press release, publicity statement or other public
notice relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Company shall obtain the prior consent of Purchaser
to the content of any communication to its stockholders, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         5.11 Delivery of Supplements to Disclosure Schedules. Five (5) business
days prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Purchaser will supplement or
amend their respective Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter
arising which, if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in the
Disclosure Schedule or in any representation and warranty made by the Company
which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. For purposes of determining the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Purchaser continued in Article
II hereof, or of the Company contained in Article III hereof and in order to
determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof as of
the Effective Time, the Company or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to include only the information contained therein on the date hereof and any
information previously disclosed pursuant to Section 5.9 as to which a party is
deemed to have waived its right of termination; provided, however, that delivery
of such supplements containing information which causes any representation or
warranty of either the Company or Purchaser to be false or materially misleading
will not cure any breach hereunder of such representations or warranties.

         5.12 Tax Opinion. Purchaser shall obtain a written opinion ("Tax
Opinion") of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, P.C. addressed to Purchaser,
dated the Closing Date, subject to customary representations and assumptions
referred to therein, and substantially to the effect that (a) the exchange in
the Merger of Purchaser Common Stock for Company Common Stock will not give rise
to the recognition of any income, gain or loss to Purchaser or the Company; (b)
the adjusted tax basis of the assets of the Company in the hands of Purchaser
will be the same as the adjusted tax basis of such assets in the hands of the
Company immediately prior to the exchange; and (c) the holding period of the
assets of the Company transferred to Purchaser will include the period during
which such assets were held by the Company prior to the exchange.

         5.13 Resolution of Company Benefit Plans. The Company and Purchaser
shall cooperate in effecting the following treatment of the Company Benefit
Plans, except as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company prior to the
Effective Time:

         (a) At the Effective Time, Purchaser (or a Purchaser Subsidiary) shall
be substituted for the Company or the Bank as the sponsoring employer under
those Company Benefit Plans with respect to which the Company or the Bank is a
sponsoring employer

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall assume and be vested with all
of the powers, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities previously vested in
the Company or the Bank with respect to each such plan. Except as otherwise
provided herein, each such plan and any Company Benefit Plan sponsored by the
Company or the Bank shall be continued in effect by Purchaser or any applicable
Purchaser Subsidiary after the Effective Time without a termination or
discontinuance thereof as a result of the Merger, subject to the power reserved
to Purchaser or any applicable Purchaser Subsidiary under each such plan to
subsequently amend or terminate the plan, which amendments or terminations shall
comply with applicable law. The Company, the Bank and Purchaser will use all
reasonable efforts (i) to effect said substitutions and assumptions, and take
such other actions contemplated under this Agreement, and (ii) to amend such
plans as to the extent necessary to provide for said substitutions and
assumptions, and such other actions contemplated under this Agreement.

         (b) Except as contemplated in the Letter of Understanding or Benefits
Letter discussed below, at or as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, as Purchaser shall reasonably determine, Purchaser shall provide, or cause
any Purchaser Subsidiary to provide, to each employee of the Company and the
Bank as of the Effective Time ("Company Employees") the opportunity to
participate in each employee benefit plan and program maintained by Purchaser or
the Purchaser Subsidiaries for similarly situated employees (the "Purchaser
Benefit Plans"); provided, however, that with respect to such Purchaser Benefit
Plans, Company Employees shall be given credit for service with the Company or
the Bank in determining eligibility for and vesting in benefits thereunder, but
not for purposes of benefit accrual except that such prior service shall be
recognized for benefit accrual purposes under any vacation pay plan or program
and under any severance compensation plan or program; provided, further, that
Company Employees shall not be subject to any waiting periods or pre-existing
condition exclusions under the Purchaser Benefit Plans if they have satisfied
such waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions under the Company
Benefit Plan even if such periods are longer or restrictions impose a greater
limitation than the periods or limitations imposed under the Company Benefit
Plans; provided, further, that to the extent that the initial period of coverage
for Company Employees under any Purchaser Benefit Plan that is an "employee
welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a full 12-month
period of coverage, Company Employees shall be given credit under the applicable
Purchaser Benefit Plans for any deductibles and co-insurance payments made by
such Company Employees under the Company Benefit Plans during the balance of
such 12-month period of coverage. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall
obligate Purchaser to provide or cause to be provided any benefits duplicative
of those provided under any Company Benefit Plan continued pursuant to
subparagraph (a) above, including, but not limited to, extending participation
in any Purchaser Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" under
ERISA with respect to any year during which allocations are made to Company
Employees under the Company ESOP or profit sharing plan. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the power of Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary
to amend or terminate any benefit plan or program, including any Company Benefit
Plan, shall not be altered or affected. Moreover, neither this Agreement nor the
Letter of Understanding discussed below shall confer upon any Company Employee
any rights or remedies hereunder and shall not constitute a contract of
employment or create the rights, to be retained or otherwise, in employment with
Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary.

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

         (c) Concurrently with or immediately after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain from the President
of the Company who is a party to an employment agreement with the Bank a Letter
of Understanding with Purchaser substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached
hereto (the "Letter of Understanding"), addressing certain matters pertaining to
such executive's employment agreement and benefits payable thereunder, and
participation in other Company Benefit Plans.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all
retention, severance, covenant not to compete, termination payments,
acceleration of benefit vesting, and other compensation paid by the Company or
the Bank, or as provided for in this Agreement, the Letter of Understanding,
Exhibit F, any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, including, but not limited to,
any Change in Control Benefit, shall not violate any prohibitions which are
imposed by any Governmental Authorities, or which any Governmental Authorities
otherwise deem to constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices or
unreasonable compensation giving effect to any obligations of Purchaser or the
Purchaser Subsidiary as provided herein or in the Letter of Understanding.

         (e) Purchaser and the Company agree to take certain actions to
effectuate the foregoing and other actions with respect to the Company Benefit
Plans as set forth in the letter agreement of even date herewith between
Purchaser and the Company in the form of Exhibit F attached hereto (the
"Benefits Letter").

         5.14 Environmental Investigation.

         (a) Purchaser shall engage an environmental consultant to conduct a
preliminary ("Phase I") environmental assessment of each of the parcels of owned
real estate used in the operation of the businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and any other real estate owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any Tax Subsidiary. The fees and expenses of the
consultant with respect to the Phase I assessments shall be paid by Purchaser.
The Company shall fully cooperate with Purchaser to provide the consultant
reasonable access to the premises under assessment. The consultant shall
complete and deliver the Phase I assessments not later than sixty (60) days
after the date of this Agreement. If any environmental conditions are found or
suspected or would tend to be indicated by the report of the consultant which
may be contrary to the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
herein without regard to any exceptions that may be contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser shall cause copies of the consultant reports to
be furnished to the Company, and the parties shall then obtain from one or more
mutually acceptable consultants or contractors, as appropriate, an estimate of
the cost of any further environmental investigation, sampling, analysis,
remediation, or other follow-up work that may be necessary to address those
conditions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

         (b) Upon receipt of the estimate of the costs of all follow-up work to
the Phase I assessments or any subsequent investigation phases that may be
conducted, the parties shall attempt to agree upon a course of action for
further investigation and remediation of any environmental condition suspected,
found to exist, or that would tend to be indicated by the report of the
consultant. All post-Phase I investigations or assessments (the cost of which
shall be paid by Purchaser), all work plans for any post-Phase I assessments or
remediation and any

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

removal or remediation actions that may be performed shall be mutually
satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company. If the work plans or removal or
remediation actions are estimated to cost more than $100,000 (individually or in
the aggregate) to complete, Purchaser and the Company shall discuss a mutually
acceptable modification of this Agreement. Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate in the review, approval and implementation of all work plans.

         (c) If the parties are unable to agree upon a course of action for
further investigation and remediation of an environmental condition or issue
raised by an environmental assessment and/or a mutually acceptable modification
to this Agreement, and the condition or issue is not one for which it can be
determined to a reasonable degree of certainty that the risk and expense to
which the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, Mid America or any affiliate would
be subject as owner of the property involved can be quantified, in good faith,
and limited to an amount less than $500,000 then Purchaser may abandon this
Agreement as soon as possible but in no event more than 120 days after the
receipt of the Phase I assessments.

         5.15 Title to Real Estate. As soon as practical after the date hereof,
but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, the
Company, at its own expense, shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser, with respect
to all real estate owned or held pursuant to a ground lease by the Company, or
any Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, either (i) an owner's preliminary
report of title covering a date subsequent to the date hereof, issued by Chicago
Title Insurance Company or such other title insurance company accepted by
Purchaser (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld), showing fee simple
title in the Company or such Company Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, in such real
estate or the appropriate leasehold interest of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary or Tax Subsidiary, subject only to (A) the standard exceptions to
title customarily contained in a policy on ALTA 1970 Owner's Form B; (B) liens
of current state and local property taxes which are not delinquent or subject to
penalty; and (C) liens and encumbrances as disclosed on Schedule 3.26(a) to the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and restrictions and conditions of record that do
not materially adversely affect the value or use of such real estate, or (ii) a
commitment by the title insurance company currently insuring Company or Company
Subsidiary's or Tax Subsidiary's title to the real estate owned or held pursuant
to a ground lease to provide an endorsement to the current title policies
changing the name of the insured to Purchaser at Closing; provided, however, (a)
such commitments and title policies are subject only to the matters set forth in
this Section 5.15; and (b) the effective date of such endorsement shall be
subsequent to or contemporaneous with the Effective Time.

         5.16 Other Actions; Further Assurances; Form of Transaction.

         (a) At Purchaser's request, the parties will use all reasonable efforts
and cooperate in all reasonable respects with each other to obtain any consents
or waivers from third parties under any contract or agreement to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party in order to prevent any breach or
default from arising thereunder as a result of the consummation of the Merger or
the Bank Merger.

         (b) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the contemplated purposes and intent of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement
shall take all such necessary action.

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

         (c) If necessary to expedite the Closing of the Merger, the Bank Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties agree that
each will take or perform any additional reasonably necessary or advisable steps
to restructure the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that any
such restructuring will not result in any change in the Merger Consideration, or
result in any adverse consequences to the Purchaser, the Company or the
stockholders of the Company, and will not jeopardize the receipt of approvals
required from Governmental Authorities or other consents and approvals relating
to the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger or otherwise cause any
condition to Closing set forth in Article VI not to be capable of being
fulfilled.

                                      VI.

                                   CONDITIONS

other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of Purchaser to consummate
the Merger are subject to the following conditions precedent:

         (a) All of the representations and warranties made by the Company in
this Agreement and in any documents or certificates provided by the Company (i)
shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) shall have been true and correct as of the Effective Time as
though made at and as of the Effective Time, provided, however, that if any
representation or warranty (other than the representations contained in Sections
3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a), 3.4(b) and 3.4(d) is not true or correct as of the
Effective Time, the condition in this clause (ii) shall nonetheless be deemed

<PAGE>

facts or circumstances causing any representation or warranty not to be true or

government or governmental agency or instrumentality or court, which would
prohibit Purchaser's ownership or operation of all or a material portion of the
Company's business or assets, whether immediately at the Effective Time or as of

Purchaser to dispose of or hold separate all or a material portion of the
Company's business or assets, whether immediately at the Effective Time or as of

Agreement, or which would render Purchaser or the Company unable to consummate

Subsidiary, as the case may be, is a party requires the consent of, waiver from,

the Company. No action, suit, proceeding or claim shall have been instituted,

reasonable opinion of Purchaser.

Time as though made at and as of the Effective Time, provided, however, that if
any representation or warranty (other than the representations contained in
Sections 2.1(a), 2.1(b), 2.1(c), 2.2 and 2.3) is not true or correct as of the
Effective Time, the condition in this clause (ii) shall nonetheless be deemed
satisfied unless the facts or circumstances causing any representation or
warranty not to be true or correct, either individually or in the aggregate, and

representation or warranty, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser.

         (b) Purchaser shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and shall have complied in all material respects with all agreements
and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
prior to or at the Effective Time.

         (c) The Company shall have received a certificate signed by the

the Effective Time:

         (a) By mutual written consent of the Board of Directors of Purchaser
and the Board of Directors of the Company;

         (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Purchaser or the
Company if there shall have been a final judicial or regulatory determination
(as to which all periods for appeal shall have expired and no appeal shall be
pending) that any material provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable (unless the enforcement thereof is waived by the affected party)
or denying any regulatory approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the approval of which is a condition precedent to either party's
obligations hereunder;

         (c) By either party at any time after the stockholders of the Company
fail to approve this Agreement and the Merger in a vote taken at a meeting duly
convened for that purpose; provided, however, the Company shall have no right to
terminate pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the Company has taken any action,
or failed to take any action, as applicable, described in Section 7.1(g).

         (d) By Purchaser or the Company in the event of the material breach by
the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein or in any schedule or document delivered pursuant hereto, which breach
would result in the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Section 6.2 hereof, in the case of Purchaser, or Section 6.3 hereof, in the case
of the Company, except in each case, for any such breach which has been
disclosed pursuant to Section 5.9 and waived by the non-disclosing party
pursuant to Section 5.9 or cured by the disclosing party prior to the Effective
Time and within the time period specified in Section 5.9;

         (e) By either party on or after March 31, 2005, in the event the Merger

relating to certain environmental matters;

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

         (g) By the Board of Directors of Purchaser if the Company has received
a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the Company has entered into
an acquisition agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, terminated this
Agreement, or withdraws, modifies or amends in any respect adverse to Purchaser
its approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
withdraws or fails to make a unanimous recommendation that stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the Merger, or modifies or qualifies such
recommendation in a manner adverse to Purchaser, or the Board of Directors of
the Company has resolved to do any of the foregoing; or

         (h) By the Board of Directors of the Company if the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, and in accordance with Section 4.3 of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has made a determination to
accept such Superior Proposal; provided that the Company shall not terminate

agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal until the expiration of five (5)
business days following Purchaser's receipt of written notice advising Purchaser
that the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and including a copy thereof with all
accompanying documentation, if in writing) identifying the person making the
Superior Proposal and stating whether the Company intends to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal. After providing such
notice, the Company shall provide a reasonable opportunity to Purchaser during

adjusted terms.

         7.2 Termination Fee. (a) In consideration of the expenses and forgone
opportunities of Purchaser, as a condition and inducement to Purchaser's
willingness to enter into and perform this Agreement, provided that the Company

Company shall pay to Purchaser immediately upon demand a fee of $6,250,000 (the
"Termination Fee") upon the earliest to occur of the following:

                  (i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
         7.1(g), or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
         7.1(h); or

                  (ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by the Company
         relating to an Acquisition Transaction, or the consummation or
         occurrence of an Acquisition Transaction involving the Company within
         eighteen (18) months after the occurrence of any of the following: (i)
         the valid termination of the Agreement by the Purchaser pursuant to
         Section 7.1(d) because of a willful breach by the Company; or (ii) the
         failure of the stockholders of the Company to approve this Agreement
         after the occurrence of an Acquisition Proposal.

         (b) If demand for payment of the Termination Fee is made pursuant to
Section 7.2 and payment is timely made, then Purchaser will not have any other
rights or claims against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and their
respective officers and directors, with respect to this Agreement, it being
agreed that the acceptance of the Termination Fee under Section 7.2 will
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser against the Company, the

         7.3 Expenses. Except as provided elsewhere herein, Purchaser and the
Company shall each bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its
behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
fees and expenses of its own financial or other consultants, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel. In the event one of the parties hereto files suit to
enforce this Section 7.3 or a suit seeking to recover costs and expenses or
damages for a willful breach of this Agreement, the costs, fees, charges and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) of the prevailing party in
such litigation (and any related litigation) shall be borne by the losing party.

         7.4 Survival of Agreements. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Purchaser or the Company as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that (i) the
agreements contained in Sections 5.1(b), 5.10, 7.2 and 7.3 hereof shall survive
the termination hereof; and (ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) hereof
shall not relieve a breaching party from any liability for any breach giving
rise to such termination.

         7.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors at any time before or after
approval hereof by the stockholders of the Company but, after such approval, no
amendment shall be made which changes the form of consideration or adversely
affects or decreases the value of the consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders or
which in any other way adversely affects the rights of the stockholders of the
Company without the further required approval of the stockholders so affected.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. Purchaser and the Company may, without
approval of their respective Boards of Directors, make such technical changes to
this Agreement, not inconsistent with the purposes hereof and thereof, as may be
required to effect or facilitate any governmental approval or acceptance of the
Merger or of this Agreement or to effect or facilitate any filing or recording
required for the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         7.6 Waiver. Any term, provision or condition of this Agreement (other
than requirements for stockholder approval and required approvals of the
Governmental Authorities) may be waived in writing at any time by the party
which is entitled to the benefits hereof. Each and every right granted to any
party hereunder, or under any other document delivered in connection herewith or
therewith, and each and every right allowed it by law or equity, shall be
cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. The failure of either party
at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no
manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same except as
provided in Section 5.9. No waiver by any party of a condition or of the breach
of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement. No investigation, review
or audit by Purchaser of the Company or the Company of Purchaser prior to or
after the date hereof shall estop or prevent either party from exercising any
right hereunder or be deemed to be a waiver of any such right.

         8.3 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted
in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of
the State of Delaware with respect to matters of corporate laws and, with
respect to all other matters, by the laws of the State of Illinois, except to
the extent that the federal laws of the United States apply.

         8.4 Headings, Etc. The article headings and section headings contained
in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

         8.5 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a final and unappealable order of a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions contained in this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated unless the effect would be to cause this
Agreement to not achieve its essential purposes.

         8.6 Entire Agreement; Binding Effect; Nonassignment; Counterparts.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all other prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to
the subject matter hereof; and (b) is not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder except as specifically provided herein
(including without limitation Section 5.4). This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective
successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement.

         8.7 Certain Definitions. (a) Solely for purposes of Sections 2.10,
3.11, 6.2(a), 6.2(f) and 6.3(a) of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, any
effect that (a) is material and adverse to the business, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, respectively, or (b) materially impairs the ability of Purchaser or
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact
of (i) actions contemplated by this Agreement, including, with respect to the
Company, the payment of or provision for benefits contemplated to be paid to any
directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) changes in laws and
regulations or interpretations thereof that are generally applicable to banks,
savings institutions or their holding companies, (iii) changes in GAAP that are
generally applicable to banks, savings institutions or their holding companies,
(iv) expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (v) changes attributable to or resulting from changes
in general economic conditions affecting similarly situated banks, savings
institutions or their holding companies generally, including changes in the
prevailing level of interest rates.

         (b) The term "knowledge" as used with respect to a Person (including
references to such Person being aware of a particular matter) means those facts
that are known or should have been known by any of the executive officers or
directors of such Person (including with respect to the Company, John L.
Garlanger), and includes any facts, matters or circumstances set forth in any
written notice from any governmental entity or any other material written notice
received by that Person.

         (c) The term "business day" means any day that the New York Stock
Exchange or Nasdaq are open for trading.

corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, business
trust, unincorporated organization or similar organization, whether domestic or
foreign, together with its direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries and
affiliates (as such term is used in Rule 145 of the Securities Act).

         8.8 Tax Treatment; Tax Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the parties acknowledge and agree that any party (and
each employee, representative, or other agent of the party) may disclose to any
and all persons the tax treatment and tax structure (as such terms are defined
in Treasury Regulations ss. 1.6011-4(c)) of the Transaction and any and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) relating to
such tax treatment or tax structure; provided however that such disclosure may
not be made until the earlier of (i) the date of the public announcement of
discussions relating to the Transaction; (ii) the date of the public
announcement of the Transaction; and (iii) the date of the execution of the
agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into the Transaction. The
preceding sentence is intended to cause the Transaction to be treated as not
having been offered under conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section
1.6011-4(b)(3) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 6011 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and should be construed in a manner
consistent with such purpose.
