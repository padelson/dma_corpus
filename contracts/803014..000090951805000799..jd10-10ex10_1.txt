           1.3 Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters.

           (a) Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

           Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time
before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

           Dollars. Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S.
dollars.

           Exhibits/Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are
hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this
Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise
defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

           Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include
the plural and vice versa.

           Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

           Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

           Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general
statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.


                                       11
<PAGE>
           (b) The obligation of a party to use reasonable commercial efforts to
accomplish an objective means that the obligated party is required to make a
diligent, reasonable and good faith effort to accomplish the applicable
objective. Such obligation, however, does not require any unreasonable
expenditure of funds or incurrence of Liability on the part of the obligated
party (in each case, in the context of the expenditure to be made or Liability
to be incurred); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require that
the obligated party act in a manner that would be contrary to normal commercial
practices in order to accomplish the objective. The fact that the objective is
or is not actually accomplished is no indication that the obligated party did or
did not in fact utilize its reasonable commercial efforts in attempting to
accomplish the objective.

           (c) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

           (d) For purposes of this Agreement, references to documents made
available to Purchaser from the Sellers and/or the Companies shall be deemed to
include only those documents made available, or indicated as made available, in
the online data room maintained by Sellers' counsel prior to October 5, 2005.

                                   ARTICLE II

            SALE AND PURCHASE OF SECURITIES, PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING

           2.1 Sale and Purchase of Securities. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions contained herein, on the Closing Date, each Seller agrees to sell
to Purchaser, free and clear of any and all Liens, and Purchaser agrees to
purchase from each Seller, the Securities owned by such Seller and listed on
Exhibit A hereto.

           2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by
Purchaser for the Securities shall be an amount in cash equal to $251,000,000
(a) less (i) the Aggregate Retention Amount and (ii) any Company Transaction
Expenses unpaid as of the Closing Date and (b) subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 2.3 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to further adjustment as provided
in Section 2.5.

           2.3 Severance Adjustment Amount. If the aggregate of the severance
for the Non-Transferred Employees is less than $3,000,000, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the amount of such difference (the "Severance Amount
Shortfall"). For purposes hereof, the amount of severance for each
Non-Transferred Employee shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of
severance for such Non-Transferred Employee reflected in Exhibit E of the Side
Letter and (b) the amount of severance for such Non-Transferred Employee
determined under the applicable severance policy of the Sellers in effect as of
the date hereof (other than the individuals set forth on Schedule 2.3, which
individuals shall not be considered for purposes of aggregation) and set forth
in the Severance Notice.


                                       12
<PAGE>
           2.4 Payment of Purchase Price. The Side Letter sets forth the
Retention Amount for each Continuing Employee determined (a) as if the Closing
Date were November 30, 2005, (b) assuming that all Business Employees are
Transferred Business Employees and (c) assuming that the CSG Common Stock
Closing Price is $21.70. The Aggregate Retention Amount shall be determined
utilizing the information set forth in the Side Letter and making only necessary
adjustments to contemplate the actual Closing Date, the actual CSG Common Stock
Closing Price, the actual Non-Transferred Employees, any termination of such
rights triggered as a result of the termination of employment of the holder
thereof, any further acceleration of vesting of such options to acquire CSG
Common Stock or shares of CSG Common Stock subject to restrictions, in each
case, in accordance with the Side Letter and the inclusion of additional
Business Employees engaged by the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Companies and Subsidiaries) in the Integrated Customer Management System
business; provided that the aggregate value of the unvested options to acquire
CSG Common Stock (based upon the spread between an assumed stock market price of
$21.70 per share and the exercise price per share) and CSG Common Stock subject
to restrictions (based on a stock market price of $21.70 per share) held by such
additional Business Employees shall not exceed $250,000. The Sellers shall,
within 10 Business Days after the date hereof, provide Purchaser an updated
Exhibit A to the Side Letter solely to reflect the inclusion of additional
Business Employees engaged by the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Companies and Subsidiaries) in the Integrated Customer Management System
business. Two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers and
Purchaser shall agree, in good faith, upon the Escrow Amount and the amount of
adjustments to the Purchase Price contemplated by clause (a) of Section 2.2. On
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price, as so calculated, to
the Sellers in the percentages set forth in a letter to be delivered by the
Sellers to Purchaser at least three (3) days prior to Closing by wire transfer
of immediately available funds into accounts designated in such letter. On the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent in cash
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into the
Escrow Account.

           2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

           (a) Closing Working Capital. Following the Closing, the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted as provided herein in the event that (i) Closing Working
Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, (ii) Purchaser elects to
acquire the Excess Cash Amount by paying the amount calculated in accordance
with Section 7.3(e) or (iii) the Cash of the Companies and Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Cash") exceeds $1,100,000. "Target Working
Capital" shall be negative $21,000,000. "Closing Working Capital" means (A) the
combined Included Current Assets of the Companies and Subsidiaries, less (B) the
combined Included Current Liabilities of the Companies and Subsidiaries, plus
(C) the sum of Working Capital Adjustments, all determined as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date. "Included Current Assets" means current assets of


                                       13
<PAGE>
the Companies and Subsidiaries, as defined under, and determined in accordance
with, GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
audited consolidated financial statements of CSG and its subsidiaries for the
most recent fiscal year end as if such accounts were being prepared and audited
as of a fiscal year end. "Included Current Liabilities" means current
liabilities of the Companies and Subsidiaries as defined under, and determined
in accordance with, GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments
and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the audited consolidated financial statements of CSG and its subsidiaries for
the most recent fiscal year end as if such accounts were being prepared and
audited as of a fiscal year end. "Working Capital Adjustments" means the sum of
the following adjustments: (A) a negative adjustment equal to the amount of Cash
of the Companies and Subsidiaries, (B) a negative adjustment equal to
$2,500,000, which is related to a predetermined adjustment for the allowance for
doubtful accounts, (C) a negative adjustment equal to the excess of (1) the full
amount of unpaid 2005 incentive bonus compensation for Continuing Employees
expected to be accrued as of December 31, 2005 over (2) the amount of accrued
but unpaid 2005 incentive bonus compensation for Continuing Employees reflected
in the Included Liabilities, (D) a negative adjustment equal to the non-current
deferred revenue of the Companies and Subsidiaries, (E) a negative adjustment of
$5,000,000 in respect of a reserve for Taxes (it being understood and agreed
that Included Current Liabilities will not otherwise include any reserve for
income Tax contingencies determined in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5), and (F) the Closing Working Capital Statement shall
not reflect (whether or not it would otherwise reflect) any asset or Liability
in respect of any Tax resulting from, arising out of or based on the sale of the
Securities hereunder, including any Tax arising as a result of the Section
338(h)(10) Election (as defined in Section 9.8) and any income or franchise Tax
payable to any Tax Authority with respect to which the Company or Subsidiary has
filed or will file an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
with a Seller or any of their Affiliates to the extent that such Tax is required
to be paid by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Companies
or Subsidiaries) under applicable Law. All components of Closing Working Capital
shall be calculated after taking into account the actions taken pursuant to
Section 6.10, excluding the FairPoint Business and excluding any intercompany
accounts receivable or accounts payable between the Companies and Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and CSG and its subsidiaries (other than the Companies and
Subsidiaries), on the other. Schedule 2.5(a) provides an illustrative example of
the calculations of Closing Working Capital derived from the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of CSG and its subsidiaries as of June 30,
2005.

           (b) Closing Net Assets Statement. Within 60 days following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers an unaudited combined
statement of net assets of the Companies and Subsidiaries (exclusive of the
assets and Liabilities of the FairPoint Business) as of the opening of business
on the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Assets Statement"), a statement of Closing
Working Capital derived from the Closing Net Assets Statement (the "Closing


                                       14
<PAGE>
Working Capital Statement") and a statement of the Closing Cash, the Excess Cash
Amount and the resulting Cash Adjustment Amount, if any, derived from the
Closing Net Assets Statement (the "Closing Cash Statement"). Schedule 2.5(b)
provides an illustrative example of the calculations of the Cash Adjustment
Amount derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of CSG and
its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005. The Closing Net Assets Statement shall be
derived from the unaudited financial statements of CSG and its subsidiaries
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods,
practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the
preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements for CSG and its
subsidiaries for the most recent fiscal year end as if such Closing Net Assets
Statement was as of a fiscal year end.

           (c) Acceptance of Statements; Dispute Procedures. The Closing Net
Assets Statement, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Closing Cash
Statement delivered by Purchaser to the Sellers shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties unless the Sellers, within 30 days after delivery to the
Sellers of the Closing Net Assets Statement, the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Closing Cash Statement, notify Purchaser in writing that the
Sellers dispute any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the nature of
the dispute and the basis therefor. The parties shall in good faith attempt to
resolve any dispute and, if the parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Net
Assets Statement, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Closing Cash
Statement, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution of the
dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If the parties do not
reach agreement in resolving the dispute within 20 days after notice is given by
the Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to the second preceding sentence, the parties
shall submit the dispute to a mutually satisfactory partner in the New York City
office of the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if no partner at
such firm will act, to a partner at such other nationally recognized independent
accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to the parties (who shall not have
any material relationship with Purchaser or Seller) (the "Arbiter") for
resolution. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of a partner at an
independent accounting firm to act as Arbiter, the parties shall request the
American Arbitration Association to appoint such a partner, and such appointment
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. Promptly, but no later than 20
days after acceptance of his or her appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter shall
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the Arbiter
shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on
written submissions by Purchaser and the Seller, and not by independent review,
only those issues in dispute and shall render a written report as to the
resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of the Closing Working
Capital and the Cash Adjustment Amount which shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties. All proceedings conducted by the Arbiter shall take place in The
City of New York. In resolving any disputed item, the Arbiter (x) shall be bound
by the provisions of this Section 2.5 and (y) may not assign a value to any item


                                       15
<PAGE>
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Arbiter shall be allocated to and borne by Purchaser and the
Sellers based on the inverse of the percentage that the Arbiter's determination
(before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Arbiter. For example, should the items in dispute
total in amount to $1,000 and the Arbiter awards $600 in favor of the Seller's
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Purchaser and 40% of
the costs would be borne by the Seller.

           (d) Payment. Upon final determination of Closing Working Capital as
provided in Section 2.5(c) above, if Closing Working Capital is less than Target
Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the excess (the
"Purchase Price Decrease") of Target Working Capital over the Closing Working
Capital. Upon final determination of the Cash Adjustment Amount, if any, as
provided in Section 2.5(c) above, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
Cash Adjustment Amount, if any, (the "Purchase Price Increase"). If the Purchase
Price Decrease exceeds the Purchase Price Increase, the Sellers shall promptly
pay to Purchaser the amount of such excess no later than five (5) Business Days
after such final determination, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of payment thereof at the "prime" rate, as announced by The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, from time to time to be in effect,
calculated based on a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed, and
all amounts in the Escrow Account shall be released to Purchaser. If the
Purchase Price Increase exceeds the Purchase Price Decrease, Purchaser shall
promptly pay to the Sellers in the percentages set forth in the letter
referenced in Section 2.4 the amount of such excess no later than five (5)
Business Days after such final determination, together with interest thereon
from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the "prime" rate,
calculated as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Any payment to be
made by Purchaser to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) will first be
made as a payment from the Escrow Account and any amounts remaining in the
Escrow Account thereafter shall be released to Purchaser.

           2.6 Closing Date. The consummation of the sale and purchase of the
Securities provided for in Section 2.1 hereof (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP located at 767 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10153 (or at such other place as the parties may designate in
writing) at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the
parties (the "Closing Date"), which date shall be no later than the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such
time), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

           2.7 Seller Deliveries on the Closing Date. At the Closing, the
Sellers shall deliver or cause each Company to deliver, as applicable, to
Purchaser:

           (a) Copies of resolutions, certified by the Secretary of each Company

to Section 6.10.

           (c) Certificates from the Sellers representing the Securities, duly

each state in which such Company is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation; and

           (e) An affidavit of non-foreign status of CSG that complies with
Section 1445 of the Code and an affidavit of CSG International that none of the
Securities being sold by CSG Netherlands CV is a "U.S. real property interest"
within the meaning of Section 1445.

           2.8 Joint Deliveries on Closing Date. At the Closing, the Purchaser
and the Sellers shall deliver to each other their respective portions of:

           (a) The fully-executed Transition Services Agreement;

           (b) The fully-executed Distribution Agreement; and

           (c) The fully-executed Escrow Agreement.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE SELLERS

"SEC") all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other documents
required to be filed under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), or the Securities Act, (collectively, the "SEC Documents"). As of its
filing date or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each SEC
Document, to the extent that it relates to the Companies, Subsidiaries or the
Business, fully complied with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder. As of its filing date, or, if amended, as of
the date of the last such amendment, each SEC Document filed pursuant to the
Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact with respect to the Companies, Subsidiaries or the
Business necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Companies
or Subsidiaries is or has been required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. All of the audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the SEC
Documents, to the extent that they relate to the Companies, Subsidiaries or the
Business (i) have been prepared from, are in accordance with and accurately
reflect the books and records of CSG and its consolidated subsidiaries, (ii)
fully comply with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (including Regulation
S-X), (iii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted
under the Exchange Act with respect to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and (iv)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows (subject, in the case


                                       19
<PAGE>
of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year end adjustments) of
CSG and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods
referred to therein. The reports of CSG's independent auditors regarding CSG's
consolidated financial statements in the SEC filings, to the extent they relate
to the Companies, Subsidiaries or the Business, have not been withdrawn,
supplemented or modified, and none of CSG or any of its subsidiaries has
received any communication from its independent auditors concerning any such
withdrawal, supplement or modification. CSG has provided to Purchaser copies of
all issued auditors' reports, letters to management regarding accounting
practices and systems of internal controls, and all responses to such letters
from management, in each case to the extent relating to the Companies, the
Subsidiaries or the Business, whether the same are issued to CSG or any of its
subsidiaries.

           (b) CSG has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) with
respect to the Companies, Subsidiaries and the Business; such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Companies, Subsidiaries and the Business is made known to CSG's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within
those entities; and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting CSG's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
under the Exchange Act to be included in CSG's periodic reports with respect to
the Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Business.

           3.7 Financial Advisors. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7, no
Person has acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial
advisor for any Seller, Company or Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no Person is or will be entitled
to any fee or commission or like payment in respect thereof.

Purchaser that:

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each Company is duly qualified or authorized to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property and each other
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties requires such qualification or authorization, except where the
failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had, nor would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

           4.2 Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.2 sets forth the name of each Subsidiary
and, with respect to each Subsidiary, the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, the jurisdictions, if any, in which it is qualified
to do business, the number of shares of its authorized capital stock (if any),
the number and class of shares or other equity interests thereof duly issued and
outstanding, the names of all stockholders or other equity owners and the number
of shares of stock owned by each stockholder or the amount of equity owned by
each equity owner. Each Subsidiary is a duly organized and validly existing
corporation, partnership or other entity in good standing under the laws of the

jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties requires such qualification or authorization, except where the

Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or entity power and
authority to own its properties and carry on its business as presently
conducted. The outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests (if
any) of each Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
were not issued in violation of any purchase or call option, right of first
refusal, subscription right, preemptive right or any similar right. All such
shares or other equity interests (if any) represented as being owned by any of
the Companies or Subsidiaries are owned by them free and clear of any and all
Liens, except as set forth in Schedule 4.2. There is no existing option,
warrant, call, right or Contract to which any Subsidiary is a party requiring,
and there are no convertible securities of any Subsidiary outstanding which upon
conversion would require, the issuance of any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of any Subsidiary or other securities convertible into shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of any Subsidiary. No Company owns,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or equity securities of any Person
other than the Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2 and to the
Knowledge of the Sellers and the Companies, there are no contractual
restrictions on the ability of the Subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to
their respective equity holders.

exercise of an incentive award), finders fee, commission or similar payment as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby. No amount that could be received

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any officer,
director, employee or independent contractor of any of the Companies, the
Subsidiaries or the Business, who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in
proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1), would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not transactions described in
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

           (c) With respect to each Benefit Plan described in Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA (each, a "Foreign Plan"): (i) all contributions and other payments
required by Law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made or, if
applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the
fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the Liability of
each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the
Closing Date, with respect to all current or former participants in such plan
according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determined employer contributions to such Foreign Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause the assets or insurance obligations
to be less than such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign Plan required
to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable regulatory authorities.

           (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(d), with respect to any of
the Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Business, there is not currently pending
or existing and, to the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, there is not
threatened, (i) any strike or other industrial action, including slowdown, work
to rule, picketing or work stoppage, (ii) any application for certification of a

          organization in respect of superannuation benefits for any of the
          employees or sub-contractors of CSG Australia.

               (ii) CSG Australia has complied with its obligations under

          payments) in accordance with the Superannuation Guarantee
          (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth) ("SGAA") and other associated Acts and
          Regulations and an additional contribution of 1% of superannuation
          salaries.

               (iv) CSG Australia solely contributes to, and has an obligation

          the Business) and the unaudited combined statement of pre-tax results
          of operations of the Companies and Subsidiaries (exclusive of the
          revenues and expenses associated with the FairPoint Business and
          including the Corporate expenses related to the Business) for the year
          ended December 31, 2004; and

               (ii) the unaudited combined statement of net assets of the
          Companies and Subsidiaries (exclusive of the assets and Liabilities of
          the FairPoint Business and the Corporate assets and Liabilities
          related to the Business) as of June 30, 2005 (such statement of net
          assets being referred to as the "Net Assets Statement") and the
          unaudited combined statement of pre-tax results of operations of the
          Companies and Subsidiaries (exclusive of the revenues and expenses
          associated with the FairPoint Business and including Corporate
          expenses related to the Business) for the six-month period ended June
          30, 2005. For purposes hereof, "Corporate" means the assets,
          Liabilities and expenses related to the Business Employees and certain
          activities related to the Business that are not recorded in the books
          and records of the Companies and Subsidiaries.

           (b) The Financial Statements referred to in clause (i) of Section
4.12(a) were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of CSG
and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and the Financial Statements referred to in clause (ii) of
Section 4.12(a) were derived from the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of CSG and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP for the
six (6) months ended June 30, 2005. The Financial Statements were prepared on
the basis of the books and records of the Companies, the Subsidiaries and, to
the extent applicable, the Sellers (in each case, as of the date of such
Financial Statements) and present fairly, in all material respects, the net
assets (exclusive of the assets and Liabilities of the FairPoint Business and
the Corporate assets and Liabilities related to the Business) of the Companies
and Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the results of their pre-tax
operations (excluding the revenues and expenses associated with the FairPoint
Business and including Corporate expenses relating to the Business) for each of
the periods then ended. With respect to each Contract of the Business as to
which revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion or proportional
performance accounting basis as reflected in the Financial Statements, the
estimated work completed to date used by the Sellers in their accounting
conclusions represents the best estimate of the Companies and Subsidiaries of
the work completed under such Contract as compared with the entire amount of
work required under such Contract.

           (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(c), none of the Companies
nor any of the Subsidiaries has any Liability of any kind whatsoever (whether
known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute or contingent) and there is no
existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to result in any such Liability, except for (a) Liabilities shown on
the Net Assets Statement, (b) Liabilities which have arisen since the date of
the Net Asset Statement in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past
practices and which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, nor would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or (c) Liabilities
under Contracts that do not arise from a breach or default thereunder.

           (d) All books, records and accounts of the Companies and Subsidiaries
are accurate and complete, in all material respects, and are maintained in all
material respects in accordance with good business practice and all applicable
Laws. The Companies and Subsidiaries maintain systems of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets and
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general
or specific authorization.

           (e) Schedule 4.12(e) sets forth (i) all significant deficiencies
identified to CSG by its auditors in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect the ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data relating to the Business, (ii) any material weaknesses
identified to CSG by its auditors in internal controls relating to the Business
and (iii) the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the internal controls with respect to the Business.

conducted their respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business
and, since such date, there has not been any effect, occurrence, development or
state of circumstances or facts (including any damage, destruction or other
casualty loss (whether or not covered by insurance) affecting any Company or
Subsidiary) which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would be
reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(f) and,
with respect to clause (iii) below, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement, since December 31, 2004:

          or Subsidiary of any outstanding shares of capital stock or other
          securities of, or other ownership interest in, any Company or any

          Company, any of the Subsidiaries, or the Business, which employees
          were not subject to a collective bargaining agreement at the date of
          the most recent Financial Statements, or any lockouts, strikes,

          Business) or paid any fees or expenses to the Sellers (except in the
          Ordinary Course of Business) or any director, officer, partner,
          stockholder or Affiliate of the Seller (other than advancement to or
          reimbursement of travel and similar expenses for employees);

               (viii) no Company or Subsidiary has (A) mortgaged, charged,

           4.13 Intellectual Property.

           (a) Schedule 4.13(a) sets forth a complete and correct list of
registered copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, and patents,
together with registrations and applications for registration therefor, owned by
any Company or Subsidiary and material to the Business (collectively, the
"Registered Intellectual Property").

           (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.13(b):

               (i) The operation of the Business by the Companies and the
          Subsidiaries does not (and will not, upon consummation of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement) infringe, misappropriate,
          or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any third
          Person. There is no Legal Proceeding pending against, and, to the
          Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, no claim or threat
          received in writing against, any Company or Subsidiary (i)
          challenging, or seeking to deny or restrict any Intellectual Property
          rights of any Company or Subsidiary or (ii) alleging that the
          operation of the Business misappropriates, infringes or otherwise
          violates any Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the
          Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, no Seller, Company or
          Subsidiary has received a written offer within the past three (3)
          years from any Person to license rights under a patent in connection
          with the operation of the Business.

<PAGE>
               (ii) The Companies and Subsidiaries own or have a valid right to
          use all copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, patents
          and other Intellectual Property material to and used in the Business
          (the "Business Intellectual Property"). As of the Closing Date and
          except as disclosed to Purchaser in accordance with Section 6.15(a) by
          the date required therein, the consummation of the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, impair or extinguish
          any Business Intellectual Property or the Purchaser's right to use any
          of the Business Intellectual Property. None of the Business
          Intellectual Property which is owned by the Companies and Subsidiaries
          has been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in whole or part.

               (iii) One or more of the Companies or Subsidiaries holds all
          right, title and interest in and to all Business Intellectual Property
          owned by any Company or Subsidiary, free and clear of any Lien, except
          as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (iv) To the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, the
          Companies and Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to maintain the
          confidentiality of all confidential information in their respective
          possession. To the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, there
          is no infringement of the Business Intellectual Property by any third
          party. It is the policy of the Companies and Subsidiaries that
          employees execute agreements assigning all Intellectual Property
          created in the course of their employment to the relevant Company or
          Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, all
          employees of the Companies and Subsidiaries who make material
          contributions to the Intellectual Property activities have executed
          such agreements.

           (c) Intentionally omitted.

           (d) To the Knowledge of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, each of
the Intellectual Property Contracts with the vendors or with respect to the
products set forth on Schedule 4.13(c) is in full force and effect and is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable Company and/or Subsidiary,
enforceable against the applicable Company and/or Subsidiary thereto in
accordance with its terms. No Company or Subsidiary is in default in any
material respect under any such Contracts with respect to Intellectual Property
rights, nor, to the Knowledge of the Companies and the Sellers, is any other
party to any such Intellectual Property Contract in default thereunder, and no
event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a default thereunder. No party to any of such Intellectual
Property Contracts has exercised any termination rights with respect thereto.

           (e) To the Knowledge of the Sellers, the Companies and Subsidiaries
have taken reasonable steps to preserve and maintain records relating to the
Business Intellectual Property.

           4.14 Brokers. Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.7, no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of any of the Companies or Subsidiaries.

discuss matters involving the operations and business of any of the Companies or
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, with representatives of Purchaser.

applicable Law. No information provided to or obtained by Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 6.1 shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Purchaser (including Purchaser's right to seek indemnification
pursuant to Article VIII or IX), or the representations or warranties of, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereto.

               (xxi) agree to do anything (or omit from doing anything solely in
          respect of clause (B)) (A) prohibited by this Section 6.2, (B) which
          the Sellers or the Companies knew or would reasonably be expected to
          have known would make any of the representations and warranties of the
          Sellers in this Agreement or any of the Seller Documents or Company
          Documents untrue or incorrect in any material respect or could result
          in any of the conditions to the Closing not being satisfied or (C)
          that would have, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Material
          Adverse Effect.

           (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except the
final sentence of this Section 6.2(c), neither the Reorganization nor any aspect
thereof shall (1) constitute a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement hereunder or (2) give rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(v) and Section 9.1(ii)).
"Reorganization" means (i) the extraction of Cash by the Sellers and their
Affiliates from the Companies and Subsidiaries, by dividend or other means, and
any related actions including conversion of CSG International Limited to an
unlimited liability company (and any related change in ownership thereof among
the Companies and Subsidiaries and related assumption of Liabilities thereof),
(ii) elections under Treasury Regulation Sections 301.7701-1(3)(c) to treat


                                       47
<PAGE>
certain Subsidiaries as disregarded entities and (iii)(A) the transfer to, and
assumption by, any Company or Subsidiary of assets or properties (including
contract rights and other intangible assets) and related Liabilities of the
Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies or Subsidiaries), which
(1) are used or primarily related to the Business or (2) are set forth on
Schedule 6.2(c) and (B) the transfer by the Companies and Subsidiaries to, and
assumption by, the Sellers and any of their Affiliates (other than the Companies
and Subsidiaries) of any and all assets or properties (including contractual
rights or other intangible assets) and related Liabilities which are not used to
any significant extent in the Business, including the FairPoint Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not take or omit to take, or
cause or permit any of the Companies or Subsidiaries to take or omit to take,
any action in connection with the Reorganization that would impair or adversely
affect in any material respect the operations of the Business after the Closing,
it being understood that (x) the extraction of Cash from the Company and
Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to impair or adversely affect such operations
unless the same affects the ability to satisfy immediate Cash needs (such as
payroll) or to satisfy performance bonds or similar commitments at or after
Closing (and such condition did not exist prior the taking of actions
contemplated by clause (i) of the definition of Reorganization) and (y) the
conversion contemplated by clause (i) of the definition of Reorganization and
the elections contemplated by clause (ii) of the definition of Reorganization
shall not be deemed to impair or adversely affect such operations.

           6.3 Third Party Consents. The Sellers and Companies shall use, and
the Companies shall cause the Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents, waivers and
approvals from, and provide all notices to, all Persons that are not
Governmental Bodies, which consents, waivers, approvals and notices are required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the absence of
which would result in (a) a Liability to any Company or Subsidiary or (b) the
loss of any material benefit to which any Company or Subsidiary is entitled
under, any Material Contract, including the consents, waivers, approvals and
notices referred to in Sections 3.3(b) and 4.4(b) hereof (except for such
matters covered by Section 6.4). All such consents, waivers, approvals and
notices shall be in writing and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and
executed counterparts of such consents, waivers and approvals shall be delivered
to Purchaser promptly after receipt thereof, and copies of such notices shall be
delivered to Purchaser promptly after the making thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates (which for purposes of this sentence shall include the Companies)
shall be required to pay any amounts in connection with obtaining any consent,
waiver or approval other than as set forth in the Side Letter.

           6.4 Governmental Consents and Approvals.

           (a) Each of Purchaser, the Sellers and the Companies shall use, and
the Companies shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to use, their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practical date all waivers, Permits
and declarations from, make all filings with, and provide all notices to, all
Governmental Bodies which are required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including such waivers, Orders, Permits,
declarations, filings and notices that are referred to in Sections 3.3(b) and


                                       48
<PAGE>
4.4(b). Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, the Sellers and the Companies
shall (i) make all filings required of each of them or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and,
in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement in
the case of all filings required under the HSR Act and within four (4) weeks in
the case of all other filings required by other Antitrust Laws, (ii) promptly
comply with any request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional
information, documents, or other materials received by each of them or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(the "Antitrust Division") or any other Governmental Body in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection
with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing
and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental
Body under any Antitrust Law with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish to each other party hereto all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly
inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such
filings or any such transaction and permit the other party to review in advance
any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Body. No party
hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto shall consult
and cooperate with one another in connection with the matters described in this
Section 6.4, including in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.

           (b) Each of Purchaser, the Sellers and the Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any Law, including the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, that is designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the
"Antitrust Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of any Law, Purchaser, the


                                       49
<PAGE>
Sellers and the Companies shall, subject to the mutual agreement of CSG and
Purchaser, cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal. Each of the parties shall enter into such mutual agreement unless, in
its reasonable judgment, the taking of the action in question is not in its
business interests. Each of Purchaser, the Sellers and the Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this sentence
shall include the Companies and Subsidiaries) shall be required, in connection
with the matters covered by this Section 6.4, (i) to hold separate (including by
trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective businesses, product lines
or assets or (ii) to agree to any limitation on the operation or conduct of the
Business.

           6.5 Further Assurances. Subject to, and not in limitation of, Section
6.4, each of the Companies, the Sellers and Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to its respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers and Purchaser agree, and the Sellers
prior to Closing, and Purchaser, after the Closing, agree to cause each Company
and Subsidiary, to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary
or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

           6.6 Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

           (a) For a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly cause,
solicit, induce or encourage any employees of the Companies or Subsidiaries or
any employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates (which, for these purposes, includes
the Companies and Subsidiaries) engaged primarily in the Business prior to the
Closing to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such
individual (other than through generalized searches for employees through media
advertisements, employment firms or otherwise that are not focused on Persons
employed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or their successors); provided,
however, that should a Transferred Employee elect not to accept employment with
Purchaser, such Transferred Employee may, with the consent of Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, maintain his or her employment with
Seller; provided, further, that such Transferred Employee shall be made
available to Purchaser and its Affiliates as a consultant for a period of up to
six (6) months following the Closing as needed by Purchaser at cost (calculated
as a percentage of base salary assuming a 40-hour work week) to be paid by
Purchaser. This restriction shall not apply to any Transferred Business Employee
whose employment with Purchaser or its successor is terminated by Purchaser or
its successor after the Closing


                                       50
<PAGE>
           (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not and shall
cause their officers and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers,
directors and employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates (which for this purpose
shall include the Companies and Subsidiaries) or use or otherwise exploit for
its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser, any
Confidential Information (as defined below). The Sellers shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential (or cause their officers, directors or
Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Law or is
generally required to reply to a request by a Governmental Authority; provided,
however, that in the event disclosure is requested or required by a Governmental
Authority (by requests for information or documents or subpoenas), the Sellers
shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide Purchaser with prompt notice
of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order. For purposes of this Section 6.6(b), "Confidential
Information" means any information with respect to any of the Companies or
Subsidiaries or otherwise primarily used in connection with the Business,
including methods of operation, customer lists, products, prices, fees, costs,
technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software, marketing methods,
plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized
information or proprietary matters. "Confidential Information" does not include,
and there shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i)
is generally available to the public on the date of this Agreement, (ii) becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not
otherwise permissible hereunder, (iii) although related to the Companies or
Subsidiaries and/or primarily used in connection with the Business, is also used
by the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies or Subsidiaries)
prior to the Closing Date or (iv) is otherwise required as expressly provided in
the Ancillary Agreements.

           (c) The covenants and undertakings contained in this Section 6.6
relate to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and
a violation of any of the terms of this Section 6.6 will cause irreparable
injury to Purchaser or any Seller, as applicable, the amount of which will be
impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated.
Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of this Section 6.6 will be
inadequate. Therefore, Purchaser or any Seller, as applicable, will be entitled
to a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining order or other equitable
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of
this Section 6.6 without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any
bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this Section 6.6 are
cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser or
any Seller, as applicable, may have hereunder or at law or in equity.


                                       51
<PAGE>
           (d) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent
jurisdiction determines that a specified time period or any other relevant
feature of this Section 6.6 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy,
then the maximum enforceable period of time, geographical area, business
limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against
the applicable party.

           6.7 Preservation of Records. Subject to Section 9.16 and any
retention requirements relating to the preservation of Tax records, the Sellers
and Purchaser agree that each of them shall (and shall cause the Companies and
Subsidiaries to) preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
respective businesses of the Companies and Subsidiaries for a period of seven
(7) years from the Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel
available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party in connection
with, among other things, any insurance claims by, legal proceedings against or
governmental investigations of the Purchaser, any of the Sellers, Companies or
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable the Sellers or
Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and
each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby. In
the event the Sellers or Purchaser wishes to destroy (or permit to be destroyed)
such records after that time, such party shall first give 60 days prior written
notice to the other and such other party shall have the right at its option and
expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that 60 day
period, to take possession of the records within 30 days after the date of such
notice.

           6.8 Publicity.

           (a) None of the Purchaser, the Sellers or the Companies shall issue
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of
the other parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, unless disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or its Affiliates or
CSG lists securities, provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law or
by the applicable rules of any stock exchange, the party intending to make such
release shall (i) promptly notify the other parties, and (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult
with the other parties with respect to the text thereof and (iii) cooperate with
the other parties to narrow the scope of the disclosure required to be made.

           (b) Each of Purchaser, the Sellers and the Companies agrees that the
terms of this Agreement shall not be disclosed or otherwise made available to
the public and that copies of this Agreement shall not be publicly filed or
otherwise made available to the public, except where such disclosure,
availability or filing is required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of
any stock exchange.

           6.9 Use of Name.

           (a) The Sellers hereby agree that upon the Closing, Purchaser, the
Companies and Subsidiaries shall have the sole right to the use of any service

name or mark confusingly similar thereto and the marks listed on Schedule
4.13(a), other than the Seller Name (collectively, the "Company Marks").
Schedule 6.9 sets forth a complete and correct list of the trade names and
fictitious names included in the Company Marks currently used in the Business as

the Ancillary Agreements. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than 120 days following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Company Marks from all materials
held by, or under the control of, the Sellers and their post-closing Affiliates,
including any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging
materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer
software and other materials. The Sellers shall not be obligated to change the
Company Marks on goods in the hands of dealers, distributors, representatives,
agents and customers at the time of the expiration of the 120 day time period
set forth above, provided such goods have been shipped or distributed in the
Ordinary Course of Business prior to Closing.

          that is not part of the Business Intellectual Property being
          transferred to Purchaser from all buildings, offices and signs of the
          Business;

               (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable using Purchaser's
          reasonable commercial efforts, but in any event no longer than 180

          agents and customers at the time of the expiration of a time period
          set forth in Section 6.9(b)(i) and (iii) above provided such goods
          have been shipped or distributed in the Ordinary Course of Business.

               (v) Purchaser shall have the right to use the Seller Name in
          advertising that was placed by Seller, any Company or Subsidiary prior
          to the Closing; provided that Purchaser shall make commercially
          reasonable efforts to discontinue the use of Seller Name in the
          advertising after the Closing Date; provided, further, that Purchaser

               (vii) In no event shall Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser

           6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. The Sellers shall give notice
to Purchaser and Purchaser shall give notice to the Seller, as promptly as
reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change, condition,
circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused or is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement made

hereunder to the party receiving such notice, or the representations or
warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereto.

           6.13 Employees.

           (a) The Side Letter sets forth the severance payable to each Business
Employee if such Business Employee were a Non-Transferred Employee who will be
severed by the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Companies and
Subsidiaries) following the Closing Date and in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the
Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of (i) any offer of
employment to any New Hire in accordance with Section 6.2(b)(v), indicating for
each, the name, start date, position, job location, base salary, commission
eligibility and incentive plan target and (ii) the termination of the employment
or commencement of any disability or leave of absence of any Business Employee,
indicating, where relevant, the term of any such approved leave of absence. Not
less than 20 Business Day prior to the scheduled Closing, the Sellers shall
deliver to Purchaser updates to Exhibits B, C, D and E of the Side Letter but
only to the extent that such updated information, together with the information
provided in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, would not be complete and
accurate as of such date. Not less than 15 days prior to the scheduled Closing,
Purchaser shall, in compliance with applicable Law, identify in writing all
Business Employees to be transferred to a Company or Subsidiary and indicating
the applicable transferee Company or Subsidiary for each such Business Employee
(the "Transfer Notice"). Not less than 10 days prior to the scheduled Closing,
the Sellers shall, or shall cause their applicable Affiliates (other than the


                                       55
<PAGE>
Companies and Subsidiaries) to, transfer all such Business Employees so
identified by Purchaser in accordance with this Section 6.13(a) but excluding
any such U.S. employees on long-term disability (the "Transferred Business
Employees"), and the Sellers shall cause the transferee Companies and
Subsidiaries to employ such Transferred Business Employees. Not less than 10
days prior to the scheduled Closing, the Sellers shall notify Purchaser in
writing, with respect to each Non-Transferred Employee, the severance to which
each such employee would be entitled upon being severed by the Sellers
calculated in accordance with the severance policy set forth in Schedule 6.13(b)
(the "Severance Notice"). Not less than 10 days prior to the scheduled Closing,
the Sellers shall cause each applicable Company or Subsidiary to transfer all
employees whose services are not primarily dedicated to the Business, including
all such employees who have rights of employment on return from any leave or
other absence, and the Sellers shall, or shall cause their applicable Affiliates
(other than the Companies and Subsidiaries) to, employ such employees. The
Sellers and Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute an event entitling any Transferred Business
Employee to severance benefits. Immediately following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause each Company and each Subsidiary to continue the
employment of each of their respective employees, including the Transferred
Business Employees (each, a "Continuing Employee"); provided, however, that any
U.S. employee of a Company or Subsidiary who as of the Closing Date is not
actively at work as a result of long-term disability shall not be a Continuing
Employee unless and until such employee presents himself or herself to return to
work within 180 days after the Closing Date. Subject to applicable Law, nothing
in this Section 6.13 shall limit the right of the Companies and Subsidiaries to
dismiss any of their employees at any time and for any reason and to change the
terms and conditions of their employment (including compensation and employee
benefits provided to them).

           (b) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing, Purchaser shall
cause the applicable Company or the Subsidiary to provide to each Continuing
Employee (i) annualized salary equal to 100% of the annualized base salary
provided to such Employee by Seller, Company or Subsidiaries immediately prior
to Closing, and (ii) a bonus opportunity and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide or shall cause to be
provided to any U.S. Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during
the six (6) month period following the Closing a severance payment calculated in
accordance with the severance policy set forth in Schedule 6.13(b). In addition
to any severance payments that may be due, if any Continuing Employee is
terminated after the Closing, Purchaser will provide or cause to be provided
100% of the 2005 Annual Bonus that such Continuing Employee would have been
entitled to if they had been employed as of the bonus payment date to the extent
accrued and not yet paid. With respect to the Continuing Employees, each
employee medical, dental, vision care and prescription drug plan, program,
policy and arrangement of Purchaser shall waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was waived under the corresponding
Benefit Plan) and any proof of insurability and shall recognize, for purposes of
satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, any payment made towards deductibles,
co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums for such calendar year under the
corresponding Benefit Plan. The Sellers agree to transfer the cafeteria plan
accounts and experience of Continuing Employees (to the extent applicable) to
substantially equivalent plans that exist or will be established by Purchaser.
The Sellers and Purchaser agree to determine the terms and conditions of such
transfer. All service by a Continuing Employee with the Seller, including
service with predecessor employers that was recognized by the Sellers and their
Affiliates, shall be recognized by Purchaser for purposes of vacation
entitlement and participation and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual) under the benefits of Purchaser, including any defined benefit or


                                       56
<PAGE>
defined contribution pension plans, welfare benefit plans and severance plans of
Purchaser to the same extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan. Purchaser will continue to provide relocation assistance to those
Continuing Employees receiving it as of the Closing Date and tuition assistance
to those Continuing Employees who are receiving such benefits as of the Closing
Date for the academic session then in effect (the "Relocation and Tuition
Benefits") to the extent set forth in Schedule 6.13(b)(i). With respect to
Continuing Employees who are on international assignment as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser will provide the benefits provided under CSG's international assignee
program as in effect as of Closing, including repatriation upon completion of
assignment, completion bonuses, Tax equalization and Tax Return preparation.
Purchaser shall assume, or shall cause the applicable Company or Subsidiary to
retain, all Liabilities with respect to, and honor the vacation, personal days
and floating holidays accrued but unused by, each Continuing Employee as of the
Closing, and Purchaser or any Company or Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall
be solely liable for such accruals to the extent accrued on the most recent
Financial Statements (the "Accrued Days").

           (c) Purchaser shall make and be responsible for the payment of all
accrued but unpaid incentive compensation of each Continuing Employee for the
2005 calendar year (the "2005 Annual Bonus").

           (d) Purchaser shall cause the tax-qualified defined contribution plan
established or maintained by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Savings Plan") to accept
eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from U.S. Continuing Employees with respect to any account balances distributed
to them on or as of the Closing Date by the CSG Incentive Savings Plan.
Rollovers of outstanding loans under the CSG Incentive Savings Plan shall be
permitted. The distribution and rollover described herein shall comply with
applicable Law and each party shall make all filings and take any actions
required of such party under applicable Law in connection therewith. Purchaser
and the Sellers agree that U.S. Continuing Employees who are participants in the
CSG Incentive Savings Plan who elect to roll over their outstanding loans
thereunder to Purchaser's Savings Plan shall inform the plan administrator of
the CSG Incentive Savings Plan by a predetermined date to be mutually agreed
upon by Purchaser and the Sellers, and the Sellers shall cause the recordkeeper
for the CSG Incentive Savings Plan to provide a data file to the plan
administrator of Purchaser's Savings Plan in a format identified by such plan
administrator that includes all such participants who have elected to roll over
their outstanding loans. No rollovers of outstanding loans under the CSG
Incentive Savings Plan shall be accepted by Purchaser's Savings Plan from
individual participants who have not made the election by the predetermined
date.

           (e) The Sellers shall be responsible for and shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser for any failure to provide health continuation
coverage (including any penalties, excise taxes or interest resulting from the
failure to provide continuation coverage) required by Section 4980B of the Code
(i) with respect to each current or former employee of the Sellers, their
Affiliates, Companies or Subsidiaries other than the Continuing Employees, due
to qualifying events whenever occurring, (ii) with respect to each Continuing


                                       57
<PAGE>
Employee, due to qualifying events which occur on or before the Closing Date,
and (iii) with respect to each U.S. employee of a Company or Subsidiary who as
of the Closing Date is not actively at work as a result of long-term disability,
due to qualifying events which occur before the date such employee presents
himself or herself to return to work in accordance with Section 6.13(a).
Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers for any failure to provide health continuation coverage (including
any penalties, excise taxes or interest resulting from the failure to provide
continuation coverage) required by Section 4980B of the Code with respect to
each Continuing Employee due to qualifying events which occur after the Closing
Date. The Sellers shall be responsible for providing any applicable COBRA
notices to any Business Employee in respect of events occurring prior to such
Business Employee's transfer to a Company or Subsidiary in accordance with
Section 6.13(a).

           (f) Nothing in this Section 6.13 will be or be deemed to be for the
benefit of or enforceable by, any Person who is not a party hereto, including,
without limitation, any director, officer, employee or independent contractor of
any Seller, Company or Subsidiary or their respective affiliates. Furthermore,
nothing in this Section 6.13 will be or be deemed to be an amendment of a
Benefit Plan.

           (g) To the extent that the rights and obligations of the employees of
the Companies, Subsidiaries or the Business and their respective employers
(whether in respect of any Benefit Plan), are regulated by applicable Law and/or
any collective bargaining agreement, the Sellers and Purchaser shall fully
cooperate (and the Sellers shall cause the relevant Companies and Subsidiaries
to fully cooperate with Purchaser) for the purpose of ensuring that such Laws
and collective bargaining agreements are fully complied with at all times up to
the Closing Date, and at any time thereafter in respect of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. After Closing, the Sellers will provide
Purchaser with information reasonably required by Purchaser and otherwise will
provide Purchaser with reasonable assistance in relation to the Company Plans,
including any superannuation contribution arrangements (excluding the funding of
such arrangements), any of the Companies and Subsidiaries have in place as at
Closing

           (h) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause CSG
Software to terminate the CSG Software, Inc. Wealth Accumulation Plan and to pay
promptly the account balances thereunder to the participants therein in
accordance with the terms thereof.

           6.14 Certain Tax Matters. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to file, or caused to be filed, all Tax Returns due (taking into account
any available extensions of time to file) on or before the Closing Date. CSG
Netherlands shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a request for a ruling
from the appropriate Tax Authority in the Netherlands that dividends paid to CSG
Netherlands qualify for the participation exemption as soon as practicable, it
being understood that CSG Netherlands currently intends to file a request for
such a ruling on or before October 14, 2005.

Section 8.3(a) before the termination of the applicable Survival Period.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing and solely with respect to this Article

               (i) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the failure of
          any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser in this
          Agreement or in any Purchaser Document to be true and correct at the
          date hereof and as of the Closing Date;

               (ii) based upon, attributable to or resulting from the breach of

          the event and to the extent that such third party claim is based upon,
          attributable to, or results from a breach of any representation or
          warranty of the Sellers contained in this Agreement or in any Seller
          Document.

           (c) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or any
Seller Documents, Company Document or Purchaser Document shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution


                                       66
<PAGE>
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or any
other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

           8.3 Indemnification Procedures.

           (a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third
party claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is
sought; provided, however, that failure to so notify the indemnifying party
shall not preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification which it may
claim in accordance with this Article VIII except to the extent such failure
shall have adversely prejudiced the indemnifying party.

           (b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or
that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of
which indemnification may be sought under Section 8.2 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 8.4) (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnified
party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party
Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be
forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the indemnified party to
give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive
or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto
except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and
prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this Section
8.3, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within 30 days of the indemnified party's
written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the
nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its
intent to do so; provided, that the indemnifying party must conduct the defense
of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve
its rights in this regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the
indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Third Party Claim at its own expense. If the indemnified party defends any
Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified
party for the expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of
periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third


                                       67
<PAGE>
Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense,
in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by
the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such
separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified party in connection with any Third Party Claim. The parties hereto
agree to provide reasonable access to the other to such documents and
information as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 8.3 to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor
the indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party,
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment unless the claimant or claimants and such party provide to
such other party an unqualified release from all Liability in respect of the
Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third
Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

           (c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been
rendered by a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third
Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying
party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall pay
all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the
date of such notice.

           8.4 Limitations on Indemnification for Breaches of Representations
and Warranties.

           (a) An indemnifying party shall not have any Liability under Section
8.2(a)(i), or Section 8.2(b)(i) hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the indemnified parties and indemnifiable thereunder based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the failure of any of the representations or
warranties to be true and correct exceeds three-fourths percent (0.75%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Basket") and, in such event, the indemnifying party shall
be required to pay the amount of all such Losses in excess of the Basket;
provided that the Basket limitation shall not apply to Losses related to the
failure to be true and correct of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in the Seller Special Representations, the Seller Statute of Limitations
Representation and the Purchaser Special Representations. In addition, the
indemnified party shall have no recourse under this Article for any individual
items where the Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000; provided, however,
that such items shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the
Basket has been exceeded in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
8.4(a).


                                       68
<PAGE>
           (b) Neither the Sellers nor Purchaser shall be required to indemnify
any Person under Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(b)(i) for an aggregate amount of
Losses exceeding thirty percent (30%) of the Purchase Price (the "Cap") in
connection with Losses related to the failure to be true and correct of any of
the representations or warranties of the Sellers or Purchaser in Articles III,
IV and V, respectively; provided that there shall be no Cap with respect to
Losses related to the failure to be true and correct of any of the
representations or warranties contained in the Seller Special Representations,
the Seller Statute of Limitations Representation and the Purchaser Special
Representations.

           (c) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants and agreements,
and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

           (d) No action taken by the Sellers, the Companies or the Subsidiaries
in compliance with Section 6.2(c) shall be considered for purposes of
determining the whether any representations or warranties are true and correct
at Closing.

           (e) The representation and warranty contained in Section 4.13(b)(i)
shall be deemed to be qualified by the phrase "To the Knowledge of the Sellers
and the Companies" at the beginning thereof solely for purposes of determining
whether the Sellers shall have Liability for Losses, subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Article VIII, arising from the infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of Intellectual Property rights of any third
party that occurs before or after the Closing in accordance with the example set
forth below. For purposes of clarity, the following example is provided: if the
Sellers and the Companies had no Knowledge of a violation of the Intellectual
Property rights of a third party and it is ultimately determined that such
rights were violated and $100 of Losses (calculated in accordance with the
balance of this Article VIII) resulted therefrom, $40 of which were attributable
to pre-Closing violations and $60 of which were attributable to post-Closing
violations, the Sellers would be responsible only for that portion of the Losses
attributable to pre-Closing violations which would amount to $40 of such Losses.
To the extent that any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
Intellectual Property rights of any third party occurs from and after the
Closing solely as a result of modifications to the Intellectual Property made by
Purchaser, the Sellers shall have no obligation to provide indemnification under
this Article VIII.

           (f) The amount of the indemnifying party's Liability under this
Agreement shall be net of any amounts recovered by the indemnified party under
applicable insurance policies and other savings that have been realized by, the
indemnified party. If an indemnifying party's obligation under Section 8.2 or
Article IX arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to the
indemnified party, any of its Affiliates or, in the case of the Purchaser,
effective upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary any deduction,


                                       69
<PAGE>
amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax Benefit") which
would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then any payment by the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party shall be an amount equal to (x) the
amount otherwise due but for this subsection (d), minus (y) the present value of
the Tax Benefit multiplied by the maximum federal or state, as the case may be,
corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the relevant adjustment is made or, in
the case of a credit, by 100 percent. The present value referred to in the
preceding sentence shall be determined using a discount rate equal to the
mid-term applicable federal rate in effect at the time the relevant adjustment
is made and assuming that the Tax Benefit will be used at the earliest date or
dates allowable by applicable Law; provided, however, that if the Tax Benefit
constitutes an increase in basis of nondepreciable, nonamortizable property, it
shall be taken into account only when actually realized prior to the expiration
of the period provided for in Section 9.12.

           (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages of such other
Person, including loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of value
or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged
breach hereof; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude
recovery by the indemnified party in respect of Losses directly incurred from
Third Party Claims. The Sellers and Purchaser shall each take commercially
reasonable actions to mitigate their damages.

           (h) From and after the Closing, except in the event of fraud (in
which case the parties shall be entitled to exercise all of their rights, and
seek all damages available to them, under law or equity) the sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or
failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance
with this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any)
known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the
future, that it may have against the Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including any such
Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or based upon any
securities Law, common Law or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 8.4(g) shall not operate to interfere with or impede the operation of
the provisions of Article IX or Article II providing for the (i) resolution of
certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price between the parties and/or by an
Arbiter and (ii) limit the rights of the parties to seek equitable remedies
(including specific performance or injunctive relief).

           (i) The Sellers shall have no right of contribution or other recourse
against the Companies or Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns or successors
for any Third Party Claims asserted by Purchaser Indemnified Parties, it being
acknowledged and agreed that the covenants and agreements of the Companies are
solely for the benefit of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.


                                       70
<PAGE>
           (j) Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be responsible for 25% of all
Losses under Section 8.2(a)(viii) up to $1,300,000 on a proportional basis, such
that the Sellers shall indemnify Purchase Indemnified Parties for 75% of Losses
covered by Section 8.2(a)(viii) up to $1,300,000 and 100% of Losses in excess
thereof.

                                   TAX MATTERS

all Taxes required to be borne by the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.9; provided,
however, that the Sellers shall have no obligation pursuant to this Section 9.1

           9.2 Tax Indemnification by Purchaser. Except for any Taxes subject to

           9.3 Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

           (a) Where required or permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers shall
include the Companies and Subsidiaries, or cause the Companies and Subsidiaries
to be included in, and shall file or cause to be filed, (i) the United States
consolidated federal income Tax Returns of the Sellers for the taxable periods
(or portions thereof) of the Companies and Subsidiaries ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) where applicable, all other consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Returns for the taxable periods (or portions thereof) of the

The Sellers shall also (and shall cause the Companies and Subsidiaries to)
timely file all other Tax Returns of or which include the Companies or any of
the Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account any extensions) on or
prior to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid any and all Taxes
shown as due thereon. All Tax Returns described in this Section 9.3(a) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice unless a contrary treatment
is required by applicable Law.

           (b) Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax
Returns (other than those Tax Returns described in Section 9.3(a)) required to
be filed by the Companies and Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and, subject
to the right to payment from the Sellers under Section 9.3(c), pay or cause to
be paid all Taxes shown as due thereon. To the extent any Taxes shown due on any
Tax Return described in this Section 9.3(b) are indemnifiable by the Seller,
such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice
unless a contrary treatment is required by applicable Law, and Purchaser shall
provide (or cause the Companies and Subsidiaries to provide) the Sellers with
copies of such Tax Returns (or, in the case of Tax Returns that include
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser other than the Companies and
Subsidiaries, the portion of such Tax Returns relating to the Companies and the
Subsidiaries) at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing thereof
(including extensions) for the Seller's review and approval and the Sellers


                                       72
<PAGE>
shall have the right (at the Seller's expense) to review all work papers and
procedures used to prepare any such Tax Return. The Sellers and Purchaser shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns
prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the Sellers and Purchaser
are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to Section 9.10, which resolution shall be binding on the
parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 9.3

Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Sellers or the Companies and Subsidiaries to
receive indemnification pursuant to any provision in this Agreement.

           (c) Not later than three (3) days prior to the due date for the

Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to that portion of the Taxes
shown on such return for which the Sellers have an obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1. No
payment pursuant to this Section 9.3(c) shall excuse the Sellers from their
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.1 if the amount of Taxes as
ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered by such
Tax Returns exceeds the amount of the Seller's payment under this Section
9.3(c).

           9.4 Straddle Period Tax Allocation. The parties acknowledge that, for
federal income Tax purposes, the taxable year of the Companies and Subsidiaries
that are U.S. corporations will end as of the close of the Closing Date. With
respect to all other Taxes, the Sellers and Purchaser will, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, take such actions as may be required to close the taxable period
of the Companies and Subsidiaries as of the close of the Closing Date. In any
case where applicable Law does not permit any Company or Subsidiary to close its
taxable year as of the close of the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax
is assessed with respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date
(but does not end on that day) (a "Straddle Period"), then Taxes, if any,
attributable to the taxable period of the Companies and Subsidiaries beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date shall be allocated (i) to the Sellers
for the period up to and including the Closing Date, and (ii) to Purchaser for
the period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or
deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to any period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date shall be made (A) in the case of income
Taxes or Taxes based on or related to income or receipts or any sales or use
Tax, by means of a closing of the books and records of the applicable Company or
Subsidiary as of the close of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but
not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period and (B) in the case
of other Taxes, on a per diem basis. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (A) shall be made in a
manner consistent with the past practice of the relevant Companies and the
Subsidiaries.

           9.5 Tax Audits and Indemnification Procedures.

           (a) If notice of any legal proceeding with respect to Taxes of any of
the Companies or Subsidiaries (a "Tax Claim") shall be received by either the
Sellers or Purchaser for which the other party may reasonably be expected to be
liable pursuant to Section 9.1 or 9.2 respectively, the notified party, within
30 days after receipt of such written notice, shall notify such other party in
writing of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the failure of the notified
party to give the other party notice as provided herein shall not relieve such
other party of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that
such other party is actually prejudiced thereby.

           (b) Purchaser shall have the right, at the expense of the Sellers to
the extent such Tax Claim is subject to indemnification by the Sellers pursuant
to Section 9.1 hereof, to represent the interests of the Companies and
Subsidiaries in any Tax Claim (other than Tax Claims arising out of Tax Returns
referred to in Section 9.3(a) and Tax Claims relating exclusively to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods), provided that the Purchaser shall not settle any such claim
without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If Purchaser elects to represent the interests of the Companies or
Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Claim described in this Section 9.5(b), the
Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in the defense of such claim.

           (c) The Sellers shall have the right to represent the Companies and
Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Claim arising out of a Tax Return referred
to in Section 9.3(a) and any Tax Claim relating exclusively to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period; provided, however, if the result of such Tax Claim involves an issue
that recurs in taxable periods of the Companies or Subsidiaries ending after the
Closing Date or otherwise could materially adversely affect Purchaser or any of
the Companies or Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date, then there shall be no settlement with respect thereto without the consent
of Purchaser, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

           (d) The Sellers may discharge, at any time, their indemnification
obligation under Section 9.1 by paying to the Purchaser the full amount at issue
and payable as of the date of such payment pursuant to Section 9.1, calculated
on the date of such payment.

           9.6 Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements. Any and all Tax
allocation or Tax sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements
relating to Tax matters between any of the Companies or Subsidiaries on the one
hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, none of
the Companies, the Subsidiaries, the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers
shall have any further rights or liabilities pursuant to any such agreement or
arrangement for any past or future period.

           9.7 Carrybacks. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Companies
and Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, waive
the right to carryback any income Tax losses, credits or similar items
attributable to the Companies and Subsidiaries from a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date to a taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date.

9.8      338 Elections.

           (a) Section 338(g) Election. The Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser
may make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and any corresponding or
similar elections under state, local or foreign tax law with respect to any of
the Companies and Subsidiaries that is not a U.S. corporation. Purchaser shall
provide the Sellers with notice of any such election as required by the Treasury
Regulations under Section 338 of the Code.

           (b) Section 338(h)(10) Election.

               (i) CSG shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to (as the case may
          be), join with Purchaser in making an election under Section
          338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and any
          corresponding or similar elections under state, local or foreign tax
          law (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to
          any of the Companies and Subsidiaries that is a U.S. corporation.

               (ii) Subject to this Section 9.8, Purchaser shall be responsible
          for the preparation and filing of all forms and documents required in
          connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election . In addition to the
          Form 8023, the Sellers shall execute (or cause to be executed) and
          deliver to Purchaser such additional documents or forms as are
          reasonably requested to complete properly the Section 338(h)(10)
          Election at least 30 days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10)
          Election is required to be filed.

               (iii) Purchaser and the Sellers shall file, and shall cause their
          Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and statements, forms and
          schedules in connection therewith in a manner consistent with the
          Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary
          thereto unless required to do so by applicable Law.

               (iv) The parties agree that they shall retain Standard & Poor's
          Corporate Value Consulting (at the expense of Purchaser except that
          $25,000 of such expenses shall be paid by the Sellers) to (A) allocate
          the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
          purchase price among the Companies and Subsidiaries based on the fair
          market value of their respective assets and liabilities and (B)
          provide a separate fair market valuation of the Business Intellectual
          Property owned by the Companies and Subsidiaries. Purchaser and the
          Sellers shall allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with Standard
          & Poor's Corporate Value Consulting's determinations and all Tax
          Returns and reports filed by Purchaser, the Sellers, and their
          respective Affiliates (including, but not limited to, Tax Returns
          required by Treasury Regulations promulgated under Sections 338 and
          1060 of the Code) shall be prepared consistently with such allocation.


                                       75
<PAGE>
           9.9 Transfer Taxes. All documentary, sales, use, value added,
transfer, stamp and similar Taxes, fees or governmental charges as levied by any
Governmental Body (including any interest and penalties) in connection with the
purchase and sale of stock or assets contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne and paid equally by Purchaser and the Seller. Purchaser will file all
necessary Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, fees or governmental charges,
and, if required by applicable law, the Sellers will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns. The Sellers and
Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable efforts to obtain
any available mitigation, reduction or exemption for any such Taxes, fees or
governmental charges.

           9.10 Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered by Article IX
shall be resolved by the Arbiter. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be
borne one-half by the Sellers and one-half by Purchaser. If any dispute with
respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date (including all
available extensions) of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct;
provided, however, that if the Arbiter subsequently determines that the other
party's position with respect to the dispute is correct, such other party's
indemnification obligation with respect to such Tax Return pursuant to Section
9.1 or 9.2, as the case may be, shall not exceed the amount such other party
would have had to pay with respect to such Tax Return pursuant to Section 9.1 or
9.2, as the case may be, if such Tax Return had been prepared in the manner
proposed by such other party. If, as a result of the previous sentence, such
other party has paid an amount in excess of its indemnification obligation, the
party responsible for filing such Tax Return shall promptly pay to the other
party the amount of such excess.

           9.11 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Sellers and Purchaser agree
to treat any indemnity payments made pursuant to Articles VIII and IX as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all income tax purposes. If,
notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding sentence, any
indemnification payment under Article VIII or Article IX is finally determined
to be taxable to the party receiving such payment by any Taxing Authority, the
indemnifying party shall pay an amount that reflects the hypothetical Tax
consequences of the receipt of accrual of such payment , using the maximum
statutory rate (or rates, in the case of an item that affects more than one tax)
applicable to the recipient of such payment for the relevant year, reflecting
for example, the effect of deductions available for interest paid or accrued and
for Taxes such as state and local income Taxes.

           9.12 Time Limits. Any claim for indemnity under this Article IX may
be made at any time prior to thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
applicable Tax statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable
period (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive).


                                       76
<PAGE>
           9.13 Exclusivity. Except to the extent provided in Section 8.4(f),
the indemnification provided for in this Article IX shall be the sole remedy for
any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising out of or relating to
a breach of Section 4.15. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Article IX, on the one hand, and the provisions of Article VIII, on the
other, the provisions of this Article IX shall control.

           9.14 Purchaser Covenants. Without the consent of the Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, Purchaser covenants that it will not
cause or permit the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of Purchaser
(i) other than as contemplated by this Agreement, to take any action on the
Closing Date other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, including but not
limited to the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any
redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax asset of
the Sellers or their Affiliates or give rise to any loss of the Sellers or their
Affiliates under this Agreement, or (ii) except as required by Law, to amend any
Tax Return that includes all or any portion of a Pre-Closing Taxable Period,
take any position on any Tax Return, or enter into any agreement with any Taxing
Authority, that results in an increased Tax Liability of the Sellers or their
Affiliates (or a reduction of any Tax asset that would have otherwise been
retained by the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Companies and
Subsidiaries)) in respect of a Pre-Closing Taxable Period.

           9.15 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause
to be paid to the Sellers all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by
Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, any Company or any Subsidiary
attributable to Taxes paid by the Sellers, any Company or any Subsidiary (or any
predecessor or Affiliate of the Seller) with respect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, except to the extent that
such refunds are reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital. If, in
lieu of receiving any such refund, any Company or Subsidiary reduces a Tax
liability with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date, or increases a Tax asset that can be carried forward to
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers the amount of
such reduction in Tax liability or the amount of any benefit resulting from such
increase in Tax assets, as the case may be.

           9.16 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Purchaser and the Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Companies and Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of any return (including any report required pursuant to Section
6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), for the
preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit
or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Purchaser and the Sellers
agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the
Companies and the Subsidiaries until the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired,
and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority. Each Company agrees to give the Sellers


                                       77
<PAGE>
reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books
and records relating to Tax matters and, if the Sellers so request, the Company
shall allow the Sellers to take possession of such books and records. Purchaser
and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or
other proceedings involving the Company for any Tax purposes and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary
to carry out the intent of this subsection.


                                    ARTICLE X

                                   TERMINATION

           10.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior
to the Closing as follows:

           (a) At the election of the Sellers or Purchaser on or after January
31, 2006 (such date, as it may be extended, the "Termination Date"), if the
Closing shall not have occurred by the close of business on such date, provided
that the terminating party is not in material default of any of its obligations
hereunder.

           (b) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and Purchaser;

           (c) by the Sellers or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final
nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being agreed that, subject to the last
sentence of Section 6.4(b) hereof, the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination which is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available to a party if such
Order was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

           (d) by Purchaser if the Sellers or any Company shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of
the Sellers or any Company shall have become untrue, in either case such that
the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and
such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Sellers of
notice of such breach from Purchaser; or

           (e) by the Sellers if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days following receipt by Purchaser of notice of such breach from
the Seller.

<PAGE>
           10.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination and
abandonment by Purchaser or the Seller, or both, pursuant to Section 10.1,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the purchase of the Securities hereunder
shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser, the Companies or the
Seller.

           10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall be
relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination shall be without Liability to
Purchaser, the Sellers or any Company; provided, however, that the obligations
of the parties set forth in this Section 10.3, Article XI, Section 6.6(b) and
Section 6.8 hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable
hereunder; provided further, however, that nothing in this Section 10.3 shall
relieve Purchaser, the Sellers or any Company of any Liability for a breach of
this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

           11.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, it being understood that in no
event shall the Companies or Subsidiaries bear any of such costs and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and Purchaser shall each be
responsible for one-half of the filing fees lawfully payable to or at the
request of any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement.

           11.2 Specific Performance. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that a
breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to Purchaser and that
Purchaser will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the obligations of
the Sellers under this Agreement, including the Sellers' obligation to sell the
Securities to Purchaser, shall be enforceable by a decree of specific
performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate
injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such
remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or
otherwise.

           11.3 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury Trial.

           (a) The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State of New York
over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action proceeding related


                                       79
<PAGE>
thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the
maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment
in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

           (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being
served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.

           (c) THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

           11.4 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Seller Documents, the
Purchaser Documents and the Side Letter represent the entire understanding and
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement
signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such
right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by
law.

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
