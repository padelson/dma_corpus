been afforded the full opportunity to review all information provided to
it by Seller and the Company and has had the opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers to its satisfaction from Seller and the Company

any officers, agents or shareholders of any other Party regardless of whether

practical consult the Buyer on any material operational matter relating to
any of the Material Contracts or Vendor Agreements and no action or step
shall be taken or be omitted to be taken without the Buyers prior written

failing which it shall be deemed to have consented.

Buyers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). The Seller
agrees that it shall fund and/or cause the Company to pay in a timely fashion
in accordance with the terms of each of the Construction Contracts any
further instalments that fall due to the Builder thereunder in the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date or Cancellation Date
(as the case may be); provided, however, that the Cash Payment referred to in
Section 2.2(a) hereof shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(d) hereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, any instalments paid to the Builder prior to the
date of this Agreement (which the Parties acknowledge amount in aggregate to
USD [TBA]) shall not be reimbursed.

  

Subject to satisfaction of the relevant conditions for Closing, the Buyer
shall reimburse direct or cause the Company to reimburse to the Seller upon
the Closing Date the reasonable costs of the supervision of construction of
the Rigs incurred by the Company or Seller in the period between the date of

Affiliate shall negotiate or enter into any agreement or understanding with

representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if the
Seller or the Company becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this
Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such

        

representation or warranty had such representation or warranty been made as
of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition. The Buyer
agrees to notify the Seller if prior to the Closing in the course of
due diligence it becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of the Sellers representation and warranties hereunder.

Except as otherwise expressly contemplated herein, no Receiving Party or its
representatives shall use any Confidential Information for any purpose other

disclose to any third party the existence of this Agreement, the subject
matter or terms hereof or any Confidential Information concerning the
business or affairs of any Disclosing Party without the prior written consent
of such Disclosing Party.

  

In the event that a Receiving Party or its representatives is requested
pursuant to, or required by, applicable Law, regulation, stock exchange rules
or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information concerning the
business or affairs of a Disclosing Party, then such Receiving Party or its
representatives, as the case may be, will promptly notify such Disclosing
Party. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer may disclose such
information, including terms and conditions, from or relating to this
Agreement and the Material Contracts as it sees fit in connection
with seeking Stockholder Approval and financing.

amount of $263,960,000 and thereafter increased by any earned and accrued
interest thereon and decreased by any applicable state or federal taxes

Trust Assets are to be held for the benefit of Buyers stockholders
and either distributed as part of the consummation of a business
combination between Buyer and a business entity or entities meeting certain
requirements or returned to Buyers stockholders.

  

Seller and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, Seller and the Company do not now have, and
shall not at any time prior to the Closing have, any claim to, or make any
claim against, the Trust Account, regardless of whether such claim arises as
a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the business
relationship between Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other matter,
and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity
or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to as the "Claims"). Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, Seller and the Company hereby irrevocably waive
any Claim they may have, now or in the future (in each case, however, prior

with the laws of New York and any dispute arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement shall be referred first to mediation as provided in
Clause 9.7 below. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through
mediation, the dispute shall be referred to arbitration in New York in
accordance with Clause 9.8 below.

  

 **9.7** ** **Mediation

  

In the event of a dispute between the Parties, either Party may at any time
elect to refer the dispute to mediation by service on the other party of a
written notice (the "Mediation Notice") calling on the other party to resolve
the dispute through mediation.

  

Upon receipt the Mediation Notice, the Parties, acting in good faith, shall
agree on a mediator within 14 calendar days of receipt of the Mediation
Notice, failing which on the application of either party a mediator will be
appointed promptly by the President/Chief Executive Officer of JAMS or any
person that the President/Chief Executive Officer may designate for that
purpose. The mediation shall be conducted in such place and in accordance
with such procedure and on such terms as the parties may agree, or in the
event of disagreement, as may be set by the mediator.

  

The mediation shall not affect the rights of either Party to seek such relief
or take such steps as is considered necessary to protect its interest.

  

Unless otherwise agreed or specified in the mediation terms, each party shall
bear its own costs incurred in the mediation and the parties shall share
equally the mediators costs and expenses.

  

The mediation process shall be without prejudice and confidential and no
information or documents disclosed during it shall be revealed to the
Arbitration Tribunal except to the extent that they are disclosable under the
law and procedure governing the arbitration.

  

 **9.8** ** **Arbitration

  

The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the United National
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Terms current at the time
when the arbitration proceedings are commenced. The reference shall be to
three arbitrators. A party wishing to refer a dispute to arbitration shall
appoint its arbitrator and send notice of such appointment in writing to the
other party requiring the other party to appoint its arbitrator within 14
calendar days of that notice and stating that it will appoint its arbitrator
as sole arbitrator unless the other party appoints its own arbitrator and
give notice that it has done so within the 14 days specified. If the other
party does not appoint its own arbitrator and give notice that it has done so
within the 14 days specified, the party referring a dispute to arbitration
may, without the requirement of any further prior notice to the other party,
appoint its arbitrator as sole arbitrator and shall advise the party
accordingly. The award of a sole arbitrator shall be binding on both parties
as if he had been appointed by agreement.

  

Nothing herein shall prevent the parties agreeing in writing to vary these
provisions to provide for the appointment of a sole arbitrator.

        

 **9.9** ** **Severability

  

If any term or any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to the
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

assigns, and rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities, except for the

delivered pursuant hereto, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to
