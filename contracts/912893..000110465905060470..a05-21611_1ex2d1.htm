## SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as Paying Agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the cash payment in accordance with this Article
II of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration (such cash being referred
to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent the Payment Fund for the benefit of the holders
of Shares (other than the Excluded Shares). The Paying Agent shall make
payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration out of the Payment
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of Merger.  The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest
earned on cash deposited in the Payment Fund shall be paid to the Surviving
REIT.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Share Transfer Books_.  On the Closing Date, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Shares. From and after the Closing Date,
the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Closing Date, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving REIT or the
transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly evidenced thereby.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Exchange Procedures_.  Promptly following the Closing Date (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days), the Surviving REIT shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced
outstanding Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive or
be exchanged for Company Common Cash Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass
to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to
the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares previously evidenced by such Certificate pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Closing Date to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares, Company Share Options
or Company RSEs_. On the Closing Date, holders of Shares shall cease to be,
and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration provided under this
Article II. The Company Common Share Merger Consideration paid or delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
Shares, exchanged therefor. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect
to Company Share Options in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
and privileges pertaining to the canceled Company Share Options and on and
after the Effective Time the holders of Company Share Options shall have no
further rights with respect to any Company Share Option, other than the right
to receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(f). The
RSE Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company RSEs in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the canceled Company
RSEs and on and after the Effective Time the holders of Company RSEs shall
have no further rights with respect to any Company RSE, other than the right
to receive the RSE Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(g).

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six (6) months
after the Closing Date, shall be delivered to the Surviving REIT and any
holders of Shares prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving REIT and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration.

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

### (f) _No Liability_. None of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving REIT,
the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, trustee,
agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or RSE
Merger Consideration, as applicable, from the Payment Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Investment of Payment Fund_.  The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Payment Fund, as directed by the Surviving REIT, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving REIT. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion
of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting of a bond to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying
Agent, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 2.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving REIT or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Shares, Company Share Options or Company RSEs such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code (as defined herein), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving REIT or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Share
Options or Company RSEs in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving REIT or the Paying Agent, as applicable. Any
amounts deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted by the Surviving REIT or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, to the appropriate Governmental Entity on a
timely basis.

that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Common Shares issued and outstanding shall,
through a reorganization,

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other similar change in the capitalization of the Company

_however_ , that nothing set forth in this Section 2.5 shall be construed to
supersede or in any way limit the prohibitions set forth in Section

Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the

will be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which its relevance is reasonably apparent from the face of
the disclosure), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

  



  

## SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries and Other
Interests_.

  



  

### (a)  The Company is a real estate investment trust duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland. The
Company Declaration of Trust, as amended and supplemented through the date
hereof, is in effect and no dissolution, revocation or forfeiture proceedings
regarding the Company have been commenced. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing under the
laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has all requisite real estate investment trust power and
authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its
business as now conducted in all material respects. The term " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, condition, circumstance or
effect that (x) is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the
assets, business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (y) has the effect of
preventing or materially impairing or delaying the ability of the Company to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each
case, other than changes, conditions, circumstances or effects that are the
result of (i) economic factors affecting the economy or financial markets as
a whole or generally affecting any of the industries and markets in which the

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries operates, (ii) natural disasters,
acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, military actions or the escalation
thereof that do not result in the destruction of or material physical damage
to a material portion of the properties of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) any change in applicable laws, rules or
regulations or accounting rules, (iv) that arise out of or result from
actions taken by the parties in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or (v) a
change in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Shares
(provided that a change in the market price or trading volume of the Company
Common Shares may be used, as applicable, as evidence that some other effect,
condition, circumstance or change has had a Company Material Adverse Effect),
except that the exclusions set forth in clause (i) shall only be effective if
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not disproportionately impacted
by such events when compared to other companies in the industries and markets
in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate).

jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has the
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority, as the case may be, to own its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each Company Subsidiary and Material JV is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification or licensure, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Company Subsidiary_ " means any Subsidiary of the Company (but
not including any Material JV); " _Material JV_ " means Rochelle Development
Joint Venture, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; and " _Material
Company Subsidiary_ " means a Company Subsidiary that constitutes a

Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding equity or voting securities or
other interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries and all of the

### (c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the holders of the Company Common Shares (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder
Approval, regardless of whether the Company Board has approved, endorsed or
recommended another Acquisition Proposal or has withdrawn, modified or
amended the Company Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to such holders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that they give the
Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), except to
the extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its
adoption of this Agreement and its recommendation in the Proxy Statement, as
permitted by and determined in accordance with Section 6.4(c). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the holders of Company Common Shares sufficiently in advance of a
vote on this Agreement and the Merger to ensure that such vote occurs on the
basis of full and complete information as required under applicable Law.

  

### 

  

SECTION 6.2 _Other Filings_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each
shall properly prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange
Act or any other federal, state or foreign law relating to the Merger
(including filings, if any, required under the HSR Act) (collectively, the "
_Other Filings_ "). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly notify the other of the receipt of any comments on, or any request
for amendments or supplements to, any of the Other Filings by the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity or official, and each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
it and each of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
members of its staff or any other appropriate governmental official, on the
other hand, with respect to any of the Other Filings. The Company, Parent and
Merger Sub each shall promptly obtain and furnish the other (a) the
information which may be reasonably required in order to make such Other
Filings and (b) any additional information which may be requested by a
Governmental Entity and which the parties reasonably deem appropriate.

  



  

SECTION 6.3 _Additional Agreements_. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, but subject to the obligation to act in good faith, and
subject at all times to the Companys and its trustees right and duty to act
in a manner consistent with their duties under applicable Law, each of

40   

     
   

  



  

## use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Merger and to cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing,
including the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any necessary
consents, approvals, orders, exemptions and authorizations by or from any
public or private Third Party, including, without limitation, any that
are required to be obtained under any federal, state or local law or
regulation or any contract, agreement or instrument to which the Company is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound, to
defend all lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger, to effect all necessary registrations and
Other Filings and submissions of information requested by a Governmental
Entity, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger.

  



  

SECTION 6.4 _No Solicitations_.

  



  

### (a) The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and
its and their respective officers, trustees, employees and Representatives
to, immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations
with any Person that has made or indicated an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly request that each Person who
has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company in connection with
that Persons consideration of an Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all
non-public information furnished to that Person by or on behalf of the
Company. The Company will promptly inform its Representatives of the
Companys obligations under this Section 6.4 and will instruct its
Representatives to notify the Company as promptly as practicable following
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (b) Except as specifically permitted in this Section 6.4, the Company
shall not, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, trustees or employees or any Representative retained by any of them
not to, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including
by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 9.2), or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) initiate, participate in or knowingly encourage
any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
,  _however_ , that, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval,
if the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal or a proposal that
may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement or that did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 6.4, the Company may furnish, or cause to be
furnished, non-public information with respect to the Company to the Person
who made such proposal (provided that the Company concurrently discloses the
same such non-public information to Parent if such non-public information has
not previously been disclosed to Parent) and may participate in discussions
and negotiations regarding such proposal if (A) the Company Board, or any
committee thereof to which the power to consider such matters has been
delegated, determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that failure

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

### to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its duties to
the Company or its shareholders under applicable Law and (B) prior to taking
such action, the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with respect
to such proposal that contains provisions no less restrictive than
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.6 hereof). The Company
shall promptly, and in any event within 48 hours, notify Parent after receipt
by the Company of (x) any Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms
and conditions thereof, to the extent known, the identity of the Third Party
making any proposal and any material change in the status of discussions or
negotiations (including any material amendments to the proposal) between the
Company and the Person making such proposal (y) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal, or (z) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not, and
will cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing information to Parent required to be provided to
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.4(b). The Company will not, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Recommendation, or if applicable, the approval or recommendation of
any committee of the Company Board, of the Merger, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal to holders of the Company Common Shares, (iii) authorize, permit or
cause the Company to enter into any definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e), if, but only if, each of the following has occurred, in each such
case, in respect of a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 9.2): (A) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its duties to the Company or its shareholders under
applicable Law, (B) the Company has provided Parent with written notice of
its intention to take any such action, (C) the Company has given Parent three
(3) Business Days after delivery of such notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and has negotiated in good
faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal,
if any, and (D) following the three (3) Business Day period referred to in
(C), such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board
has again made the determination described in clause (A) above. In the event
that the Company Board complies with its obligations in the preceding
sentence, the Company may enter into a definitive agreement to effect a
Superior Proposal, but not prior to such time as the Company has provided
Parent with written notice that the Company has elected to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and otherwise complied with the
Companys obligations in the preceding sentence and in Section 8.1(e).

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

### (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company
from at any time taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided, however,_
that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act will be deemed to be a withdrawal, modification or amendment of the
Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or the Merger Sub unless
the Company Board (x) expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the
Companys shareholders in favor of the Merger, (y) rejects such other
Acquisition Proposal, or (z) does not otherwise comment on the merits
(relative or otherwise) of the Acquisition Proposal or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.5 _Officers , Directors and Trustees Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation in which any Person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, a director, officer, employee, trustee, fiduciary or agent of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party or witness based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or
she is or was an officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as an, officer, director, trustee, employee, fiduciary
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in
connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising at or before or after the
Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and
agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the
Closing Date, the Surviving REIT shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising at or before or after the Closing
Date), (A) the Company and, after the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT shall
promptly pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to
indemnification, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain a single counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Company and the Surviving REIT shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
within thirty (30) days

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

### after statements therefor are received, and (C) the Company and, after
the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT will use its reasonable best efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Surviving REIT shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and provided further
that the Company and the Surviving REIT shall have no obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final
and non-appealable, that indemnification by such entities of such Indemnified
Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.5,
upon learning of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Closing Date, the Surviving REIT thereof; provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company and the Surviving REIT
except to the extent, if any, such failure to promptly notify materially
prejudices such party.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
Indemnified Party provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other
applicable organizational documents) of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date and, at the Closing Date, shall become the obligation
of the Surviving REIT; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a " _Claim_ ") asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Claim.

  

### 

  

### (c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase a non-
cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing
directors, trustees and officers liability insurance coverage for the
Companys directors, officers and trustees in the same form as presently
maintained by the Company, with the same or comparably rated insurers as the
Companys current insurer, which shall provide such directors, officers and
trustees with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date of not
less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not less
favorable in the aggregate to, the insured persons than the directors,
trustees and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no event will the Surviving REIT be
required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving REIT will obtain that amount of
directors, trustees and officers insurance (or " _tail_ " coverage)
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.  Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving REIT to, maintain such policies in full
force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.5
applies without the consent of each such affected indemnitee. This Section
6.5 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third
party beneficiary rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and shall be binding on all successors of the Surviving REIT. Each of
the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions of this Section 6.5.

  

### 

  

### (e) In the event that, following the Closing Date, the Surviving REIT or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
or (iii) commences a dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or similar action, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving REIT, as
the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

  

### 

  

SECTION 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Material JVs (to the extent
possible) and each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors,
officers, employees and agents to and, to the extent reasonably possible, the
directors, officers, employees and agents of its Material JVs to afford to
Parent and to the directors, officers, employees, and agents of Parent
reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours without undue interruption (and will request the same from the
Companys, its Subsidiaries and Material JVs (to the extent reasonably
possible) auditors, attorneys, financial advisors and lenders) to (a) the
properties, books, records and contracts of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and (b) the officers and employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries;
_provided, however,_ that Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to a schedule of properties to be
visited and officers and employees to be accessed prior to any such visits or
access. The Company shall furnish Parent such financial, operating and other
data and information as Parent may reasonably request.

  

### 

  

### (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in that certain confidentiality agreement between Parent and the
Company dated June 30, 2005, as supplemented on October 20, 2005 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

### 

  

SECTION 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, however,_ that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

## such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law
or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the
party issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its
commercially reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to
obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.
In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the
Merger contemplated hereby no later than the opening of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange on the Business Day following the date on which this
Agreement is signed.

  



  

SECTION 6.8 _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

  



  

### (a) After the Closing Date, all employees of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") who are employed by the
Surviving REIT, shall continue to be eligible to participate in any benefit
plan, program or arrangement (including any " _employee benefit plan_ ", as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA or any vacation program) (an " _Employee
Benefit Plan_ "), of the Company which is continued by the Surviving REIT, or
alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as other
similarly situated employees of the Surviving REIT or its Subsidiaries in a
similar Employee Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained by the Surviving REIT
or in which employees of the Surviving REIT or its Subsidiaries participate
after the Closing Date. With respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan of
the Surviving REIT, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
the predecessor of any of them shall be included for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting (if applicable) and determination of the
level of entitlement to benefits under such Employee Benefit Plan (but not
**** for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree
medical or other welfare or as would otherwise result in a duplication of
benefits). The Surviving REIT shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to all Company Employees under any comparable welfare
plan that such Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Closing Date under any comparable welfare plan maintained by the Company
for such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide
each such Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Closing Date for the plan year within which the Closing
Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (b) At and after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving REIT
to honor in accordance with their terms the employment agreements, severance
agreements, and other bonus and severance obligations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries listed in Section 6.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, except to the extent otherwise agreed to between the employee party
thereto and the Surviving REIT.

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

### (c) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee, director, trustee or
consultant (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment or
services or resumed employment or resumed services. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing herein precludes
the Surviving REIT from terminating the employment of any employee for any
reason for which the Company could have terminated such employee prior to
the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving REIT to amend, reform or supplement
the terms of any nonqualified deferred compensation plan (within the meaning
of Code Section 409A and related guidance) covering any Company Employee as
necessary for compliance with, or to avoid adverse tax consequence under,
Section 409A, while preserving to the extent practicable the intended
treatment of the original plan.

  

### 

  

### (e) Nothing in this Section 6.8 will prohibit Parent or the Surviving
REIT from amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Program pursuant
to, and in accordance with, its terms.

  

### 

  

SECTION 6.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) The Company and its Tax Subsidiaries will take all actions, and
refrain from taking all actions, as are necessary to ensure that the Company
will qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for
its current taxable year and the period up through the Closing. During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, the Company will
facilitate all reasonable requests of Parent with respect to maintenance of
the Companys REIT status for the Companys 2005 taxable year and 2006
taxable year.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any Tax
Subsidiary to, change in any material respect any of its methods of reporting
income or deductions for federal income Tax purposes from those employed in
the preparation of its federal income Tax return for the taxable year ending
December 31, 2005, except as required by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each Tax Subsidiary required
to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, including applicable extensions
(including timely filing of Tax Returns for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2005). Any such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with
the historic Tax accounting practices of the Company (except as may be
required under applicable Tax Law). The Company will pay all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns. The Company will provide to Parent copies of such
Tax Returns that are to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns (including
applicable extensions) and the Company will accept any and all reasonable
comments of Parent with respect to such Tax Returns.

reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion described in Section 7.2(c)
dated as of the Closing Date.

  



  

SECTION 6.11 _Interim Period Dividends_. With the exception of dividends
contemplated in Section 5.1 of this Agreement or dividends reasonably
determined by the Company to be required to be distributed in order for the
Company to qualify as a REIT for the 2005 taxable year, the Company shall not
declare a dividend in an amount exceeding the minimum dividend necessary to
avoid the imposition of excise tax under Section 4981 of the Code for the
2005 taxable year.

  



  

SECTION 6.12 _Net Worth_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not
declare or pay any distribution on its equity interests or enter into any
transaction with any of its owners which, in any such case, would reduce
Parents net worth below $400 million.

### (a) _Representations and Warranties_. Each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true
and correct (determined without regard to any materiality or material adverse
effect qualification contained in any representation or warranty) at and as
of the Closing Date,

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

### as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent a representation
or warranty is made as of a time other than the Closing Date, in which case
such representation or warranty shall be true and correct at and as of such
time), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub,
dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects with
all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however,_
that each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not be deemed to have failed to so
perform or comply with such agreements or covenants if it cures such non-
performance or non-compliance within a reasonable period of time (not to
exceed five (5) Business Days of the occurrence of such event). The Company
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

  

### 

  

SECTION 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No party may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in this Article VII to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to use its own commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereunder.

SECTION 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Closing Date, whether before or, other than as provided

### (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

  

### 

  

### (b) by either of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub,

#### 

  

#### (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree, judgment, injunction or taken any other action
(which order, decree, judgment, injunction or other action the parties hereto
shall have used their reasonable best efforts to lift), which permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation
of the Merger, and such order, decree, judgment, injunction or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable, _provided, however,_ that the
party terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii)

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

#### shall have used reasonable best efforts to have such offer, decree,

before May 31, 2006 (the " _Drop Dead Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall
not be available to either party if such partys failure to comply with any
provision of this Agreement in a material respect has been the proximate
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the
Drop Dead Date.

  

#### 

  

### (c) by written notice from Parent to the Company, if the Company
breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), and such condition is incapable of
being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date or such breach has not been cured by
the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Companys receipt of
written notice of such breach from Parent;

  

### 

  

### (d) by written notice from the Company to Parent if Parent or Merger Sub
breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and such condition is incapable of
being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date or such breach has not been cured by
Parent or Merger Sub within fifteen (15) Business Days after Parents receipt
of written notice of such breach from the Company;

  

### 

  

### (e) by written notice from the Company to Parent, in connection with
entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 6.4;  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the Company shall
have complied with all of its obligations under Section 6.4(c) and paid to
Parent the Break-up Fee as provided in Section 8.2(b) and expenses of Parent
(to the extent the Company has received documentation thereof);

  

### 

  

### (f) by written notice of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, if the
Company Board shall (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (B) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (C) approve any Acquisition Proposal
or recommend that the holders of the Company Common Shares accept or approve
any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve or announce its intention to do any of
the foregoing; or

  

### 

  

### (g) by written notice of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, if the
Company shall fail to obtain the opinion of counsel described in Section
7.2(c) hereof.

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 8.2 and to Section 8.3, in

Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without
any liability on the part of

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

### Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and each of their respective directors,
trustees, officers, employees, partners, stockholders or shareholders and all
rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for the
agreements contained in Sections 6.6 (Confidentiality), 6.7 (Public
Announcements), 8.2 (Effect of Termination), 8.3 (Fees and Expenses) and
Article IX (General Provisions); _provided, however_ , that nothing contained
in this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages
arising out of any fraud or willful breach by such party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(e), or by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the
Company shall pay to Parent an amount in cash equal to $40.0 million (the "
_Break-Up Fee_ "), and reimburse Parent for its expenses pursuant to Section
8.3. In addition, if (A) prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly made (and not withdrawn at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), or prior to the
breach that gave rise to such termination, in the case of a termination

or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(c) at a time when the Company Shareholder Approval has not been obtained,
and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12)
months of such termination (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was the
first Acquisition Proposal referred to above), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Break-Up Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any fees
or expenses paid to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(c) shall not be deducted
from the payment of any Break-Up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b). Payment
of the Break-Up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b) shall be payable by the
Company to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the
case of termination of this Agreement by the Company under Section 8.1(e),
concurrently with the effective date of such termination, (ii) in the case of
termination of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub under Section 8.1(f),
within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination, or (iii) in
case of a situation contemplated by the second sentence of this Section
8.2(b), on the same Business Day as the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f),
Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee
is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the payment of the Break-Up Fee
shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or
any other claim which Parent or Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to
assert against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets, or against any of their respective trustees, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members or shareholders, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub, except for the
recovery of costs and expenses pursuant to Section 8.3(c).  The parties
hereto

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

### expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of
accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f),
Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c), in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee
is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the rights to payment under
Section 8.2(b): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will
be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f), Section 8.1(b)(i) or
Section 8.1(c), and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any
and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing. Except for nonpayment
of the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) or 8.3, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f), Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(c),
in circumstances where the Break-Up Fee is payable in accordance with Section
8.2(b), in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub, (i) seek to obtain any
recovery or judgment against the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries, or any
of their respective assets, or against any of their respective trustees,
officers, employees, partners, managers, members or shareholders, or (ii) be
entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without
limitation, consequential, indirect or punitive damages.

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except as set forth in Sections 8.3(b), 8.3(c) and 8.2, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all

### (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d), Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days after

expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
lawyers, accountants, financial advisors and investment bankers, incurred by
the Company in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the
carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder, provided that such
fees and expenses to be paid by Parent hereunder shall not exceed $5.0
million.

  

### 

  

### (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(e), Section 8.1(f), or Section 8.1(g)
the Company shall pay to Parent within three (3) Business Days after the
date of termination, in addition to any amounts payable pursuant to Section
8.2(b), all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers,
lenders, accountants, financial advisors and investment bankers, incurred by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the entering into of this Agreement
and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder, provided
that the amount of such fees and expenses to be paid by the Company hereunder
shall not exceed $5.0 million. As provided in Section 8.2(b), the amount of
any fees or expenses paid to

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

### Parent pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) shall not be deducted from the
payment of any Break-Up Fee required by Section 8.2(b).

  

### 

  

### (d) If either party fails to pay to the other party any amounts due
under Section 8.2 or 8.3, the party so failing shall pay (i) the reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including, without limitation, the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment and
(ii) interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period, as published in the Wall Street Journal, from the date
such amounts were due until the date received by the receiving party.  The
payment of expenses set forth herein is not an exclusive remedy, but is in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to the parties
hereto (whether at law or in equity).

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.4 _Payment of Amount or Expense_.

  

## 

  

### (a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent the Break-
Up Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or the Company or Parent is obligated to
pay the other the expenses set forth in Section 8.3 (collectively, the "
_Section 8.2 Amount_"), the Company or Parent (the " _Payor_ ") shall pay to
the other party (the " _Payee_ ") from the applicable Section 8.2 Amount
deposited into escrow, if any, in accordance with the next sentence, an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Section 8.2 Amount and (ii) the sum of
(1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Payee without causing the
Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or 856(c)(3)(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), as determined by the Payees independent certified public
accountants, plus (2) in the event the Payee receives either (x) a letter
from the Payees counsel indicating that the Payee has received a ruling from
the IRS described in Section 8.4(b)(ii) or (y) an opinion from the Payees
outside counsel as described in Section 8.4(b)(ii), an amount equal to the
Section 8.2 Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To
secure the Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Payor shall deposit
into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section 8.2 Amount with an
escrow agent selected by the Payor and on such terms (subject to Section
8.4(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the
escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Section 8.2 Amount
pursuant to this Section 8.4(a) shall be made at the time the Payor is
obligated to pay the Payee such amount pursuant to Section 8.3 or Section
8.2(b), as applicable, by wire transfer or bank check. In the case of
a payment otherwise required to be made to Parent, the term "Payee" as used

shall include (where appropriate) any direct or indirect equity owner in
Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 8.2 Amount in
escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Payee unless the
escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter
from the Payees independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Payee without
causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

### such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter
from the Payees accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Payee, or (ii) a letter from the
Payees counsel indicating that the Payee received a ruling from the IRS
holding that the receipt by the Payee of the Section 8.2 Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the
Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Payee of the Section 8.2 Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Section 8.2 Amount to the Payee. The Payor
agrees to amend this Section 8.4 at the reasonable request of the Payee in
order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 8.2 Amount that may
be distributed to the Payee hereunder without causing the Payee to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve
the Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section
8.4(b) or (z) assist the Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from
its outside counsel as described in this Section 8.4(b). The escrow agreement
shall also provide that any portion of the Section 8.2 Amount held in escrow
for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Payor.  The
Payor shall not be a party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any
cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at
any time before or after any approval hereof by holders of the Company Common
Shares; _provided, however,_ that after any such approval, no amendment shall
be made which by Law requires further approval by such shareholders without
obtaining such approval.

  



  

SECTION 8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. Except as so waived, no action taken
or omitted to be taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

SECTION 9.4 _Interpretation_. All references in this Agreement and
the Company Disclosure Schedule to Articles, Sections and Exhibits refer
to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the
context requires otherwise. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Wherever used herein, a pronoun in
the masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise and the word "including" shall

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

mean "including without limitation." The phrases "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import will be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement.  The word "or" will be inclusive
and not exclusive unless the context requires otherwise. All references
in this Agreement to any particular Law will be deemed to refer also to any
rules and regulations promulgated under that Law.  References to a Person
also refer to its predecessors and successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

SECTION 9.5 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. Except for Articles I and II, Sections 6.5, 6.8 and 6.9 and any
covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Closing Date (a) none of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing
Date and (b) thereafter there shall be no liability on the part of any of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective officers,
trustees, directors or shareholders in respect thereof. Except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties of
any party hereto, express or implied.

  



  

SECTION 9.6 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt
and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub
under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

SECTION 9.7 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement constitutes, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the Exhibits hereto, the entire agreement and supersedes all of the
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the federal and state courts located in Maryland, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

  



  

SECTION 9.8 _Assignment; Benefit_. Except as expressly permitted by the
terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that the Merger Sub
may assign its rights and interests hereunder, upon three (3) Business Days
prior written notice to the Company, to any entity that is wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, so long as such entitys being a
party to this Agreement will not adversely affect the ability of the Company
to consummate the Merger. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this Section will

  



  

61   

     
   

  



  

be null and void. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary (except for the provisions of Section 6.5 hereof which shall
inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are
expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may
enforce the covenants contained therein), nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors,
executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 9.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be affected
thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable.

  



  

SECTION 9.10 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

## 

  

### (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard
to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland ("
_Maryland Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees
not to plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought
therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is
not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to
appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent
for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be
made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Maryland.

  

### 

  

SECTION 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement
certifies and acknowledges that (a) no Representative of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek
to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action,

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

(b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party
makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.11.

  



  

SECTION 9.12 _Rules of Construction_. The parties to this Agreement have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and waive the application of any Laws or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or other document.

  



  

SECTION 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.  Facsimile transmission of
any signed original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an
original. At the request of any party, the parties will confirm facsimile
transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

  



  

SECTION 9.14 _Incorporation of Recitals, Exhibits and Schedules_.  The
Recitals to this Agreement and all exhibits and schedules referred to in this
Agreement are incorporated herein by such reference and made a part of this
Agreement.

authorized.
