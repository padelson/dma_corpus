AGREEMENT    

 In order to consummate the Merger, and in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I. 
 THE MERGER    

 Section 1.1. Conversion of Company Shares and Options.   

 (a) At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any Option:    

 (i) each share (a "Common Share") of Company Common Stock that is then issued and outstanding (other than shares of Company Common Stock held by Persons who object to the Merger and comply with the provisions of the MBCA concerning the rights of holders of Company Common Stock to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock ("Dissenting Shareholders"), which shares of Dissenting Shareholders will not constitute "Common Shares" hereunder and shall hereafter be referred to as "Dissenting Shares") and each unexercised option to purchase Common Shares that is outstanding and, immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, fully vested (such options being referred to as the "Options") shall thereupon be converted into and become the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to Section 1.1(d) hereof.   

 (b) At the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of Company Common Stock.    ##### 

  

  

 (c) Subject to the adjustments set forth in Sections 1.4 and 1.5 hereof, the "Merger Consideration" shall consist of (i) (A) Three Hundred and Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($325,000,000) in cash, less (B) the Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt, plus (C) the Estimated Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, less (D) the amount of Holder Allocable Expenses paid by Acquiror to the Holder Representative at Closing in accordance with Section 1.6 hereof (the "Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration"); and (ii) eight million (8,000,000) shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the "Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration"), which Acquiror Common Stock shall not have been registered with the SEC as of the Effective Time of the Merger; provided, however, that the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock comprising the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock split, subdivision, stock dividend or recapitalization in respect of the Acquiror Common Stock occurring between the date hereof and the Closing Date. No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror a written statement setting forth (i) the Companys good faith estimate of the Closing Date Funded Debt (the "Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt") and (ii) the Companys good faith estimate of the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents (the "Estimated Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents").   

 (d) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the holders of the Common Shares and the Options as set forth below in this Section 1.1(d).    

 (i) Cash Portion of Merger Consideration. Each holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Common Shares held by such holder, a portion of the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (x) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share, multiplied by (y) the number of Common Shares held by such    ##### 

  

   

holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (but not
including any Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of any Options held by
such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger). Each
holder of Options shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Options
held by such holder, a portion of the Cash Portion of the Merger
Consideration, in respect of the Options held by such holder, equal to (i)
the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share, multiplied by the aggregate number
of Common Shares issuable upon exercise in full of all Options held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, minus (ii)
the aggregate cash exercise price payable upon exercise of all Options
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.
For purposes of the foregoing, the "Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common
Share" shall mean (i) the sum of (A) the Cash Portion of the
Merger Consideration, plus (B) the Aggregate Option Exercise Price, divided
by (ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares. The "Aggregate Fully-
Diluted Common Shares" shall be (i) the aggregate number of Common Shares
held by all holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
plus (ii) the aggregate number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise in
full of all Options held by all holders immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, plus (iii) the aggregate number of Dissenting Shares (if
any); and the "Aggregate Option Exercise Price" shall mean the sum of the
exercise prices payable upon exercise in full of all Options held by all
holders of Options immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger.    

 (ii) Stock Portion of Merger Consideration. Each holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to receive, in respect of the Common Shares held by such holder, a portion of the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration equal to (x) the quotient of (A)    ##### 

  

   

the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration, divided by (B) the Aggregate
Fully-Diluted Common Shares, multiplied by (y) the number of Common Shares
held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
(but not including any Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of any
Options held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger). Each holder of Options shall be entitled to receive a portion of the
Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration, in respect of the Options held
by such holder, equal to (x) the quotient of (A) the Stock Portion of
the Merger Consideration, divided by (B) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted
Common Shares, multiplied by (y) the aggregate number of Common Shares
issuable upon exercise in full of all Options held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.   

 (e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Acquiror. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Common Shares and Options exchanged pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof who, but for the application of the first sentence of this Section 1.1(e), would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to (i) such fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price for a share of Acquirors Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market for the 10 Business Days ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date hereof, as reported by the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street    ##### 

  

  

Journal, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock subdivisions or
combinations and the like (such average closing price for each such share,
the "Closing Stock Price").   

 Section 1.2. Payment and Exchange of Certificates.   

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror will pay to an exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount (the "Funding Amount") equal to (i) the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration, as adjusted in accordance with Section 1.4 hereof and determined prior to giving effect to the adjustments provided for in Section 1.5(c) hereof, minus (ii) the product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares (if any) and (y) the Cash Per Fully-Diluted Common Share. Additionally, Acquiror will issue and deliver to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.2, through such reasonable procedures as Acquiror and the Holder Representative may agree, certificates for the shares of Acquiror Common Stock representing the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) payment by Acquiror to the Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount; (ii) delivery by Acquiror of the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration to the Escrow Agent; (iii) payment of cash by Acquiror to the Exchange Agent in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.1(e); and (iv) payment by Acquiror to the Holder Representative of the estimated Holder Allocable Expenses pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof, Acquiror shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations to make payments in respect of the Merger Consideration other than (A) Acquirors obligation to make payments, if any, required by Section 1.5 hereof and (B) the obligation of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to make payments to Dissenting Shareholders, if any, following the Effective Time of the Merger.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) After the Effective Time of the Merger, each holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates for Common Shares (collectively, the "Certificates") and/or Options, upon surrender of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or, in the case of a holder of Options, upon delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment to the Exchange Agent), shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror (or from the Exchange Agent on Acquirors behalf) in exchange therefor (subject to the provisions of Section 1.5 below) such portion of the Merger Consideration into which such holders Common Shares and/or Options shall have been converted as a result of the Merger; provided, however, that any payment and other consideration with respect to Options held by employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be reduced by the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to the Merger Consideration received by the holders of Options and amounts so withheld shall be paid by the Exchange Agent to the Surviving Corporation for disbursement to the applicable Governmental Authority; and provided, further, (i) a portion of the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to each holder of Common Shares and/or Options equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount multiplied by such holders Applicable Percentage shall be held in escrow in accordance with Section 1.5(d) hereof and the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and (ii) the Acquiror Common Stock issuable to each holder of Common Shares and/or Options as the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration shall be held in escrow in accordance with Section 1.8 hereof and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. Pending such surrender and exchange (or, in the case of a holder of Options, upon such delivery of a Holder Acknowledgment), a holders Certificate or Certificates for Common Shares and/or a holders Holder Acknowledgment with respect to Options shall be deemed for all purposes (other than the exchange contemplated by this Section 1.2) to evidence such holders    ##### 

  

  

portion of the Merger Consideration into which such Common Shares and/or
Options shall have been converted by the Merger.   

 (c) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time of the Merger, Acquiror will instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Acquiror all cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agents duties will terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) and each holder of Options who has not delivered a Holder Acknowledgement may surrender such Certificate or deliver such Holder Acknowledgment to Acquiror and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in consideration therefor, and Acquiror will promptly pay, the aggregate Merger Consideration relating thereto, without any interest thereon.   

 (d) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent or Acquiror, as the case may be, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article I.   

 Section 1.3. Effective Time of the Merger; Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause (i) the Articles of Merger, effective as of the Closing Date, to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota as provided in Section 302A.615 of the MBCA and (ii) the Certificate of Merger, effective as of the Closing Date, to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 and 252 of the DGCL. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Effective Time of the Merger" shall mean the time at which the Articles of Merger have been duly filed in the Office    ##### 

  

  

of the Secretary of State of Minnesota or such later time as may be set forth
in the Articles of Merger; and the term "Closing Date" shall mean the date
that is five (5) Business Days after the date on which all of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 hereof have been satisfied or waived, or such other
date as Acquiror and the Company may mutually agree.   

 Section 1.4. Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital; Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount. Within ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and in no event less than two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth a reasonable estimate of the Net Working Capital of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital"). If (i) the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital minus the Target Net Working Capital Amount (such difference, which may be a positive or negative number, the "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount") is a positive number, then the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration and the Funding Amount will be increased by the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount; provided, however, that the amount of such increase shall not exceed $3,000,000, and (ii) if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Merger Consideration and the Funding Amount will be decreased by the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount; provided, however, that the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration and the Funding Amount shall not be decreased by more than $5,000,000 (the "Initial Cash Reduction") and, if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is negative, any excess of the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount over $5,000,000 shall reduce the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock constituting the Stock    ##### 

  

  

Portion of the Merger Consideration by the number of such shares equal to
such excess divided by the Closing Stock Price.   

 Section 1.5. Adjustments to Merger Consideration.   

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days thereof, the Holder Representative shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror (i) an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet ("Closing Date Net Working Capital"), (iii) a calculation of the aggregate principal amount of all Funded Debt of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, if any, as of the Closing Date as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Date Funded Debt") and (iv) a calculation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing Date as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistent with the preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and shall be prepared using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet and shall fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives access to the records and employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and shall cooperate and cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the employees of the    ##### 

  

  

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Holder
Representative, the accounting firm selected by the Holder Representative to
audit the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Balance Sheet Auditing Firm")
and their representatives in connection with its preparation and audit of the
Closing Balance Sheet, which cooperation shall include executing and delivery
to the Closing Balance Sheet Auditing Firm such management representation
letters and engagement letters as may be requested by the Closing Balance
Sheet Auditing Firm and taking all such reasonable actions necessary to
permit completion of the audit of the Closing Balance Sheet. "Net Working
Capital" as of any date shall mean (i) the consolidated current assets
(excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents) of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of such date, minus (ii) the consolidated current liabilities
(other than the current portion of Funded Debt) of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date, in each case determined in
accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the manner applied
in the preparation of the historical financial statements of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries and prepared using the same accounting methods,
policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in preparation of the
Interim Balance Sheet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for the purpose of determining the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital and Closing Date Net Working Capital, the consolidated
current assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries shall not
reflect the value of the income tax deductions and other tax benefits of the
Company and such Subsidiaries resulting from or arising in connection with (i)
the vesting, conversion, cancellation and/or exercise of all Options pursuant
to the terms hereof or as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any cash bonuses that are paid or
payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of the consummation of
the transactions      ##### 

  

     

contemplated hereby (which shall include the payments to holders of
Options referenced to on Schedule 4.1 hereof), (iii) any fees and expenses
payable by the Company or its consolidated Subsidiaries in connection with or
related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements and fees and
expenses paid to JP Morgan Securities, Inc. or its Affiliates, (iv) deferred
financing costs related to the indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (v) fees and expenses incurred by the Company related to or
in connection with its proposed initial public offering (including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses, road show and printing expenses and
payments made to underwriters) (collectively, the "Closing Tax
Benefits").   

 (b) If Acquiror shall disagree with the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt or the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, or with the conclusions reached by the calculation of such figures, it shall notify the Holder Representative of such disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and such calculations; provided, however, that any such objection shall be limited to any failure on the part of the Holder Representative to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet, or to determine the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt or the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section 1.5. In the event that Acquiror does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Acquiror shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, delivered by the Holder Representative, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely    ##### 

  

  

provided, Acquiror and the Holder Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as they may mutually agree) from the date of delivery of such
notice of disagreement to resolve any disagreements with respect to the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt
or the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents. If, at the end of such period,
they are unable to resolve such disagreements, then Deloitte and Touche USA LLP
(or such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing as
may be mutually selected by Acquiror and the Holder Representative) (the
"Auditor") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall
determine as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30)
days of the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, whether
the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance with the standards set
forth in Section 1.5(a) and (only with respect to the remaining disagreements
submitted to the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt or the Closing Date
Cash and Cash Equivalents requires adjustment. The fees and expenses of the
Auditor shall be paid one-half by Acquiror and one-half by the Holder
Representative as a Holder Allocable Expense pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof.
The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties. The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Closing
Date Funded Debt and the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents are finally
determined in accordance with this Section 1.5(b) is hereinafter referred to
as the "Determination Date."   

 (c) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be a positive or negative number, shall mean the sum of (i) the Net Working Capital True-Up Amount, (ii) the Estimated Closing Date Funded Debt minus the Closing Date Funded Debt and (iii) the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents minus the Estimated Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents. If the Adjustment    ##### 

  

  

Amount is a positive number, then the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration
will be increased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, and if the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount. "Net Working
Capital True-Up Amount", which may be a positive or negative number, means
the Closing Date Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital; provided, however, that, (i) if the Net Working Capital
True-Up Amount is a positive number and the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is a positive number or zero, the Net Working Capital True-
Up Amount will not exceed the excess of $3,000,000 over the Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, (ii) if the Net Working Capital True-Up Amount is
a positive number and the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, the Net Working Capital True-Up Amount will not exceed the
sum of (x) the excess of the Target Net Working Capital Amount over the
Estimated Net Working Capital and (y) $3,000,000, and (iii) if the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital
Amount by more than $3,000,000 and the Closing Date Net Working Capital is
less than the sum of the Target Net Working Capital Amount and
$3,000,000, the Net Working Capital True-Up Amount will equal (x) the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, less (y) the sum of the Target Net Working Capital
Amount and $3,000,000.   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article I, on the Closing Date, $5,000,000 of the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") shall be paid by Acquiror to an escrow agent to be selected by the agreement of Acquiror and the Company prior to Closing (the "Escrow Agent"), to be held in escrow pending determination of the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement in the form    ##### 

  

  

attached hereto as Annex C-1 (the "Adjustment Escrow Agreement"). Upon final
determination of the Adjustment Amount in accordance with Sections 1.5(b) and
(c) hereof, each of Acquiror and Holder Representative shall execute joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Adjustment Escrow Amount as set forth in this Section 1.5(d). If
the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Determination Date, (i) the Escrow Agent shall pay to the holders of the
Common Shares and Options entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (pro
rata, in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages) the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, together with any interest earned thereon, and (ii)
Acquiror shall pay to the holders of Common Shares and Options entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration (pro rata, in accordance with their
respective Applicable Percentages) an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment
Amount, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the prime rate as published in the Eastern Edition of The Wall
Street Journal on the Closing Date. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number and the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is not a negative
number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (i) the Escrow Agent
shall pay to Acquiror out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount an amount equal to
the lesser of (x) the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, together with
interest earned thereon, and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, together with
any interest earned thereon, (ii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall deliver
to Acquiror from the Indemnification Escrow Amount a number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock equal to the amount of such excess, divided by the
Closing Stock Price and (iii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the      ##### 

  

     

Escrow Agent shall pay to the holders of the Common Shares and/or Options
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (pro rata, in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages) the balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, together with any interest earned thereon. If the Adjustment Amount
is a negative number and the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is a
negative number, then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, (i) the Escrow
Agent shall pay to Acquiror out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the lesser
of (x) the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, together with interest
earned thereon, and (y) the Negative Cash Cap, together with interest earned
thereon, and (z) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, together with interest earned
thereon, (ii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds the
amount paid to Acquiror from the Adjustment Escrow Amount in clause (i)
above, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Acquiror from the Indemnification
Escrow Amount a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the amount
of such excess, divided by the Closing Stock Price and (iii) if less than
100% of the Adjustment Escrow Amount is paid to Acquiror pursuant to clause
(i) above, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the holders of Common Shares and/or
Options entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (pro rata in accordance
with their Applicable Percentages) the balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, together with any interest earned thereon. "Negative Cash Cap" means
the excess of (x) the lesser of the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
and $5,000,000 over (y) the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount; provided that, if the foregoing formula would yield a
negative number, the Negative Cash Cap shall be zero. In no event shall the
Holder Representative or any holder of Company Common Stock and/or Options
have any liability under this Section 1.5 in excess of (i) such holders
allocable share of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) such holders
allocable share of any shares of Acquiror      ##### 

  

     

Common Stock distributed from the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to
this Section 1.5(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any distributions to the
holders of Options pursuant to this Section 1.5(d) shall be net of any amount
of taxes required to be withheld from such distributions under applicable
law, and the amounts so withheld shall be paid over to the Surviving
Corporation for payment by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable
Governmental Authority as required by law. In no event shall Acquiror be
entitled to any payment or other amount pursuant to this Section 1.5(d) other
than (i) payments from the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) the receipt of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock from the Indemnification Escrow Amount but
only to the extent provided above in this Section 1.5(d).   

 (e) The parties anticipate that as a result of the Closing Tax Benefits, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to seek a refund of income and franchise Taxes paid for the short taxable year ending on the Closing Date, and in addition will have a net operating loss for such taxable year. Following Closing, Acquiror shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to file claims for refunds of prior income Taxes paid as set forth in Section 12.2(a), and shall pay to the Holder Representative as additional Merger Ponsideration (for distribution by the Holder Representative to the holders of Common Shares and Options on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Applicable Percentages) an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $6,000,000 and (ii) the full amount of any such refunds (together with any interest paid by any Taxing authority on Taxes refunded) received following Closing from time to time, within three (3) business days of receipt of any such refunds.   

 Section 1.6. Holder Allocable Expenses. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Holder Representative will provide to Acquiror an estimate (which estimate may include such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for any Holder Allocable    ##### 

  

  

Expenses that are not then known and determinable) of the following fees and
expenses that may be incurred by the Holder Representative on behalf of the
Company and the holders of the Common Shares and/or Options in connection
with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) the fees and
disbursements of special outside counsel to the Company and/or the Holder
Representative incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) the fees and expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants
and experts employed by the Company and/or the Holder Representative in
connection with the Merger, including but not limited to those of JP Morgan
Securities, Inc., (iii) if necessary, one-half of the fees and expenses of
the Auditor, (iv) the expenses of the Holder Representative incurred in such
capacity, (v) the fees and expenses which Holder Representative is
responsible under the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, and (vi) the fees and disbursements of the Closing Balance
Sheet Auditing Firm and any other expenses relating to the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet (collectively, the "Holder Allocable Expenses"). In no
event will Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Holder Representative
be responsible for payment of Holder Allocable Expenses in excess of the cash
amounts paid to the Holder Representative by Acquiror under this Section 1.6.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and concurrently with
the payment to the Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount in accordance with
Section 1.2(a) hereof, Acquiror shall pay to the Holder Representative by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Holder
Allocable Expenses.   

 Section 1.7. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article I, Dissenting Shareholders who promptly exercise and perfect appraisal rights for Dissenting Shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA shall not    ##### 

  

  

have such Dissenting Shares converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are
granted by Section 302A.473 of the MBCA; provided, however, that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal and payment under the MBCA, the right of such holder to
such appraisal of such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
and such shares shall be deemed to constitute "Common Shares" for all
purposes hereunder and shall be converted as of the Effective Time of the
Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article I. The Company shall give Acquiror (a) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA and received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisals under the
MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Acquiror or as otherwise required by law, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares or offer to
settle, or settle, any such demands.   

 Section 1.8. Indemnification Escrow. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article I to the contrary, on the Closing Date, the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration (the "Indemnification Escrow Amount") shall be delivered by Acquiror to the Escrow Agent, to be held in escrow (i) as security for the indemnification obligations in favor of Acquiror under Article XIII pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement (the "Indemnification Escrow Agreement") to be entered into by and among Acquiror, the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent in a form to be agreed upon between the date hereof and the Closing Date by Acquiror, the Company and the Escrow Agent, which form of agreement shall reflect the terms summarized on Annex C-2 attached hereto, and (ii) to provide security for amount payable to the    ##### 

  

  

Acquiror pursuant to Section 1.5(d) hereof but only to the extent provided in
Section 1.5(d). At any time during the Escrow Period, the Holder
Representative may elect to remove any of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock
from such escrow and replace each such removed share with cash in an amount
equal to the Closing Stock Price for such share. Within five (5) Business
Days of the date that is the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Escrow Termination Date"), each of Acquiror and the Holder Representative
shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse the balance of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
(less the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification asserted in
writing by the Purchaser Indemnitees prior to the Escrow Termination Date
pursuant to Article XIII hereof to the extent not paid or satisfied prior to
the Escrow Termination Date) to the holders of the Common Shares and Options
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (pro rata, in accordance with
their respective Applicable Percentages), together with any earnings thereon
pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

 HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE    

 Section 11.1. Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative. The parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of holders of the Common Shares and Options for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the "Holder Representative"). The parties have designated MPI Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the initial Holder Representative, and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Common Shares shall constitute ratification and approval of such designation. The Holder Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be removed by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than 50% of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares at the Effective Time of the Merger ("Majority Holders"). In the event that a Holder Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder Representative shall be appointed by a vote of Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder Representative.   

 Section 11.2. Authority and Rights of Holder Representative; Limitations on Liability. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are necessary to    ##### 

  

  

carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Holder Representative will have no obligation to act on
behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock and Options, except as
expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Holder Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to
estimate and determine the amounts of Holder Allocable Expenses, and to pay
such Holder Allocable Expenses in accordance with Section 1.6 hereof. The
Holder Representative will have no liability to Acquiror, the Company or the
holders of Common Shares and Options with respect to actions taken or omitted
to be taken in its capacity as Holder Representative, except with respect to
the Holder Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Holder Representative will at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Holders; provided, however, that the Holder
Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and shall
be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as
Holder Representative, unless the Holder Representative has been provided
with funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the
Holder Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Holder Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action.
The Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts
and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection
with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement, from funds paid to
it under Section 1.6 of this Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its
capacity as Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including
fees and     ##### 

  

     

disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and for
indemnification against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Holder Representative
(except for those arising out of the Holder Representatives gross negligence
or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and
defense of claims.   

ARTICLE XII. TAX MATTERS    

 Section 12.1. Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.   

 (a) The Company shall timely prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed Tax Returns of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries that is required to be filed before the Closing Date. Acquiror shall not amend or revoke any such Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating thereto) except to the extent required to comply with applicable law; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no claim may be brought by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees for any Damages arising out of or in connection with any prior tax position changed as a result of filing the amended return.   

 (b) Acquiror shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Tax Returns are the responsibility of the Company under Section 12.1(a). Acquiror shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and filed within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet all income and franchise Tax Returns with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for the short taxable year ending on the Closing Date (the "Short Period Returns"). For any Straddle Period Tax Return and any Tax Return with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that is the    ##### 

  

  

responsibility of Acquiror under this Section 12.1(b) (the "Transition
Returns"), Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by applicable law, and Acquiror shall
deliver to the Holder Representative for its review, comment and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) a copy of such proposed
Tax Returns at least thirty days prior to the due date (giving effect to any
validly obtained extensions) thereof; provided that the Acquiror shall cause
the proposed Short Period Returns to be delivered to Holder Representative no
later than fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet.
Acquiror shall reflect in good faith any reasonable comments received from
Holder Representative with respect to the Transition Returns and any refund
claims made pursuant to Section 12.2. Acquiror shall not amend or revoke any
Straddle Period Tax Return or a Short Period Return except to the extent
required to comply with applicable law; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no claim may be
brought by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees for any Damages arising out of or
in connection with any prior tax position changed as a result of filing the
amended return.   

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any taxable period with respect to which Acquiror has the responsibility to file Tax Returns under Section 12.1(b), (i) property Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries allocable to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of such property Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during such period that are in such taxable period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and (ii) Taxes (other than property Taxes) of the Company and    ##### 

  

  

its Subsidiaries allocable to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on
the Closing Date shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the
end of the Closing Date.   

 Section 12.2. Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks.   

 (a) The parties anticipate that as a result of the Closing Tax Benefits, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to seek a refund of income and franchise Taxes paid for the short taxable year ending on the Closing Date, and in addition will have a net operating loss for such taxable year. In consultation with the Holder Representative, the Acquiror shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to prepare and file as expeditiously as reasonably possible after the receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, claims for refunds of income and franchise Taxes paid through the Closing Date for the short taxable year ending on the Closing Date, and claims to carry back the net operating loss for such taxable year to prior years to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including a claim for a tentative refund on IRS Form 1139), together with any necessary state and local filings to apply the net operating loss arising in such short taxable year so as to receive a refund of past Taxes paid.   

 (b) Acquiror shall, at the Holder Representatives reasonable request and at Holder Representatives expense, and in consultation with the Holder Representative, cause the relevant entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any refund (other than refunds the treatment of which is governed by subsection (a)) to which the Company and/or its Subsidiaries is entitled under applicable law in respect of any period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay to the Holder Representative as additional Merger Consideration (for distribution by the Holder Representative to the holders of Common Shares and Options on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Applicable Percentages) the amount of    ##### 

  

  

any such refunds (including any interest paid with respect to Taxes paid)
within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such refunds to the extent such
refunds exceed $2,000,000.   

 Section 12.3. Tax Contests. If any taxing authority asserts a Holder Representative Tax Claim in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries, then the party hereto first receiving notice of such tax claim shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto within ten calendar days; provided, however, that the failure of such party to give timely notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this Article XII, except to the extent that the other party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Holder Representative Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the taxing authority. Pursuant to and subject to Section 13.5, the Holder Representative shall have the right to control any Holder Representative Tax Claim. Acquiror shall have the right to control any claim for Taxes involving the Company and its Subsidiaries other than a Holder Representative Tax Claim.   

 Section 12.4. Cooperation. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the other party hereto with such cooperation, documentation and information as either of them reasonably may request, including without limitation, in (a) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (b) determining a liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this Article XII or a right to refund of Taxes or (c) conducting any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any taxing authority. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant accompanying schedules and work papers (or portions thereof) and other supporting documentation, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and    ##### 

  

  

any other relevant information, which any such party may possess. Acquiror
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to retain all Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, and all material records and other documents
relating to Tax matters, of the relevant entities for their respective Tax
periods ending on or prior to or including the Closing Date until ninety (90)
days after the Cutoff Date; provided, that if any claim for indemnity is made
under Section 13.2 prior to such date, Acquiror shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to retain the records until ninety (90) days after the claim
for indemnity has been finally resolved. Acquiror shall cause its Affiliates,
the Company and its Subsidiaries to make its employees reasonably available
on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any
documents or information so provided.   

 Section 12.5. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" under Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of state, local, or foreign Law), Holder Representative, Acquiror, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under Article XII as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes.   

 Section 12.6. Tax Covenant Concerning Foreign Subsidiaries. With respect to any Subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of a country other than the United States (a "Foreign Subsidiary"), from the date of the Closing through the end of the taxable period of such entity that includes the Closing Date, Acquiror shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, take any action or enter into any transaction that would be considered under the Code to constitute the payment of an actual or deemed dividend by such Foreign Subsidiary (including pursuant to Section 304 of the Code), or that would otherwise result    ##### 

  

  

in a diminution of foreign tax credits that, absent such transaction may be
claimed by the Company and its Subsidiaries.   

 Section 12.7. Transfer Taxes. Any and all sales, use, registration, transfer (including all real estate transfer and conveyance and recording fees, if any), stamp, stamp duty reserve, stamp duty land tax, VAT, or other similar taxes and all notarial fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") that may be imposed upon, payable, collectible or incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the Person liable for such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law shall be borne one-half by Acquiror and the other half by the Holder Representative as a Holder Allocable Expense. Holder Representative and Acquiror shall cooperate in the execution and filing of any Tax Returns, affidavits or other documents relating to any Transfer Taxes.   

 Section 12.8. Controlling Article. To the extent of any conflict between Article XIII and this Article XII, this Article XII shall control.   

ARTICLE XIII. 
 INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES    

 Section 13.1. Survival; Right To Indemnification Not Affected By Knowledge.   

 (a) Except as set forth in the next sentence, all representations and warranties, and all covenants to be performed at or before the Closing in this Agreement or in any instrument or document furnished in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any party for a period ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Cutoff Date").

The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.   

 Section 13.2. Indemnification And Payment Of Damages By Holders of Company Common Stock.

 (b) The Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification (severally and not jointly) from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and thereafter, to the extent the Indemnification Escrow Amount is unavailable therefor, from each Company Principal Shareholder, for any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:    

 (i) any inaccuracy or breach of the representation and warranty made by such Company Principal Shareholder in this Agreement; or

Indemnification Escrow Amount shall constitute the sole source of payment or
recovery for all claims for indemnification by the Purchaser Indemnitees

 (a) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror in this Agreement or any other certificate or document delivered by Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement;

 Section 13.4. Limitations On Amount. (a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, (i) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for which all Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), at which time the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent all Damages for which all Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII exceed the Threshold Amount, (ii) the aggregate amount of Damages for which all Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to (x) 8,000,000 multiplied by (y) the Closing Stock Price (the "Indemnification Cap") and (iii) in no event shall any Company Principal Shareholder be liable for any Damages in excess of such Company Principal Shareholders Applicable Percentage of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all claims for indemnification by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to this Article XIII shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds or tax benefits received by the Purchaser Indemnitees. In the event that any such insurance proceeds are actually realized by an indemnified party subsequent to the receipt by such indemnified party of an indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly regarding the amount of such indemnification payment.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, (i) no Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages for which all Seller Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII exceeds the Threshold Amount, at which time the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent all Damages for which all Seller Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII exceeds the Threshold Amount and (ii) the aggregate amount of Damages for which all Seller Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the Indemnification Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all claims for indemnification by the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this Article XIII shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds or tax benefits received by the Seller Indemnitees. In the event that any such insurance proceeds are actually realized by an indemnified party subsequent to the receipt by such indemnified party of an indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly regarding the amount of such indemnification payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 13.4(b) do not apply to any claim for indemnification arising out of, or relating to, any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement contained in Article I hereof, Section 6.6 hereof or Article XII hereof. No Seller Indemnitee shall have any right of contribution against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its representation, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.   

 Section 13.5. Indemnification Procedure. A Person entitled to indemnification under this Articles XIII (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written notification to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any third party claim for which such Indemnified Party desires to    ##### 

  

 

seek indemnification pursuant to this Article XIII (a "Third Party Action");
provided, however, that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified
Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any
damage or liability caused by or arising out of such failure or to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Within 30 days after delivery
of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof
to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party
Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided that the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of
Third Party Action involving criminal liability or in which equitable relief
is sought against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not,
or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the
defense of a Third Party Action, the Indemnified Party shall control such
defense. The non-controlling party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The controlling party shall keep the non-controlling party advised
of the status of such Third Party Action and the defense thereof and shall
consider in good faith recommendations made by the non-controlling party with
respect thereto. The non-controlling party shall furnish the controlling
party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party
Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which
may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with the controlling party in the defense of such Third
Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with
respect to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of
this Agreement if (i) the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of
such Third Party Action (or is not permitted to assume such defense under the
terms hereof) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense
and representation of     ##### 

  

    

the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would
constitute a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional
conduct. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in
writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment
and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from further liability and has no other material adverse
effect on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third
Party Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that such consent may be withheld in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party has assumed
control of the defense of such Third Party Action. For the purpose of this
paragraph only, the term "Indemnifying Party" means (i) in the case of
any indemnification claim asserted by a Seller Indemnitee, Acquiror and (ii)
in the case of any indemnification claim asserted by a Purchaser Indemnitee,
the Holder Representative.    

 Section 13.6. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The foregoing indemnification is given solely for the purpose of protecting the Purchaser Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees and shall not be deemed extended to, or interpreted in a manner to confer any benefit, right, or cause of action upon, any other individual or entity.   

ARTICLE XIV.

Summary of Terms of Indemnification Escrow Agreement     

 The Indemnification Escrow Agreement will contain such terms and conditions as are customary for such an agreement in transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement and shall also provide that:   

       |   | The Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration and any
substitutions of property therefor (the "Escrow Property") shall be held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent to serve as the sole source of payment of
indemnification claims (except with respect to claims for breach of
the representations made by the Company Principal Shareholders) asserted
pursuant to Section 13.2 of the Agreement (an "Acquiror Indemnification
Claims").  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | The Escrow Property will not be released from escrow in
payment of any Acquiror Indemnification Claim without the consent of the
Holder Representative unless Acquiror delivers to the Escrow Agent a copy of
a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction (a "Final
Order") determining that Acquiror is entitled to payment of such claim for
indemnification under Section 13.2 of the Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | The Escrow Property (or any remaining balance of the
Escrow Property) shall be released and distributed to the holders of Common
Shares and Options (pro rata, in accordance with their Applicable
Percentages) on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that, in the event that, on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, there
is pending an Acquiror Indemnification Claim that has not been paid or
resolved against the Purchaser Indemnitees asserting such claim (a "Pending
Claim"), the Escrow Agent shall retain and not distribute to the holders of
Common Shares and Options (until payment or final resolution of such Pending
Claim) a portion of the Escrow Property having a market value equal to the
amount of Damages asserted in such Pending Claim.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | To the extent that Acquiror is determined to be entitled
to receive any shares of Acquiror Common Stock held in escrow in payment of
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 13.2
of the Agreement, Acquiror shall be entitled to receive a number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (x) the amount of such Damages, divided by
(y) the average closing price for one share of Acquiror Common Stock for the
ten (10) Business Day period ending on Business Day immediately preceding
the date on which such shares are released from escrow.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | As provided in Section 1.8 of the Agreement, at the
option of the Holder Representative, the Holder Representative may elect to
remove any shares of Acquiror Common Stock from escrow and replace such
removed shares  
---|---|--- 
     ##### 

  

   

       |   | with cash in an amount equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock so removed and (y) the Closing
Stock Price.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | The shares of Acquiror Common Stock held in escrow shall
be voted by the Escrow Agent while held in escrow in accordance with the
written instructions of the holders of Common Shares and Options that would
be the holders of such shares if such shares had not been placed in
escrow.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | Acquiror shall pay 50% of the fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent and 50% of such fees and expenses shall be paid by the Holder
Representative as Holder Allocable Expenses.

Summary of Terms of Investor Rights Agreement    

 The Investor Rights Agreement will provide for the following:   

       |   | Acquiror will provide to MPI Holdings, LLC or its
designee the right to appoint a non-voting observer to the board of directors
of Acquiror so long as MPI Holdings, LLC or its Affiliates hold more than 5%
of the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock. The non-voting observer
will be entitled to receive notice of, and attend, all meetings of the board
of directors of Acquiror.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | MPI Holdings, LLC or its designee shall be provided by
Acquiror reasonable access and information rights to the extent reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable Venture Capital Operating Company
requirements, including the right to reasonable access to the books
and records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries and to discuss the business and
affairs of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries with management of the Acquiror.  
---|---|--- 
     

       |   | Acquiror shall grant to the holders of Acquiror Common
Stock issued pursuant to the Agreement the following registration rights:  
---|---|--- 
     

 (a) (i) Acquiror shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger, a registration statement on Form S-3 (or, if Acquiror is not eligible to file on Form S-3, on the appropriate form) (the "Registration Statement") to cover resales of the shares (the "Registerable Shares") of Acquiror Common Stock constituting the Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration. Acquiror shall cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Closing Date. Acquiror shall keep such Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current in conformity with this Annex H, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available for resales of the Registerable Shares for a period ending on the earlier of (x) the date on which all Registerable Shares have been sold pursuant to such Registration Statement and (y) the date on which all Registerable Shares are eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act (the "Rights Period"). Acquiror hereby agrees, upon written request from the Holder Representative, to file one or more prospectus supplements or otherwise amend the Registration Statement from time to time as appropriate to permit the sale and distribution of the Registerable Shares in one or more (but not more than three (3)) underwritten offerings, led by a managing underwriter selected by the Holder Representative and reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. Furthermore, Acquiror hereby agrees that the Registration Statement shall provide for any intended method or methods of distribution as may be reasonably requested by the Holder Representative in writing (who in turn will request that Acquiror accommodate any reasonable requests of the holders of Registerable Shares with respect to the intended method or methods of distribution), and to amend or supplement the Registration Statement from time to time as may be reasonably requested by the Holder Representative to provide for such intended method or    ##### 

  

 

methods of distribution of shares as may be reasonably requested by the
Holder Representative in writing.    

 (ii) Each time Acquiror decides to file a registration statement under the Securities Act (other than registrations on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor form thereto, and other than the Registration Statement set forth in the foregoing clause (a)(i)) covering the offer and sale by it or any holders of its equity securities for cash (a "Piggyback Registration"), Acquiror shall give written notice thereof to the Holder Representative. Acquiror shall include in any such registration statement such Registerable Shares for which it has received a written notice from the Holder Representative to register such shares within twenty (20) days after such written notice has been received by the Holder Representative. If the Piggyback Registration is to cover an underwritten offering, the Registerable Shares shall be included in such underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the securities of Acquiror otherwise being sold through such underwriting (it being understood that each holder of Registerable Shares will have the right to include such holders Registerable Shares on a pro rata basis among all such holders participating in the offering). Such Piggyback Registration rights can only be exercised during the Rights Period. Such Piggyback Registration rights shall be subject to the right, however, of Acquiror and its underwriters to reduce the number of Registerable Shares proposed to be included in any underwritten offering for marketing reasons as reasonably determined by the underwriters; provided, however, that, the Acquiror shall exclude from such offering shares held by stockholders of Acquiror other than the Registerable Shares on a pro rata basis with the Registerable Shares. Acquiror shall have the right to withdraw any such registration statement prior to it being effective in its sole discretion. Holders of Registerable Shares shall, if requested by the underwriters, agree to not to sell or transfer any Registerable Shares for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following the effectiveness of a registration statement effected pursuant to this Annex H; provided that such holders sell Registerable Shares pursuant to such Piggyback Registration.   

 (b) Acquiror will bear the costs of all Registration Expenses; provided, however, that Acquirors obligations to pay such Registration Expenses in respect of any underwritten offerings (other than any underwritten offering effected pursuant to Section (a)(ii) above) shall be limited to three (3) such underwritten offerings requested by the holders of Registerable Shares. For the purposes hereof, "Registration Expenses" shall mean all expenses incident to Acquirors preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and incident to any Piggyback Registration, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities laws and state blue sky laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians and fees and disbursements of counsel for Acquiror and one counsel for the Holder Representative (up to $50,000 in the aggregate for such counsel) and all independent certified public accountants, and other persons retained by Acquiror.   

 (c) In connection with the registration and sale of the Registerable Shares pursuant to Section (a)(i) and, pursuant to Section (a)(ii) solely with respect to clauses (iii) and (iv) below, Acquiror will:    

 (i) Prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable the Registration Statement as set forth above;    ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the applicable period set forth in Section (a)(i); cause the Registration Statement to be supplemented by any required supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with Rules 424, 430A and 462, as applicable, under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement;    

 (iii) Provide to each holder of Registerable Shares such copies of the Registration Statement and related prospectus, and each amendment and supplement thereto, as are reasonably requested to satisfy any prospectus delivery requirements;    

 (iv) Use its best efforts to register or qualify the Registerable Shares under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as each holder of Registerable Shares may reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each holder or Registerable Shares to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registerable Shares owned by such holder; provided, however, that Acquiror will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph, (B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (C) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;    

 (v) Upon the occurrence of any event that would cause the Registration Statement (A) to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) to be not effective and useable for resale of the Registerable Shares during the period that such Registration Statement is required to be effective and useable, Acquiror shall as promptly as practicable file any correcting information or an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement, as Acquiror deems appropriate, correcting any such defect, and use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and such Registration Statement to become useable as soon as practicable thereafter;    

 (vi) cause all Registerable Shares to be listed for quotation on the NASDAQ National Market;    

 (vii) provide a CUSIP for all Registerable Shares not later than the effective date of the Registration Statement;    

 (viii) cooperate with the Holder Representative and the managing underwriter, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates not bearing any restrictive legends representing the Registerable Shares to be sold and cause such Registerable Shares to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter may reasonably request;    ##### 

  

   

 (ix) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter of such offering and perform all other action as are customary in such an underwritten public offering, including, if requested by the underwriter, reasonable participation of senior management of Acquiror in a "road show" to the extent such participation does not unduly interfere with the conduct of Acquirors business; provided, however, that Acquiror shall not be obligated to provide its cooperation with respect to more than three (3) underwritten public offerings (excluding underwritten offerings effected pursuant to Section (a)(ii) of this Annex H) made at the request of the Holder Representative; and    

 (x) enter into such agreements (including an underwriting agreement) and do anything else reasonably necessary or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registerable Shares in accordance with applicable law and the disclosure set forth in the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that Acquiror shall not be obligated to provide its cooperation with respect to more than three (3) underwritten public offerings made at the request of the Holder Representative.   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Annex H, Acquiror may prohibit offers and sales of the Registerable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement once during any 12-month period if (A) (1) it is in possession of material non-public information, (2) the Board of Directors determines based on advice of counsel that such prohibition is necessary in order to avoid a requirement to disclose such material non-public information, and (3) the Board of Directors of Acquiror determines in good faith that disclosure of such material non-public information would not be in the best interests of Acquiror and its stockholders, or (B) Acquiror has made a public announcement relating to an acquisition or business combination transaction including Acquiror and/or one or more of its subsidiaries (1) that is material to Acquiror and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (2) the Board of Directors of Acquiror determines in good faith that offers and sales of the Registerable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement prior to the consummation of such transaction (or such earlier date as the Board of Directors shall determine) is not in the best interests of Acquiror and its stockholders (the period during which any such prohibition of offers and sales of Registerable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement is in effect pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of this Section (d) is referred to herein as a "Suspension Period"). A Suspension Period shall commence on and include the date on which Acquiror provides written notice to holders of Acquiror Common Stock covered by the Registration Statement that offers and sales of Registerable Shares cannot be made thereunder in accordance with this Section (d) and shall end three business days after the earlier to occur of (x) the date on which such material information is disclosed to the public or ceases to be material or Acquiror is able to so comply with its disclosure obligations and SEC requirements, or (y) sixty (60) days after written notice is provided by Acquiror to the holders of Registerable Shares of the commencement of such Suspension Period. Each notice shall state to the extent, if any, as is practicable, an estimate of the expected duration of the Suspension Period.   

 (e) As a condition to including Registerable Shares of a holder in any registration, such holder shall furnish to Acquiror such information requested by Acquiror as is required by law to be disclosed in the Registration Statement with respect to a sale by such holder of Registerable Shares (the "Requisite Information") with respect to any such sales pursuant to    ##### 

  

 

such Registration Statement. Each holder of Registerable Shares as to which
any Registration Statement is being effected agrees prior to effecting any
sale of the Registerable Shares thereunder to furnish promptly to Acquiror
all information required to be disclosed in order to make any Requisite
Information previously furnished to Acquiror by such holder of Registerable
Shares not materially misleading or necessary to cause such Registration
Statement not to omit a material fact with respect to such holder of
Registerable Shares necessary in order to make the statements therein not
