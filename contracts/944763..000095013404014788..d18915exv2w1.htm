reasonably practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger, a registration
statement on Form S-3 (or, if Acquiror is not eligible to file on Form S-3, on
the appropriate form) (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) to cover resales of the
shares (the &#147;Registerable Shares&#148;) of Acquiror Common Stock constituting the
Stock Portion of the Merger Consideration. Acquiror shall cause such
Registration Statement to be declared effective within 180&nbsp;days after the
Closing Date. Acquiror shall keep such Registration Statement continuously
effective, supplemented, amended and current in conformity with this Annex H,
the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the SEC to the
extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available for
resales of the Registerable Shares for a period ending on the earlier of (x)
the date on which all Registerable Shares have been sold pursuant to such
Registration Statement and (y)&nbsp;the date on which all Registerable Shares are
eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act (the
&#147;Rights Period&#148;). Acquiror hereby agrees, upon written request from the Holder
Representative, to file one or more prospectus supplements or otherwise amend
the Registration Statement from time to time as appropriate to permit the sale
and distribution of the Registerable Shares in one or more (but not more than
three (3)) underwritten offerings, led by a managing underwriter selected by
the Holder Representative and reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. Furthermore,
Acquiror hereby agrees that the Registration Statement shall provide for any
intended method or methods of distribution as may be reasonably requested by
the Holder Representative in writing (who in turn will request that Acquiror
accommodate any reasonable requests of the holders of Registerable Shares with
respect to the intended method or methods of distribution), and to amend or
supplement the Registration Statement from time to time as may be reasonably
requested by the Holder Representative to provide for such intended method or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Each time Acquiror decides to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act (other than registrations on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor
form thereto, and other than the Registration Statement set forth in the
foregoing clause (a)(i)) covering the offer and sale by it or any holders of
its equity securities for cash (a &#147;Piggyback Registration&#148;), Acquiror shall
give written notice thereof to the Holder Representative. Acquiror shall
include in any such registration statement such Registerable Shares for which
it has received a written notice from the Holder Representative to register
such shares within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after such written notice has been received
by the Holder Representative. If the Piggyback Registration is to cover an
underwritten offering, the Registerable Shares shall be included in such
underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the securities of Acquiror
otherwise being sold through such underwriting (it being understood that each
holder of Registerable Shares will have the right to include such holder&#146;s
Registerable Shares on a pro rata basis among all such holders participating in
the offering). Such Piggyback Registration rights can only be exercised during
the Rights Period. Such Piggyback Registration rights shall be subject to the
right, however, of Acquiror and its underwriters to reduce the number of
Registerable Shares proposed to be included in any underwritten offering for
marketing reasons as reasonably determined by the underwriters; provided,
however, that, the Acquiror shall exclude from such offering shares held by
stockholders of Acquiror other than the Registerable Shares on a pro rata basis
with the Registerable Shares. Acquiror shall have the right to withdraw any
such registration statement prior to it being effective in its sole discretion.
Holders of Registerable Shares shall, if requested by the underwriters, agree
to not to sell or transfer any Registerable Shares for a period of up to one
hundred eighty (180)&nbsp;days following the effectiveness of a registration
statement effected pursuant to this Annex H; provided that such holders sell
Registerable Shares pursuant to such Piggyback Registration.

however, that Acquiror&#146;s obligations to pay such Registration Expenses in
respect of any underwritten offerings (other than any underwritten offering
effected pursuant to Section (a)(ii) above) shall be limited to three (3)&nbsp;such
underwritten offerings requested by the holders of Registerable Shares. For
the purposes hereof, &#147;Registration Expenses&#148; shall mean all expenses incident
to Acquiror&#146;s preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and incident
to any Piggyback Registration, including, without limitation, all registration
and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities laws

Acquiror and one counsel for the Holder Representative (up to $50,000 in the

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B)&nbsp;to be not
effective and useable for resale of the Registerable Shares during the

Acquiror deems appropriate, correcting any such defect, and use its best
efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and such

thereafter;
