property of the Parent, and any holder of such share of Company Capital Stock
who has not theretofore complied with this Article II with respect thereto
shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of such holder's claim
for the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or Per Share Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration (as applicable) payable in respect thereof in
accordance with Section 2.7. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iv) \t\t\tIn the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (a "Lost
Certificate Affidavit") by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue, or will cause to be
issued, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
payments with respect to such Certificate to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to this Article II; provided, that the Person to whom such payments
are made shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify
Parent and the Surviving Company against any claim that may be made against
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company with respect to the Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(v) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-29-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any applicable provision of any Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (x)
shall be remitted by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (y)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(vi) \t\t\tIf payment of the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration or Per Share Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as
applicable) in respect of a share of Company Capital Stock is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(vii) \t\t\tNo dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or
uncertificated shares of Company Capital Stock) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment with
respect any cash portion of the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or
Per Share Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (as applicable) or in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of
such Certificate (or uncertificated shares of Company Capital Stock) in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or uncertificated shares of
Common Stock), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, (1) the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(viii) and (2) the amount of
dividends or other distributions declared on the shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such
surrender that is payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(viii) \t\t\tNo certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Preferred
Stock pursuant to this Article II. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of
Preferred Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by
the Reference Price.

 \t\t\t\t (l) \t\t\tThe following provisions shall be applicable to payment
of the Per Share Preferred Stock Merger Consideration: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tIn order to be eligible to receive Parent Common Stock,
each holder of Preferred Stock shall deliver to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, no later than four (4) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date an executed Accredited Investor Questionnaire in
substantially the form previously provided to Parent (the "Accredited Investor
Questionnaire"), certifying, among other things, that such holder of Preferred
Stock is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under
the Securities Act and specifying the relevant provision of Rule 501 pursuant
to which such "accredited investor" status is to be verified, and a Joinder
Agreement (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1) further confirming such
Holder's eligibility to receive Parent Common Stock. Nothing contained herein
shall require Parent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock to any Person that
Parent knows is not an Accredited Investor. For all purposes under this
Agreement, an "Accredited Investor" is a holder of Preferred Stock who
satisfies the foregoing conditions of this Section 2.9(c)(i) within the
timeframe specified, as reasonably determined by Parent. Any holder of
Preferred Stock that does not provide the information required by this Section
2.9(c)(i) within the timeframe specified may be conclusively determined, in
Parent's sole discretion, not to be an Accredited Investor for all purposes of
this Agreement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tThe certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued and delivered hereunder shall bear the following
legend: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR
OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO
THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE
OR OTHER JURISDICTION OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT
AND SUCH LAWS. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION." \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tIn the event that any such shares of Parent Common
Stock cease to be Restricted Shares, Parent shall, upon the written request of
the holder thereof, issue to such holder a new certificate representing such
shares of Parent Common Stock without the legend required by the foregoing
Section 2.9(c)(ii). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iv) \t\t\tSubject to the terms and conditions of the Registration
Rights Agreement, during the time that any such shares of Parent Common Stock
are Restricted Shares, a  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-31-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

holder of such shares shall not transfer (including through a distribution in
kind to any limited partners of such holder or otherwise to any Beneficial
Owner) such shares of Parent Common Stock without first delivering to Parent a
written opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, that such transfer is being effected in a transaction exempt from
registration under the Securities Act that otherwise complies with any
applicable securities Laws of any state or other jurisdiction and that would
not in any way invalidate or interfere with Parent's state or federal
securities offering exemptions utilized in issuing Parent Common Stock in the
Merger. Any transferee of a holder of Parent Common Stock acquired hereby
shall take such Parent Common Stock subject to the restrictions set forth
herein. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (m) \t\t\tNotwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Agreement, if the Estimated Purchase Price is less than $39,000,000, (i) the
Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration shall be equal to zero, (ii) the Estimated
Purchase Price shall consist solely of the Aggregate Equity Amount, (iii) the
Aggregate Equity Amount will be reduced below $39,000,000 to an amount equal
to the Estimated Purchase Price, and (iv) the Escrowed Amounts will be funded
with shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to Accredited Investors
pursuant to Section 2.9(c) on a pro rata basis based on the Reference Price
and the relative number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to
the Accredited Investors.

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tNot less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement prepared in good
faith setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the estimated Cash on Hand as of
the Effective Time, (ii) the estimated Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (including an itemized list of each
Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, with a
description of the nature of such Indebtedness and the Person to whom such
Indebtedness is owed), and (iii) the estimated unpaid Transaction Costs as of
the Effective Time (including an itemized list of each Transaction Cost with a
description of the nature of such expense and the Person to whom such expense
was or is owed). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tWithin ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the
"True Up Date"), Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders' Representative
Parent's determination in good faith of (i) the Working Capital of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the Effective Time, as
determined in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP,
the accounting policies and methods of the Company used in the preparation of
the Latest Company Balance Sheet (the "Final Working Capital"), (ii) the Cash
on Hand as of the Effective Time, (iii) the Indebtedness of the Company and of
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, and (iv) unpaid Transaction Costs
(collectively, the "True Up Calculations"). If the Stockholders'
Representative accepts the True Up Calculations, or if the Stockholders'
Representative fails to give notice to Parent of any objection within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the True Up Calculations, the True Up Calculations
shall be used for the calculation of the Purchase Price adjustments set forth
in Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d) and Section 2.10(e) (the "Final
Adjustment"). During the thirty (30) day period immediately following Parent's
delivery to the Stockholders' Representative of the True Up Calculations, the
Stockholders' Representative (and its third party consultants and accountants)
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-32-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

shall be permitted to review Parent's working papers and underlying accounting
records reasonably related to the preparation, and reasonably related to the
Stockholders' Representative review and confirmation, of the True Up
Calculations and Parent's determination of the Final Adjustment. Parent shall
reasonably cooperate and provide prompt and reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Company's books and records and relevant personnel
(including third party consultants and accountants), in each case as
reasonably requested by the Stockholders' Representative and its third party
consultants and accountants) in connection with the Stockholders'
Representative's review and dispute, if any, of the True Up Calculations. If
the Stockholders' Representative gives written notice to Parent of an
objection to the True Up Calculations within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the True Up Calculations (the "Dispute Notice"), Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall attempt to resolve their differences. If Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative are able to resolve their differences, the True
Up Calculations, as modified to reflect the resolution of the differences
between Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, shall be used for the
calculation of the Final Adjustment, as agreed by Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative in writing. If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative,
however, are unable to resolve their differences, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall submit any disputed items to the Dallas, Texas office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Independent Accountant") for a resolution of
the dispute. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be binding
on Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, and the True Up Calculations,
as modified to reflect (i) those differences, if any, that Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative were able to resolve, and (ii) the Independent
Accountant's determination with regard to the remaining disputed items, shall
be used for the Final Adjustment. The adjustments in this Section 2.10 shall
be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only
decide the specific items under dispute pursuant to this Section 2.10 by the
parties to this Agreement, and its decision for each disputed amount must be
within the range of values assigned to each such item in the True Up Statement
and the Dispute Notice, respectively. The Stockholders' Representative, for
and on behalf of the Common Stockholders and the Preferred Stockholders, shall
pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant equal to
the quotient of (x) the difference between the Independent Accountant's
determination and the Stockholders' Representative's determination, divided by
(y) the difference between the Parent's determination and the Stockholders'
Representative's determination. Parent shall pay that portion of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountant that the Stockholders' Representative
is not required to pay hereunder.

 \t\t\t\t (p) \t\t\tIf the True Up Calculations (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) indicate that the Final Working Capital is: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tgreater than the sum of (A) the Target Working Capital
plus (B) the Collar Amount, then the amount by which the Final Working Capital
exceeds the sum of (A) the Target Working Capital plus (B) the Collar Amount
(which shall be a positive number) shall be the "Working Capital Adjustment;"

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tless than or equal to the sum of (A) the Target Working
Capital plus (B) the Collar Amount, and is greater than or equal to the result
of (x) the Target Working Capital minus (y) the Collar Amount, then the
"Working Capital Adjustment" shall be equal to zero; and

Collar Amount, then (x) the Final Working Capital minus (y) (1) the Target
Working Capital minus (2) the Collar Amount, which shall be a negative number,
shall be the "Working Capital Adjustment."

pursuant to Section 2.10(b)) indicate that the Final Price Deduction: 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\texceeds the Estimated Price Deduction, then the "True Up
Price Deduction" shall be equal to the Final Price Deduction minus the
Estimated Price Deduction, which amount shall be a positive number; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tis equal to the Estimated Price Deduction, then the
"True Up Price Deduction" shall be equal to zero; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tis less than the Estimated Price Deduction, then the
"True Up Price Deduction" shall be equal to the Final Price Deduction minus
the Estimated Price Deduction, which amount shall be a negative number. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (r) \t\t\tThe sum of the Working Capital Adjustment and the True
Up Price Deduction shall be equal to the Final Adjustment. Once the Final
Adjustment has been determined, 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tif the Final Adjustment is a positive number, then (A)
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) direct the Escrow Agent in writing to
distribute the Adjustment Reserve in immediately available funds either to the
Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock) or to
Parent's or the Surviving Company's, as applicable, payroll administrator (in
the case of holders of Company Options and participants in the Transaction
Bonus Pool), for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares and subject to prior compliance with the requirements,
conditions and procedures set forth in Section 2.9 and (B) Parent shall
promptly deliver an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount
of the Final Adjustment, either to the Exchange Agent (in the case of holders
of Company Capital Stock) or to Parent's or the Surviving Company's, as
applicable, payroll administrator (in the case of holders of Company Options
and participants in the Transaction Bonus Pool), for further distribution to
the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and subject to prior
compliance with the requirements, conditions and procedures set forth in
Section 2.9; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tif the Final Adjustment is equal to zero, then (A)
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) direct the Escrow Agent in writing to
distribute the Adjustment Reserve in immediately available funds either to the
Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock) or to
Parent's or the Surviving Company's, as applicable, payroll administrator (in
the case of holders of Company Options and participants in the Transaction
Bonus Pool), for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tif the Final Adjustment is a negative number, then
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) direct the Escrow Agent in writing to
distribute (A) to Parent, from the Adjustment Reserve, an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment (for purposes of clarification if the Final Adjustment is negative
$400,000, the distribution to Parent from the Adjustment Reserve shall equal
$400,000), and, (B) if the amount of such distribution is (1) less than the
remaining amounts held in the Adjustment Reserve prior to such distribution,
the remaining portion of the Adjustment Reserve in immediately available funds
either to the Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock)
or to Parent's or the Surviving Company's, as applicable, payroll
administrator (in the case of holders of Company Options and participants in
the Transaction Bonus Pool), for further distribution to the Holders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and subject to prior compliance with the
requirements, conditions and procedures set forth in Section 2.9, or (2)
equal to or greater than the remaining amounts held in the Adjustment Reserve
prior to such distribution, then Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) direct the
Escrow Agent in writing to distribute to Parent, from the Adjustment Reserve,
an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amounts remaining in the
Adjustment Reserve, and each of the Holders shall pay Parent such Holder's Pro
Rata Share of an amount in immediately available funds equal to (1) the
absolute value of the Final Adjustment, minus (2) the amounts distributed to
Parent from the Adjustment Reserve pursuant to this sentence; provided,
however, at Parent's written election, which shall be in Parent's sole
discretion, the Stockholders' Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow
Agent in writing, jointly with Parent, to distribute, from the Indemnification
Escrow Account, an amount equal to (x) the absolute value of the Final
Adjustment minus (y) amounts distributed from the Adjustment Reserve minus (z)
the amounts paid by Holders to Parent pursuant to this sentence; provided,
further, that in the event any Holder does not make a payment of its Pro Rata
Share of a payment to Parent in circumstances where Parent has collected such
a payment from other Holders, Parent shall only be entitled to a distribution
of funds from the Indemnification Escrow Account when such amounts would
otherwise be distributed to such non-paying Holder(s) (and only from the
amounts that would be distributed to such non-paying Holder(s)) upon the
distribution of the Indemnification Escrow Account.

Certain Adjustments \t\t

 \t\t\t. If, during the Interim Period (and as permitted by Section 5.2),
the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of
shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Per Share Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration and the Per Option Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change; provided that nothing in this Section 2.11 shall be construed to
permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

Maximum Obligation \t\t

 \t\t\t. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
maximum aggregate consideration payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement
shall  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-35-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

in no event exceed the Estimated Purchase Price, as adjusted, if applicable,
pursuant to Section 2.10, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.9(b)(viii). \t\t

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

liable for, or has any liability of any kind (whether fixed or contingent)
with regard to any Benefit Plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by an
ERISA Affiliate, including predecessors thereof, (if a like definition of
Benefit Plan were applicable to the ERISA Affiliate in the same manner as it
applies to the Company and its Subsidiaries) (each such Benefit Plan for an

PBGC, the IRS or any other Governmental Authority or by any plan participant
or beneficiary pending, threatened in writing, or relating to the Benefit

Plans, or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Benefit Plans
(other than routine claims for benefits) nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
are there facts or circumstances that exist that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such Actions; and 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(v) \t\t\tif a Benefit Plan purports to be a voluntary employees'
beneficiary association, a request for a determination letter with respect to
such association has been submitted to and approved by the IRS that such
association is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code, and nothing has occurred or is expected to occur that caused or could
cause  \t\t

the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any tax,

 \t\t\t\t (bb) \t\t\tExcept as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to contribute to or provide benefits
pursuant to, and has no other liability of any kind with respect to, (i) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40)
of ERISA), or (ii) a "plan maintained by more than one employer" (within the
meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (cc) \t\t\tExcept as set forth on Section 3.12(g) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, none of the Benefit Plans provide for payment of a benefit,
the increase of a benefit amount, the payment of a contingent benefit or the
acceleration of the payment or vesting of a benefit determined or occasioned,
in whole or in part, by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set forth on
Section 3.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no amount or benefit that
could be received by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G‑1) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event, and whether pursuant to a Benefit Plan or
otherwise) could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No Benefit Plan provides for
post‑employment medical or life insurance benefits with respect to Company
Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries except to the extent required
by Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state Law.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (dd) \t\t\tEach Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has complied
in form and operation with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. No
employee or director of or independent contractor to the Company or its
Subsidiaries is entitled to any gross‑up, make‑whole or other similar
additional payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
any Tax (including federal, state, local or foreign income, excise or other
Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Section 409A and 4999 of the Code)) or
interest or penalty related thereto. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ee) \t\t\tEach of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, have complied in all respects with the
employer shared responsibility mandate (the "ACA employer mandate") under Code
Section 4980H for each year in which it has been an "applicable large
employer" or an "applicable large employer member" (within the meaning of Code
Section 4980H), and neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliate is subject to, or reasonably could be expected to be subject
to, any "assessable payments" (within the meaning of Code Section 4980H) for
any month beginning prior to the Effective Time. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries uses a "look back measurement period" to determine "full
time employee" status for any category of employee for purposes of the ACA
employer mandate. No Benefit Plan is a "grandfathered" group health plan
under the ACA, and any such Benefit Plan previously sponsored or contributed
to satisfied at all times the requirements for such grandfathered status. On
and after January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
have maintained any (i) (pre-tax or after tax) "employer payment plan" (within
the meaning of IRS Notice  \t\t

with an employer group health plan that satisfies all applicable ACA
requirements.

Governmental Authority with or without payment of compensation therefor, nor,
to the Knowledge of the Company, has any such condemnation, expropriation or
taking been proposed. All Leases of Company Leased Real Property and all
amendments and modifications thereto are in full force and effect, and there
exists no default under or breach of any Company Lease by the Company, any of

Capitalization \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (c) \t\t\tAs of December 17, 2015, the authorized capital stock of
Parent consists of (i) 75,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which
29,764,880 shares are issued, 28,500,303 shares are issued and outstanding,
and 1,264,577 shares are held in treasury, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of

December  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-63-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (d) \t\t\tThe authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which have
been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent
free and clear of any Lien. 

---|--- 

Financing \t\t

 \t\t\t. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company
a debt commitment letter from its current Financing Sources (the "Debt
Commitment Letter") for the Financing in amounts that, together with Parent's
cash and cash equivalents, are sufficient to fund the payment of the cash
portion of the Estimated Purchase Price and deductions therefrom required to
be paid or otherwise funded by Parent at the Closing, and the payment of all
fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter remains in full force and effect, without modification
or amendment, and Parent has not received any written notice of any Financing
Source's intent to terminate, modify or amend the Debt Commitment Letter. The
Debt Commitment Letter constitutes valid and binding obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto,
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity,
and further limited by laws relating to the availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies). As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to (1) constitute a default or
breach of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, (2) to the
Knowledge of Parent, result in a failure of any condition to the Financing, or
(3) to the Knowledge of Parent, otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing being unavailable at the Closing. As of the date hereof, and other
than as set forth on Section 4.5 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are no
side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to which Parent or
any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing that could materially and adversely affect the availability of
the Financing. \t\t

Vote/Approval Required \t\t

 \t\t\t. No vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of Parent as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-64-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary
to approve this Agreement and the Merger. \t\t

SEC Reports \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (e) \t\t\tParent has filed all required forms, reports and
documents with the SEC since January 1, 2012 ("Parent SEC Documents"), and
each of such Parent SEC Documents complied at the time of filing (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then as
of the date of such filing) in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes‑Oxley
Act, as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and documents were filed.
None of the Parent SEC Documents contained when filed any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not
materially misleading, except to the extent superseded or amended by a Parent
SEC Document filed subsequently and prior to the date hereof. The consolidated
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) have
been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(except in each case as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except that
unaudited financial statements are subject to normal year‑end adjustments that
did not have and would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and do not contain footnotes to the extent permitted
by Form 10‑Q of the Exchange Act). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (f) \t\t\tParent has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d‑15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in Parent's periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, is made known to Parent's chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. The chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent have evaluated the
effectiveness of Parent's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable securities Law, presented in any applicable
Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10‑K or Form 10‑Q of the Exchange
Act, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (g) \t\t\tParent and its Subsidiaries have established and
maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a‑15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parent's financial reporting
and the preparation of the Parent's financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of Parent's internal control over financial reporting prior to the
date hereof, to Parent's auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parent's
internal  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-65-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
control over financial reporting. 

--- 

Absence of Certain Changes or Events \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as and to the extent set forth in Section 4.8 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and before the date hereof, since the date of the latest
balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Documents and through the date of
this Agreement: (a) the Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice; (b) there has not been any change, event or development or
prospective change, event or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; and (c) neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
suffered any loss, damage, destruction or other casualty affecting any of its
material properties or material assets, whether or not covered by
insurance. \t\t

Compliance with Laws and Permits \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have in effect all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, authorizations, operating certificates,
franchises, orders, approvals and similar authorizations (collectively,
"Parent Permits") of all Governmental Authorities necessary for them to own,
lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
and operations as now conducted, except where the failure to maintain in
effect such Parent Permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and no suspension, cancellation or other lapse of any
such Parent Permit is pending by or at the behest of any Governmental
Authority or other Person, or to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened. All
of such Parent Permits are currently in full force and effect, except where
the failure to maintain such Parent Permits in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January
1, 2012, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been in violation of
(i) any Parent Permits or (ii) any applicable Law, except for such violations
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. \t\t

Intellectual Property \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as and to the extent set forth in Section 4.10 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, Parent and its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate rights
to use all material Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of their
respective businesses, and Parent has not received any written notice or claim
asserting that any Intellectual Property owned by Parent infringes,
misappropriates, dilutes or violates any Intellectual Property owned by any
third party or constitutes unfair competition or unfair trade practices under
any applicable Law, except for such matters as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

Taxes \t\t

 \t\t\t. To the Knowledge of Parent, and except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a) each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or has had timely filed on its behalf)
all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to
any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Authority having
authority to do so) and all such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all
material respects or has established adequate reserves with respect to Taxes
due and payable pursuant to such Tax Returns, (ii) has paid (or Parent has
paid on its behalf) or established adequate reserves for all material Taxes
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-66-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

of it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are due and payable, (b)
neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has been notified of any pending
audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of material Taxes, (c) no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been agreed to
or are pending, (d) no claim has been made by any Tax authority, in a
jurisdiction where Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent do not file a Tax
Return, stating that any such entity is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction for Taxes that would be covered by the subject of such Tax
Return, (e) there are no Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet
due and payable or Taxes the validity or amount of which being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings) on any assets of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent and (f) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in any transaction that has given rise to or would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a disclosure obligation as a "listed transaction"
under Section 6011 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. \t\t

Brokers \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except for Canaccord Genuity Inc., no broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, the fees and expenses of which will be paid
by the Parent, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Parent or any of its Affiliates. \t\t

Issuance of Parent Common Stock \t\t

 \t\t\t. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Article
II of this Agreement upon consummation of the Merger (the "Share Issuance")
have been duly authorized and when issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will have been validly issued and will be fully paid and non-
assessable and the issuance thereof will not be subject to any preemptive
rights. The Share Issuance does not require the vote or approval of the
shareholders of Parent under the rules of NYSE. \t\t

Private Placement \t\t

 \t\t\t. Assuming the accuracy of the factual representations made in the
Joinder Agreements and in the Accredited Investor Questionnaires delivered to
Parent by each holder of Preferred Stock that is an Accredited Investor, no
registration under the Securities Act is required for the offer and issuance
of the Parent Common Stock by Parent as contemplated hereby. The issuance and
sale of the Parent Common Stock hereunder does not and will not contravene the
rules and regulations of the NYSE. \t\t

Registration Rights \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent has not granted or agreed to grant to any Person any rights
(including "piggy back" registration rights) to have any securities of the
Parent registered with the SEC or any other governmental authority that would
be superior to or otherwise conflict with the registration rights granted by
Parent pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. \t\t

Listing Requirements \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent's Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act and the Parent Common Stock to be issued hereunder will be
listed on the NYSE upon issuance thereof, and Parent has not taken any action
designed to result in the termination of the registration of Parent's Common
Stock under the Exchange Act or the delisting of Parent's Common Stock from
the NYSE. Parent is in compliance with the applicable listing rules of the
NYSE and has not received any notice from the NYSE asserting any non-
compliance with such rule which has not been resolved prior to the date of
this Agreement. \t\t

Accountants; No Disagreements with Accountants \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent's accounting firm is a registered public accounting firm as
required by the Exchange Act. There are no disagreements presently existing
between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and its independent auditing firms
that would be required to be publicly disclosed. \t\t

Application of Takeover Protections \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent and its board of directors have taken all necessary action,
if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition,
business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights
agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under Parent's certificate
of incorporation (or similar charter documents) or the laws of its state of
incorporation that is or would become applicable as a result of the Parent's
issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

Operations of Merger Sub \t\t

 \t\t\t. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Merger. Merger Sub has engaged in no other business activities and has
conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\t. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Information
Statements or any other similar document provided to Holders in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation
information provided pursuant to Section 280G of the Code as it relates to
payments by Parent, will, at the time it is first published, sent or given to
the Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation
or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference
in the Information Statements based on information supplied by or on behalf of
the Company or its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion in the Information
Statements. \t\t

Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties \t\t

Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives is
making any representation or warranty on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub of any
kind or nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied (including, but
not limited to, any relating to financial condition, results of operations,
prospects, assets or liabilities of the Parent or Merger Sub), and, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
disclaims any and all such other representations and warranties and any
liability based thereon; provided, however, that with respect to claims for
Parent-Related Fraud, the limitation with respect to the representations and
warranties on behalf of Parent and the disclaimer with respect representations
and warranties and any liability based thereon that are set forth in the
preceding portion of this Section 4.21 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
not apply, shall have no effect and shall be disregarded as if it had been

Access to Information and Facilities \t\t

 \t\t\t. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date this Agreement is terminated (the "Interim Period"), the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give Parent and Merger Sub
and Parent's and Merger Sub's representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, facilities, books and records of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall make the officers and employees of the

their representatives, in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with
the normal business operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as Parent,
Merger Sub and their representatives shall from time to time reasonably
request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the Company to
provide access or to disclose any information to Parent if such access or
disclosure would be in violation of applicable Laws (provided that the Company
make alternative arrangements, to the extent permissible, to provide such
access or disclosure in a way that does not violate applicable Laws). If any
of the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.1 includes
material or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened
Litigation or governmental investigations, each party hereto understands and
agrees that the parties hereto have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the
parties hereto that the sharing of such material or information is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or information or its continued protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege. All such information provided by the Company that is entitled to
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these
privileges, this Agreement and the joint defense doctrine. Any information
disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements. \t\t

permitted by this Agreement, (b) with the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
(c) as required by applicable Law, or (d) as set forth in Section 5.2 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its

required under applicable Law and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to

reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in, and following the Closing
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to make, any further necessary
revisions to the Company Financial Statements (and any financial statements
delivered pursuant to the following paragraph) that are necessary to ensure
that such financial statements meet the requirements of Regulation S-X under
the Exchange Act as required to file the Company Financial Statements in a
Current Report on Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form S-3 and
preliminary and final prospectuses included therein necessary for Parent to
register the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the
Merger pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.

consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that meet the requirements of Regulation
S-X under the Exchange Act, such that the foregoing financial statements are
made available to Parent in form and substance sufficient for Parent, using
reasonable efforts after the Closing, to file an amendment to Current Report
on Form 8-K with respect to the Merger within 70 days following the Closing;
provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the covenant to use
reasonable efforts to prepare such financial statements shall not require
completion of such financial statements prior to the Closing, but only that
the Company shall be required to use its reasonable efforts during the
relevant period to ensure that such financial statements are in such a state
that Parent can, using reasonable and ordinary course commercial efforts,
complete such financial statements within the requisite time period for filing
following the Closing.

 \t\t\t. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts (and
take all reasonable actions as may be required) to minimize the amount of
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) with respect to the Merger. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall submit to a vote of the Stockholders of the Company for
their determination all payments or benefits that in the absence of such a
vote could reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" to the extent such
payments exceed 2.99 times the applicable "disqualified individual's" "base
amount" (each within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) (such excess above the base amount, the "Excess
Amounts") made to any such disqualified individuals with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the "280G Vote"). Prior to the 280G Vote, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall obtain waivers as to the right to receive
or retain Excess Amounts from the applicable disqualified individuals. Such
280G Vote shall be carried out pursuant to the procedures and requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, including
disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the
Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder, which disclosure shall be
distributed in a manner consistent with Section 280G of the Code to all
Stockholders eligible to participate in the 280G Vote.  \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (kk) \t\t\tThe parties hereto acknowledge that the Company and
Parent have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreements, which will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
and the provisions of which are by this reference incorporated herein;
provided, however, that the Company and Parent hereby amend the 2013
Confidentiality Agreement to extend the term of the 2013 Confidentiality
Agreement to December 31, 2016 and to include the following sentence "Nothing
in this Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Bidder from making public
statements, disclosures or filings, including the filing of agreements or
other documents as exhibits to filings with the SEC, which are required by
Applicable Law, SEC regulations or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or
are otherwise required to avoid a misstatement or omission under Rule 10b-5 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended." The Company acknowledges
that Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and that any information obtained
by the Company regarding Parent could be considered to be material non-public
information within the meaning of federal and state securities Laws.
Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and agrees not to engage in any
transactions in Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable insider trading
Laws.

issue any press release or make any public statement at any time with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as the Company is
required to by Applicable Law.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (mm) \t\t\tFor six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless the
current officers and directors of the Company and of its Subsidiaries (the
"Covered Persons") to the maximum extent covered by such officers' and
directors' indemnification and exculpation in the Company's Organizational
Documents and indemnification agreements between such persons and the Company,
in each case, that have been delivered to Parent and as in effect immediately
prior to the consummation of the Merger (including fulfilling and honoring all
requirements of the Company under such agreements; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall have any obligation to fulfill
or honor provisions under any agreement that would require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to provide indemnification to any Person in such Person's
capacity as a stockholder of the Company), for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, and for such period of time Parent shall not,
and shall not permit the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to, amend,
repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of the Covered Persons as in effect in the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except as required by applicable Laws. If the Surviving Company or any
of its successors or assigns shall: (x) consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-76-  \t\t

 \t\t

shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (y) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.8(a). No Covered Person shall have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their successors with respect to any Loss claimed by any of the
Indemnified Parties against such Covered Person in his or her capacity as a
Holder pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing will not in any way limit any
Covered Person's rights to coverage under the Runoff DandO Insurance. 

--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (nn) \t\t\tPrior to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall purchase (at Parent's expense) run‑off directors' and
officers' liability insurance that is dedicated to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and not shared with any other entity that is unrelated to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and which shall provide the Covered Persons with
coverage following the Effective Time, and have other terms not materially
less favorable on the whole to the Covered Persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company
(the "Runoff DandO Insurance"); provided that the aggregate cost for such
insurance coverage provided by such Runoff DandO Insurance shall not exceed two
hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium currently paid as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance without Parent's
prior written consent. If the cost of the Runoff DandO Insurance would require
an expenditure that exceeds such amount and Parent does not so consent, the
Company shall obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount.

Indemnitees, and their respective heirs and legal representatives, it being
expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this

rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights

contract or otherwise.

Information Statements and Appraisal Notice \t\t

 \t\t\t. No later than two (2) Business Days after the date of the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and mail (i) the Information
Statements to all Stockholders of record and (ii) an appraisal notice pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL to any holder of Company Capital Stock that has not
consented to this Agreement and the Merger that complies with applicable Laws,
in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent. \t\t

Financing \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing
on the terms and conditions described therein including using reasonable best
efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt  \t\t

 \t\t

Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Financing Agreements") on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or, if available, on other
terms (to the extent they are less favorable to Parent) that are acceptable to
Parent and would not adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and (iii) to satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter (other
than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of
the Company's failure to comply with its obligations under Section 5.11), and
to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub
shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers
of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter without
the prior written consent of the Company to the extent such amendments,
modifications or waivers would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Financing to fund the
amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement below
the amount of Parent's cash and cash equivalents and Cash on Hand at the
Company which, in the aggregate, is sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company to, on and after the date of the Closing, pay the aggregate
Common Per Share Cash Amount, or (B) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent or delay or impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to enforce its rights (including through litigation) against the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
give the Company prompt notice (x) of any actual or alleged breach or default
by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, (y) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any actual or alleged breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements or any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Financing Agreement, or (z) if Parent and Merger Sub determine in good faith
that they will not be able to satisfy any of the obligations to, or otherwise
be able to obtain, some or any portion of the Financing prior to the
Termination Date. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence or if any portion
of the Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably
required to fund the cash portion of the Estimated Purchase Price, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
in an amount that, when combined with the amount of Parent's cash and cash
equivalents, is sufficient for Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company
to, on and after the date of the Closing, pay the Estimated Purchase Price on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
Company or Parent than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the flex provisions thereof). Any reference in this Agreement to
(1) the "Financing" shall also include any such alternative financing, (2) the
"Debt Commitment Letter" shall also include the definitive agreements with
respect to any such alternative financing, (3) the "Financing Agreements"
shall also include the definitive agreements with respect to any such
alternative financing and (4) the "Financing Sources" shall also include the
financing institutions contemplated to provide any such alternative
financing. \t\t

Financing Assistance \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries'
officers, directors,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-78-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

employees, agents, and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
to, provide all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent to assist
Parent and Merger Sub in the arrangement and consummation of the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter for the purpose of funding the
payment of the Purchase Price (the "Financing"), including but not limited to
(i) promptly furnishing to Parent and the Financing Sources such financial,
marketing and other information and materials relating to the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries that is customary or necessary for the completion of the
Financing, or for the preparation of offering or information documents to be
used in connection with the same; (ii) cooperating with the marketing efforts
of Parent and the Financing Sources, including participation in meetings with,
and delivering management reports to, the Persons acting as lead arrangers or
agents for the prospective lenders and purchasers of the Financing, and
attending presentations, roadshows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing; (iii)
delivering (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited
statements of comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Audited Annual Financials") for each
of the two most recently ended fiscal years that have ended at least ninety
(90) days prior to the Closing Date, and (B) unaudited consolidated balance
sheets and related unaudited statements of comprehensive income (loss) and
cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Quarterly Financials")
for each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2015
and for any subsequent fiscal quarter that ends forty-five (45) or more
calendar days prior to the Closing Date; (iv) causing the Company's
independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to Parent consistent
with their customary practice (including to consent to the use of their audit
reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any materials relating to the Financing); (v) using reasonable
best efforts to assist Parent in connection with the preparation of pro forma
financial information and financial statements necessary or reasonably
required by the Financing Sources; (vi) upon reasonable request of Parent and
to the extent the same become necessary or advisable in connection with the
Financing, assisting Parent to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and
approvals from other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including by arranging
discussions among Parent, the Company and the Financing Sources and their
respective representatives with other parties to such material leases,
encumbrances and contracts; provided, that such documents will not take
effect until, and will be conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time); and (vii) to the extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
to be party to the Financing following the occurrence of the Effective Time,
(A) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary legal opinions and
executing and delivering customary closing certificates and documents at or
prior to the Closing as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the Financing; provided, that such documents will not take effect until,
and will be conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time; (B) using
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the execution and delivery at or prior
to the Closing of definitive documents (including loan agreements, customary
guarantee documentation (if applicable) and other applicable loan documents)
related to the Financing; provided, that such documents will not take effect
until, and will be conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time; and
(C) to the extent requested reasonably in advance, providing to the Financing
Sources, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all
customary and reasonable documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities with respect to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries under applicable "know your customer" and anti‑money laundering
rules and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-79-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended. Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would (i) require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse
any expenses or give any indemnities, (ii) require the Company to incur any
other liability or obligation prior to the Effective Time, (iii) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, or (iv) cause any
condition to Closing set forth in Article VI to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement. Parent agrees, promptly upon
request, to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of their
reasonable, documented, out‑of‑pocket costs, fees and expenses (including fees
and disbursements of counsel) actually incurred in connection with the
Financing promptly following the incurrence thereof (limited, in the case of
any costs, fees and expenses for preparing the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries described in clause (iii) of
the immediately preceding sentence, to the incremental costs, fees and
expenses for preparing the Audited Annual Financials and Quarterly Financials
in excess of the costs, fees and expenses of preparing the corresponding
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the most recent
fiscal year and most recent fiscal quarter ended prior to the date hereof).
The Company, its Affiliates and their respective representatives shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Parent for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (other than arising out of or resulting from
Company-Related Fraud, gross negligence of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company's breach of or failure to perform a covenant in
this Agreement or breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the
Company in this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws
and with appropriate contribution to the extent such indemnification is not
available. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing, provided such logos are
used in a customary manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein or in the Confidentiality Agreements, Parent shall be
permitted to share all information subject to such agreements with its
potential financing sources, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings
by such potential financing sources with respect thereto. \t\t

Certain Employment and Benefits Matters \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (pp) \t\t\tDuring the period from the Closing Date until the
12-month anniversary thereof, Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to,
provide to each individual who is employed (including co-employed by the
Company and TriNet) by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to
Closing (the "Company Employees") with base salary or hourly wage rate and
bonus opportunities no less favorable than those provided to such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date; notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent or its Affiliates shall have full discretion to terminate
the employment of any such Company Employees within such 12-month period for
any reason. In addition, with respect to the health and welfare benefit plans
provided by TriNet, the Company and its Affiliates to Company Employees in
effect as of the Closing Date, Parent or its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to continue such health and welfare benefit plans through
September 30, 2016, including health flexible spending account plans and
existing balances thereunder, and allow for Company Employees' (and their
eligible dependents') participation for the  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-80-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

remainder of such period ending September 30, 2016 in such plans on the same
terms as in effect as of the Closing Date, provided, however, that in the
event that such participation cannot be continued or is discontinued, Parent
or one or more of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate participation by Company Employees (and their eligible dependents)
in such health and welfare benefit plans as Parent or such Affiliate makes
available to its other U.S. based employees. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (qq) \t\t\tEffective as of the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, cause each compensation or employee benefit plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates and in which any Company
Employee becomes eligible to participate, to treat the prior service of such
Company Employee with any of the Company and its Affiliates as service
rendered to Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be, for purposes of
vesting, eligibility and levels of benefits, but not for purposes of vesting
under any equity compensation plan, to the extent that such service crediting
does not violate any applicable Laws or result in duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (rr) \t\t\tParent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (i)
waive all limitations on health and welfare benefits coverage of any Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions
and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements, and requirements to
show evidence of good health under the applicable health and welfare plan of
Parent or any of its Affiliates to the extent that such Company Employee and
his or her eligible dependents are covered under any Benefit Plan that is a
health and welfare benefit plan, and such conditions, periods or requirements
are satisfied or waived under such plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) credit each Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents with
all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents prior to the Closing Date under any
Benefit Plan that is a medical employee benefit plan, for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such Company Employee and his or her
dependents have satisfied their deductibles and whether they have reached the
out-of-pocket maximums under any medical plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates; provided, however, that such crediting shall only apply with
respect to amounts paid by or on behalf of such Company Employee and his or
her dependents during the plan year of the Parent's (or Affiliates', as
applicable) medical plan in which the Closing Date occurs. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ss) \t\t\tFor purposes of determining the number of paid time off
("PTO") days to which each Company Employee shall be entitled during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall assume and honor
all PTO days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Company Employee as
of the Closing Date. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (tt) \t\t\tThe Company shall terminate its participation in the
TriNet 401(k) Plan (through Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company)
(the "Company 401(k) Plan") prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the
Closing. Parent shall allow each Company Employee who participated in the
Company 401(k) Plan as of the date on which the Company's participation in
such plan terminated to participate, effective no later than thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, in a defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or
any of its Affiliates that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
that includes an arrangement described in Section 401(k) of the Code  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-81-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

(the "Parent 401(k) Plan") and to be permitted to elect to make a rollover of
such employee's account balance (including outstanding participants loans,
which may be rolled over in kind as long as the entire account balance is
rolled over) under the Company 401(k) Plan to an account under the Parent
401(k) Plan.

 \t\t\t\t (uu) \t\t\tThe provisions of this Section 5.12 are for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other
current or former employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, other than
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the
matters provided for in this Section 5.12) under or by reason of any provision
of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall amend, or be deemed to
amend (or prevent the amendment or termination of) any Benefit Plan or any
compensation or benefit plan of the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates. Except as specifically provided in this Section 5.12,
Parent shall be entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to,
and any other terms or conditions of employment of, any such employees in its
absolute discretion.

Merger Consideration Table \t\t

 \t\t\t. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing the
Company shall deliver to Parent and the Exchange Agent for their review and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the Merger Consideration Table, which shall be deemed final upon
approval of the same by Parent and the Exchange Agent. The Company retains
responsibility at all times for ensuring the accuracy of such Merger
Consideration Table and the review and approval by Parent and the Exchange
Agent shall not constitute a representation to any Person by Parent or the
Exchange Agent that the information provided by the Company in the Merger
Consideration Table is accurate. \t\t

Tax Matters \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (vv) \t\t\tParent shall prepare and file or cause to be filed,
subject to the review and reasonable approval of the Stockholders'
Representative, all Tax Returns for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in good
faith in a manner that is consistent with the past custom and practice of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, except as required by applicable Laws. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (ww) \t\t\tParent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed, subject to the review and reasonable approval of the
Stockholders' Representative, any Tax Returns of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (xx) \t\t\tIn the case of any Straddle Period: (i) in the case of
a Tax that is based on net or gross income, the amount of any Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
taxable period ended on the Closing Date, (ii) in the case of a Tax that is
based on a specific event or transaction, the amount of any Taxes for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-82-  \t\t

 \t\t

Period shall be determined based on the actual date of such event or
transaction, and (iii) the amount of other Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period. Any credits relating to a Straddle
Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended
on the Closing Date. For any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, the entire amount of Taxes payable by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to such period shall be allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the prior
practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless a
different treatment is required by applicable Laws.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (yy) \t\t\tParent, the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative agree that to the extent permitted by Law, any deductions
relating to the payment of bonuses, option cancellation payments, repayment of
Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other Transaction
Costs or (to the extent complying with the safe harbor set forth in Rev. Proc.
2011-29) success-based fees in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be included as deductions of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the relevant Tax Returns for Tax periods ending on or before
the Closing Date. Except to the extent attributable to any Tax attribute
generated after the Closing Date or to the extent included as current assets
in calculating Working Capital, any refunds (or credits for overpayment) of
Taxes, including any interest received from a Taxing Authority thereon,
attributable to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Holders
(including any refunds that can arise as a result of a change in Law that
occurs after the Closing Date but that can affect a Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date, e.g., retroactive changes to depreciation provisions
in the Code). Promptly upon the Surviving Company's (or any of its
Affiliates' or Subsidiaries') receipt of any such refund (or use of a credit
for overpayment), Parent shall pay over, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, any such refund (or the amount of any such credit so used) to
the Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock) and
Parent's or the Surviving Company's payroll administrator (in the case of
holders of Company Options and participants in the Transaction Bonus Pool),
for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares and subject to prior compliance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.9. Parent shall take any action reasonably necessary or reasonably
requested by the Stockholders' Representative (including filing IRS Form 1139
and any corresponding form for applicable state, local and foreign tax
purposes and filing amended Tax Returns to the extent necessary) for the
Surviving Company, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to promptly claim
refunds attributable to or with respect to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date (including any refunds that can arise as a result of a change
in Law that occurs after the Closing Date but that can affect a Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date, e.g., retroactive changes to
depreciation provisions in the Code).

with any interest, penalties or additions to such transfer taxes or
attributable to any failure to comply with any requirement regarding Tax
Returns ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by Parent, subject to Section
3.15(t). Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall cooperate in filing
all necessary Tax Returns under applicable Laws with respect to Transfer
Taxes.

 \t\t\t\t (aaa) \t\t\tParent shall inform the Stockholders' Representative
of the commencement of any Tax Proceeding relating in whole or in part to
Taxes for which Parent may be entitled to indemnity from the Holders
hereunder. With respect to any Tax Proceeding for which the Stockholders'
Representative acknowledges in writing that the Holders are liable under
Article IX for all Losses relating thereto, the Stockholders' Representative
shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all proceedings taken in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that (y) in the case
of a Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the Stockholders' Representative and
Parent shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such
Tax Proceeding and (z) if any Tax Proceeding could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, the Tax
Proceeding shall not be settled or resolved without Parent's consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure of Parent
to give reasonably prompt notice of any Tax Proceeding shall not release,
waive or otherwise affect the Stockholders Indemnitors' obligations with
respect thereto except to the extent that the Stockholders' Representative can
demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Parent and
the Surviving Company shall use their reasonable efforts to provide the
Stockholders' Representative with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the Stockholders' Representative in connection with a Tax
Proceeding controlled solely or jointly by the Stockholders' Representative.

 \t\t\t\t (bbb) \t\t\tParent and the Stockholders' Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
(i) the filing of Tax Returns, (ii) any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii) the preparation of any
financial statements to the extent related to Taxes. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Stockholders' Representative shall have
no obligation to prepare or file any Tax Returns.

Release and Waiver \t\t

 \t\t\t. Effective as of the Effective Time, in consideration for Parent's
acceptance of the limitations on Parent's right to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.4, each Holder, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, agents,
representatives, attorneys, successors, assigns, dependents, heirs, executors,
and administrators, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally forever releases,
acquits and discharges the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Company
and Parent (and any of their respective predecessors, successors, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, attorneys, assigns,
dependents, heirs, executors, and administrators) from any and all claims,
rights, demands, actions, suits, damages, losses, expenses, liabilities,
indebtedness, and causes of action, of whatever kind or nature that existed or
arose from the beginning of time through the Effective Time, regardless of
whether known or unknown, and regardless of whether asserted to date
(excluding the claims that are not released pursuant to the following
sentence, the "Released Holder Claims"). The foregoing shall not constitute a
release of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-84-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

claims with respect to (i) payments to such Holder of any portion of the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Per Share Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration, the Per Option Merger Consideration, or portion of the
Transaction Bonus Plan, as applicable, to which such Holder is expressly
entitled pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii) if such
Holder is a Covered Person, any claims that such Holder may have for
indemnification under (A) the Runoff Insurance Policy or any similar "tail"
insurance policy, (B) the Company's or any Subsidiary's Organizational
Documents, (C) any indemnification agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to such Holder's service as an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (D) Section 5.8 of
this Agreement, other than indemnification agreements or arrangements with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing indemnification of such
Holder in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, as to which the
foregoing release shall constitute a release of claims, (iii) if such Holder
is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, any claims for compensation
for services actually provided by such Holder during the most recent pay
period prior to the Closing, including salary, benefits and reimbursements of
expenses incurred and otherwise reimbursable in accordance with the Company's
or any of its Subsidiaries' policies during such period, (iv) to the extent
that such Holder is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, any claims
for compensation payable or benefits due with respect to any offer letter,
employment agreement or arrangement, or any equity incentive plan or
agreement. Such Holder further agrees and covenants not to participate in any
action or proceeding against the Company or the Surviving Company based upon
any of the Released Holder Claims, and (v) claims arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
claims related to ownership of Parent Common Stock or which may not otherwise
be released as a matter of applicable Laws. Each Holder (a) understands that
the release contained in this Section 5.15 is binding on such Holder and its
Affiliates, agents, representatives, attorneys, assigns, dependents, heirs,
executors, and administrators, (b) represents and warrants that (i) it has had
the opportunity to consult with counsel of its choice, (ii) it is fully
informed of the nature and contents of this release and (iii) it has entered
into this release freely and without any threat or coercion whatsoever and (c)
further agrees and covenants not to participate in any action or proceeding
against the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Company or the Parent
based upon any of the Released Holder Claims. \t\t

nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction specified
in Section 10.15 with respect to such matter shall be binding and conclusive
upon the parties hereto as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Notice of Claim and (i) in the case of claims by a Parent Indemnitee, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such judgment and the
Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Indemnification Escrow Account in
accordance therewith, and (ii) in the case of claims by a Stockholder
Indemnitee, Parent shall act in accordance with such judgment and pay the
Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock) and Parent's
or the Surviving Company's, as applicable, payroll administrator (in the case
of holders of Company Options and participants in the Transaction Bonus Pool),
for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares and subject to prior compliance with the procedures set forth in

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tThird Party Claims.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t(i) \t\t\tNotice. With respect to any matter for which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from an Indemnifying Party
under this Article IX that relates to a claim by a Person who (a) is not a
party to this Agreement, (b) is not an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement
and (c) is not a successor to a party to this Agreement or any of its
Affiliates (a "Third Party" and such claim a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide to the Indemnifying Party a Notice of
Claim relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that no failure
or delay in providing such Notice of Claim shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-94-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

liability hereunder (except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered
actual prejudice thereby). 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(ii) \t\t\tAssumption of the Defense. Parent shall be entitled to
assume and control all aspects of the defense of Third Party Claims, including
the selection of legal counsel, subject to the obligations set forth in this
Agreement. Provided that the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Parties
shall have first executed a customary joint defense agreement, Parent shall
thereafter (A) promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material
developments related to such Third Party Claim and copy the Stockholders'
Representative on all pleadings, filings and other correspondence relating
thereto, and (B) consult with, and consider in good faith the recommendations
of, the Stockholders' Representative regarding the strategy for defense of
such Third Party Claim. With respect to such Third Party Claim: (x) the
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right at its sole cost and
expense, but not the obligation, to participate in (without any right to
control) the defense of such Third Party Claim through legal counsel selected
by it, but the costs and expenses of such legal counsel shall be borne solely
by the Stockholders' Representative; provided that all costs and expenses
borne pursuant to this Section 9.3(b) shall be borne by the Holders acting
through the Stockholders' Representative in its capacity as such; and (y)
Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, (1) reasonably cooperate with, (2)
make their respective relevant files and records reasonably available for
inspection and copying by, (3) make their respective employees reasonably
available to, and (4) otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the other
Person in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tRefusal or Failure to Defend a Third Party Claim. If
Parent refused or failed to control the defense of a Third Party Claim or
unreasonably delays in performing its obligations to assume control or defend
such Thirty Party Claim at any time after an Indemnified Party submits a
Notice of Claim of such Third Party Claim, the Stockholders' Representative
shall be entitled to fully assume, commence and pursue the defense of such
Third Party Claim and Parent shall no longer be entitled to defend such Third
Party Claim. From and after the assumption of the control of the defense of
such Third Party Claim pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, with
respect to such Third Party Claim, the Stockholders' Representative shall have
all rights and obligations of Parent, and Parent shall have all rights and
obligations of the Stockholders' Representative, set forth in this Section
9.3(b) (other than Section 9.3(b)(iv)(2) and (b)(iv)(3) and the right of
Parent to request the release from the Indemnification Escrow Account (which
right shall remain with Parent) of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 9.3(b)(iv)(1)) with respect to control of such Third
Party Claim. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iv) \t\t\tSettlement. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (1) \t\t\tIf Parent proposes to settle or compromise such Third
Party Claim, Parent shall provide notice to that effect (together with a
statement describing in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such
settlement or compromise and including a copy of the settlement agreement) to
the Stockholders' Representative, which notice shall be provided a reasonable
time prior to the proposed time for effecting such settlement or compromise.
Prior to  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-95-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

settling or compromising any such Third Party Claim, Parent shall obtain the
written consent of the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders'
Representative shall not withhold, condition or delay such consent
unreasonably. If Parent effects any such settlement or compromise of such
Third Party Claim with the written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative, the cash amount payable pursuant to such settlement or
compromise plus the related indemnifiable Losses, if any, specified in such
consent shall, if requested by Parent in its sole discretion, be released from
the Indemnification Escrow Account. 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (2) \t\t\tIf Parent effects any such settlement or compromise of
such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative, then unless such consent was withheld, conditioned or delayed
unreasonably by the Stockholders' Representative, as the Stockholders'
Representative's exclusive remedy with respect to Parent's settlement or
compromise of such Third Party Claim without the Stockholders'
Representative's consent, if the cash payment obligations pursuant to such
settlement or compromise constitute indemnifiable Losses for which Parent (or
the Indemnified Parties it represents) may be entitled to indemnification, is
for the Stockholders' Representative to seek monetary damages from Parent (but
not injunctive relief or other equitable relief seeking to prevent or unwind
such settlement or compromise) equal to the amount by which such cash payment
obligations for which the Indemnifying Parties must indemnify the Indemnified
Parties exceed the amount reasonably required for Parent to effect such
settlement or compromise, taking into account all relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of such settlement or compromise and the reasonably
foreseeable implications of delaying or failing to achieve the settlement or
compromise when effected. The Stockholders' Representative shall not seek
injunctive relief or other equitable relief seeking to prevent or unwind such
settlement or compromise. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree
that the limitations on the Stockholders' Representative's remedies pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence are acceptable and were agreed to in
exchange for the willingness of the parties to this Agreement to accept the
rights and procedures set forth in this Section 9.3(b), and the Stockholders'
Representative shall not seek any such equitable relief, including injunctive
relief, or otherwise to attempt to prevent or unwind the settlement or
compromise of a Third Party Claim. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (3) \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the consent of Parent to any settlement or compromise of a Third
Party Claim may be withheld by Parent in its sole discretion; provided that
Parent's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in
the event any such settlement is on exclusively monetary terms to be fully
funded from the Indemnification Escrow Account and includes an unconditional
release of Parent and its Affiliates from all liability arising out of such
Third Party Claim. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tDistribution of Escrow. On or before the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Escrow Agent will release and deliver from the Indemnification Escrow Account,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent (in the
case of holders of Company Capital Stock) and Parent's or the Surviving
Company's, as applicable, payroll administrator (in the case of holders of
Company Options and participants in the Transaction Bonus Pool), for further
distribution to the Holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and
subject to prior compliance with the requirements, conditions and procedures
set forth in  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

Section 2.9, that portion of the Indemnification Escrow Account then remaining
in the Indemnification Escrow Account, if any, in excess of any amounts in the
Indemnification Escrow Account reserved in respect of pending and unresolved
claims pursuant to this Agreement, including for indemnification which have
been submitted pursuant to this Article IX. The Escrow Agent shall continue
to hold any amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account following
such distribution in accordance with the Escrow Agreement until the claims
underlying the amounts held in the Indemnification Escrow Account are resolved
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.3, and shall
distribute any amounts remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account in
accordance with this paragraph upon final resolution of such claims.

Company Fundamental Representation or (B) Company-Related Fraud, in which case
the limitation in this Section 9.4(a)(i) shall not apply; 

---|--- 

 \t\t

as to which the limitation of this Section 9.4(a)(ii) shall not apply) unless
and until the aggregate amount of such Losses meets or exceeds an amount equal
to $1,300,000, in which case the Parent Indemnitees shall thereafter be
entitled to all such Losses (including the first $1,300,000 of Losses and
subject to, if applicable, Sections 9.4(a)(iii), 9.4(a)(iv) and 9.4(a)(v),
all Losses in excess thereof); 

---|--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(iii) \t\t\tthe Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification for Losses from the Holders pursuant to Section 9.1(b) to the
extent such Losses exceed the amounts then held in the Indemnification Escrow

Fraud, in which case the limitation in this Section 9.4(a)(iii) shall not
apply;

nonfulfillment or intentional failure to perform, (B) claims pursuant to
Sections 9.1(e), 9.1(h) and 9.1(i), (C) a breach or inaccuracy of a Company
Fundamental Representation, or (D) Company-Related Fraud, in each case as to
which the limitation in this Section 9.4(a)(iv) shall not apply, the Parent
Indemnitees shall look first to the Indemnification Escrow Account for the
satisfaction of all indemnified Losses pursuant to Section 9.1, and only after
all of the amounts originally deposited in the Indemnification Escrow Account
have been distributed from the Indemnification Escrow Account or are otherwise
subject to  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-97-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

claims for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, shall any Parent
Indemnitee be permitted to recover any such indemnified Losses from the
Holders directly (which in any event shall be allocated severally in
accordance with each Holder's respective Pro Rata Share); provided, however,
that for Losses arising out of or resulting from claims pursuant to Sections
9.1(f) or 9.1(g), (x) subject to clause (y) of this sentence, the Parent
Indemnitees shall look first to the Indemnification Escrow Account for the
satisfaction of only the first $200,000 of the aggregate indemnified Losses
pursuant to Sections 9.1(f) and 9.1(g) (collectively, the "Threshold Amount")
and the Parent Indemnitees shall be permitted to recover any indemnified
Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount from the Holders directly (which in
any event shall be allocated severally in accordance with each Holder's
respective Pro Rata Share), and (y) to the extent the Parent Indemnitees are
not able to recover the Threshold Amount from the Indemnification Escrow
Account because it has been exhausted or contains less than the Threshold
Amount in funds that are not otherwise subject to claims for indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent Indemnitees shall be permitted to
recover any such indemnified Losses from the Holders directly (which in any
event shall be allocated severally in accordance with each Holder's respective
Pro Rata Share); and 

--- 

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t(v) \t\t\tnotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the aggregate indemnification obligations of any Holder pursuant to
this Agreement shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to the total
consideration actually received by such Holder under this Agreement; provided,
however, that the value of the Parent Common Stock received by the Holders
under this Agreement shall be valued at the Reference Price for purposes of
this Article IX.

until the aggregate amount of such Losses meets or exceeds an amount equal to

Agreement, or (ii) with respect to any failure of a Holder to have good and

 \t\t\t. All materiality qualifications contained in the representations and
warranties of the parties to this Agreement set forth in this Agreement
(however they may be phrased and including the term "Company Material Adverse

occurred and, if such breach or inaccuracy has occurred, all such materiality
qualifications shall be ignored and not given any effect for purposes of
determining the amount of Losses arising out of,  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (n) \t\t\tCertain Holders have entered into an engagement
agreement with the Stockholders' Representative to provide direction to the
Stockholders' Representative in connection with the performance of its
services under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Holders,
including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred
to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the Stockholders' Representative nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Representative Group"),
shall be liable to any Holders arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholders' Representative's duties
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under any Stockholders'
Representative engagement agreement, in each case,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-108-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holders appointing the
Stockholders' Representative do hereby severally (in accordance with their Pro
Rata Share) agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Representative Group
harmless from and against any and all Liability, claim, loss, cost, damage,
judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement, fee or expense (including fees,
disbursements and costs of attorneys and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) (collectively, the
"Representative Expenses") reasonably incurred or suffered as a result of the
performance of such Stockholders' Representative's duties under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement except for any such Liability arising out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders' Representative. Such
Representative Expenses may be recovered first, from the Expense Fund, second,
from any consideration being distributed to the Holders from the
Indemnification Escrow Account and the Adjustment Reserve, and third, directly
from the Holders. The Holders acknowledge that the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or administration of its duties.
Furthermore, the Stockholders' Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless the Stockholders' Representative has been provided with
funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to
protect the Stockholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in
performing such actions. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Representative or any
member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (o) \t\t\tUpon the Closing, Parent shall wire to the Stockholders'
Representative $100,000.00 (the "Administrative Expense Amount"). The
Administrative Expense Amount shall be held by the Stockholders'
Representative as agent and for the benefit of the Holders in a segregated
non-interest-bearing client account and shall be used (i) for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Representative for, any
Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement or any
Stockholders' Representative letter agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined
by the Advisory Group (the "Expense Fund"). The Stockholders' Representative
is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and
shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Stockholders' Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has
no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder. The
Stockholders' Representative is authorized to replenish the Expense Fund from
any consideration being distributed to the Holders or to reserve such
additional amounts as the Stockholders' Representative deems necessary in its
discretion. As soon as reasonably determined by the Stockholders'
Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the
Stockholders' Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund (if
any) to the Exchange Agent (in the case of holders of Company Capital Stock)
and Parent's or the Surviving Company's, as applicable, payroll administrator
(in the case of holders of Company Options and participants in the Transaction
Bonus Pool), for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares and subject to prior compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 2.9.

provisions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. \t\t

Disclosure Letters \t\t

 \t\t\t. Disclosure in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the indicated
Section of this Agreement, except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to or
relevant to another Section of this Agreement. The inclusion of information
in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed as an admission that such information is material to any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or to any of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. In addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to matters required
by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-111-  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and shall not be
construed as an admission of liability or responsibility under any Law or in
any dispute or controversy. \t\t

Severability \t\t

 \t\t\t. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction specified in Section 10.15
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible. \t\t

Construction \t\t

 \t\t\t. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually chosen
by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Laws shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. \t\t

Attorney‑Client Privilege \t\t

 \t\t\t.  \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (r) \t\t\tAndrews Kurth LLP ("Company Party Counsel") has acted as
counsel, and until the Effective time will act as counsel, for the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Stockholders' Representative (together, the "Company
Parties") in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Acquisition Engagement"), and, in that connection, not as counsel
for any other Person, including, without limitation, Parent or any of its
Affiliates. Each of the Company, the Stockholders' Representative, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees, and Affiliates to all of
the matters set forth in this section. 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\t\t (s) \t\t\tOnly the Company Parties shall be considered clients of
Company Party Counsel in the Acquisition Engagement. To the extent that
communications since October 1, 2013 (the "Engagement Date"), between a
Company Party, on the one hand, and Company Party Counsel, on the other hand,
relate to the Acquisition Engagement, such communication shall be deemed to be
attorney‑client confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders'
Representative, for and on behalf of the Holders, and not the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates, including the
Surviving Company, shall have access to (and each hereby waives any right of
access it may otherwise have with respect to) any such communications or the
files or work product of Company Party Counsel since the Engagement Date, to
the extent that they relate to the  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t-112-  \t\t
   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates, including the
Surviving Company, acknowledge and agree, upon and after the Closing, unless
the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Acquisition Engagement is
otherwise relinquished: (i) the Stockholders' Representative, for and on
behalf of the Holders, and Company Party Counsel shall be the sole holders of
the attorney‑client privilege with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, and
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Company,
shall be a holder thereof; (ii) to the extent that files or work product of
Company Party Counsel in respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute
property of the client, only the Stockholders' Representative for and on
behalf of the Holders, shall hold such property rights and have the right to
waive or modify such property rights; and (iii) except as set forth in Section
9.3, neither Parent or any of its Affiliates has the authority to compel
Company Party Counsel to reveal or disclose any such attorney‑client
communications, files or work product to Parent or any of its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Company, by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Company Party Counsel and the Company, any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that, (x) to the extent any communication is both related
and unrelated to the Acquisition Engagement, Company Party Counsel shall
provide (and the Stockholders' Representative, for and on behalf of the
Holders, shall instruct Company Party Counsel to provide) appropriately
redacted versions of such communications, files or work product to Parent, and
(y) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Holders, the
Stockholders' Representative (for and on behalf of the Holders), or Company
Party Counsel shall waive or modify the attorney-client privilege or, in the
case of Company Party Counsel files or work product, other confidentiality or
property rights, with respect to the Acquisition Engagement without the prior
written consent of Parent or the Surviving Company.
