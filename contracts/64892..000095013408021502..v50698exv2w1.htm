promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten business days) after the date of this
Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), the Offer. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent
to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;Offer
Conditions&#148;). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time, on
the 20th business day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion,
waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;reduce
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price,
(iii)&nbsp;change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv)&nbsp;add to the conditions set forth in
Exhibit&nbsp;A or modify any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock,
(v)&nbsp;except as otherwise provided in this Section&nbsp;1.01(a), extend the Offer, (vi)&nbsp;change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (vii)&nbsp;otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
without limiting Parent&#146;s or Sub&#146;s obligations under the following sentence, Sub (A)&nbsp;may, in its
sole discretion, without consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for any
period, if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not
be satisfied or, in Sub&#146;s sole discretion, waived, until such time as such condition or conditions
are satisfied or waived and (B)&nbsp;shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in no event shall
Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Parent and Sub agree that (A)&nbsp;if,
on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions set forth in
clauses (ii)&nbsp;through (vi)&nbsp;of Exhibit&nbsp;A is not satisfied or, in Sub&#146;s sole discretion, waived, then
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive
increments of up to ten business days each, until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied
or, in Sub&#146;s sole discretion, waived and (B)&nbsp;if, on any then-scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied but all of the other Offer Conditions set
forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A are satisfied or, in Sub&#146;s sole discretion, waived, then Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer as provided by the terms of Section&nbsp;8.01(f); <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that in no event shall Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination
Date. On the terms and subject to

accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of tax pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.01(d)) all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with this Section&nbsp;1.01(a)). Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is referred
to in this Agreement as the &#147;Offer Closing&#148;, and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;Offer Closing Date&#148;. Sub expressly reserves the right to, in
its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a &#147;subsequent offering
period&#148; in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents may, in

included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the &#147;Offer Documents&#148;), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company as and to the extent required by Federal securities laws. The Company
shall promptly after the date hereof furnish to Parent and Sub all information concerning the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so
amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent
and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly
provide the Company with copies of all correspondence and summaries of all material oral
