 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of December 1, 2008, among JOHNSON and JOHNSON, a New Jersey corporation ("Parent"), MAPLE MERGER SUB, INC., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and MENTOR CORPORATION, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $31.00 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the "Offer Price") net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Sub shall, in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA"), merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), pursuant to which each share of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company and (ii) the Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash; 

  

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Sub has approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (i) has determined that the Offer and the Merger are advisable and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) has approved this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (iii) is recommending that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and, to the extent required by applicable law, approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.  ##### 

 

 

2  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Offer_   

  

 SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten business days) after the date of this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time, on the 20th business day following the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), extend the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and without limiting Parents or Subs obligations under the following sentence, Sub (A) may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions for any period, if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or, in Subs sole discretion, waived, until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived and (B) shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Parent and Sub agree that (A) if, on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (ii) through (vi) of Exhibit A is not satisfied or, in Subs sole discretion, waived, then Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten business days each, until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied or, in Subs sole discretion, waived and (B) if, on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied but all of the other Offer Conditions set forth in Exhibit A are satisfied or, in Subs sole discretion, waived, then Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer as provided by the terms of Section 8.01(f); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Sub be required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. On the terms and subject to  ##### 

 

 

3   

the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of tax pursuant
to Section 1.01(d)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the
expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended
in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)). Acceptance for payment of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer
upon the expiration of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Closing", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date". Sub expressly reserves the
right to, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the
Offer for a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents may, in Subs sole discretion,
provide for such a reservation of right. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.01(a) shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII. 

  

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the shareholders of the Company as and to the extent required by Federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly after the date hereof furnish to Parent and Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent and Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence and summaries of all material oral communications between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. 

  

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Sub to fulfill all of Subs obligations under this Agreement.  ##### 

 

 

4  

 (d) Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (e) Sub shall timely file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota a registration statement related to the Offer required to be filed pursuant to Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes (the "Minnesota Registration Statement") and shall disseminate the Minnesota Registration Statement as required by Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes. Sub shall promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota all materials referred to in Section 80B.04 of the Minnesota Statutes that Parent and Sub file with the SEC or otherwise make available to the shareholders of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the recommendation described in Section 4.01(d) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company as required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence and summaries of all material oral communications between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to  ##### 

 

 

5   

any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof),
and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company contained in the
Schedule 14D-9. 

  

 (c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Parent and Sub promptly after the date hereof with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of shareholders, security position listings and computer files and all other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of shareholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 14, 2007, as amended on May 7, 2008 and as further amended on September 4, 2008, between Ethicon, Inc. and the Company (as it may be further amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control. 

  

 (d) The Company shall promptly file with the Commissioner of Commerce of the State of Minnesota all materials referred to in Section 80B.04 of the Minnesota Statutes that the Company files with the SEC or otherwise makes available to the shareholders of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 1.03. _Top-Up Option._ (a)The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a "fully diluted basis" (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued or held in the treasury of the Company (giving effect to  ##### 

 

 

6   

the shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding
stock options, restricted stock units and any other rights to acquire Company
Common Stock as if such shares were outstanding) or (ii) 19.90% of the number
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or voting power of the Company,
in each case as of immediately prior to and after giving effect to
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable at
any one time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of
(a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The obligation of the Company to issue and
deliver the Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject
only to the condition that no Restraint preventing the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such
exercise shall be in effect. 

  

 (b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. In the event Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give the Company at least three business days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company (i) in cash, by wire transfer or cashiers check or (ii) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a promissory note on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

  

 (c) Parent and Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities laws.

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 SECTION 3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and the Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As provided in Section 3.02(h), the right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law. 

  

 (d) _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by any person who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares ("Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the "Dissenter Rights Statutes"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenter Rights Statutes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Dissenter Rights Statutes, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to  ##### 

 

 

9   

receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.01(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company in accordance with the
Dissenter Rights Statutes, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served on the Company in relation to the Dissenting Shares or
rights under the Dissenter Rights Statutes, and Purchaser shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such
demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 3.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare Inc. or another comparable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article III. No  ##### 

 

 

10   

interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. 

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent for any reason, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article III. 

  

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III. 

  

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

  

 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or any other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any  ##### 

 

 

11   

payments made in respect of the Dissenting Shares) to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (i) _Tax Treatment._ The parties agree and acknowledge that the Merger will be treated as a taxable purchase of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (and not as a reorganization, within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code) for United States federal, state and local income tax purposes. 

  

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _Representations and Warranties_   

  

 SECTION 4.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such disclosure letter relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any information set forth in one section of such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is readily apparent on the face of such information) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows: 

  

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good standing (in the jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and has all requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing, have such power or authority or possess such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations or approvals, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be  ##### 

 

 

12   

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement, complete and accurate
copies of the Company Certificate and its Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws"), and
the comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended to the date hereof. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and accurate copies of the minutes (or, in the case of
minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of
the shareholders of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the Boards of
Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the committees of
each of such Boards of Directors, in each case held since April 1, 2006 and
prior to the date hereof. 

  

 (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists as of the date hereof each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and, as of the date hereof, each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (other than liens, charges and encumbrances for current taxes not yet due and payable) (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. Except for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity. 

  

 (c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on November 28, 2008, (i) 33,777,968 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including 223,385 Company Restricted Shares granted under the Company Stock Plans), (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury, (iii) 7,573,117 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan of the Company (the "2005 Plan"), the 2007 Strategic Equity Incentive Plan of the Company under the 2005 Plan, the 1991 Long-Term Incentive Plan of the Company and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of the Company (the "ESPP", and such plans, collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), of which 5,084,733 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding Company Stock Options and 302,160 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding Company PSU Awards, (iv) 5,206,625 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance upon exercise of the warrants (the "Company Warrants") granted or issued pursuant to the warrant agreements listed in Section 4.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, true and correct copies of which have been delivered to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Warrant Agreements"), (v) 5,206,625 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance upon conversion of the Companys outstanding 2.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "Company Convertible Notes") issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of December 22, 2003  ##### 

 

 

13   

between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the
"Company Convertible Notes Indenture") and (vi) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or were held by the Company as
treasury shares. Except as set forth above in this Section 4.01(c) and
for shares issued or to be issued upon the exercise of the Company Stock
Options outstanding on the date hereof and included in clause (iii) of the
first sentence of this Section 4.01(c), at the close of business on November
28, 2008, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
There are no outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer imposed by the Company,
stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights
to receive shares of Company Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights
(other than the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares, the
Company PSU Awards, the Company Convertible Notes and the Company Warrants)
that are linked to the value of Company Common Stock (collectively, but
exclusive of rights under the ESPP, "Company Stock-Based Awards"). Section
4.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list, as of November 28, 2008, of (A) all outstanding options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, together with any
options granted after November 28, 2008, as permitted by this Agreement, but
exclusive of rights under the ESPP, "Company Stock Options") under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject thereto, the grant dates, expiration dates, exercise or base
prices (if applicable) and vesting schedules thereof and the names of the
holders thereof, (B) all shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
but were subject to vesting or other forfeiture restrictions or were subject
to a right of repurchase by the Company at a fixed purchase price as of such
time (shares so subject, the "Company Restricted Shares") under the Company
Stock Plans or otherwise, the grant and issuance dates, vesting schedules and
repurchase price (if any) thereof and the names of the holders thereof,
(C) all outstanding performance stock unit awards in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company PSU Awards") under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject thereto, the grant dates and vesting schedules thereof and the
names of the holders thereof and (D) all outstanding Company Warrants, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, exercise price and vesting schedules thereof and the names
of the holders thereof. All (i) Company Restricted Shares, (ii) Company Stock
Options and (iii) Company PSU Awards are evidenced by stock option
agreements, restricted stock award agreements, performance stock unit award
agreements or other award agreements, in each case substantially in the forms
set forth in Section 4.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, except that
the forms of such agreements differ with respect to the number of options,
performance stock unit awards or shares covered thereby, the exercise price,
regular vesting schedule, repurchase price and expiration date applicable
thereto and other similar terms and, except for such differences, no stock
option agreement, restricted stock award agreement, performance stock unit
award agreement or other award agreement contains terms that are inconsistent
in any material respect with, or material terms in addition to, such forms.
Each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later than the
date on which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be
effective (the  ##### 

 

 

14   

"Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable,
approval by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof) and any required shareholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement
governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party
thereto, each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act
and all other applicable laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including
the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), the per share exercise
price of each Company Stock Option was equal to the fair market value (within
the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, in the case of each Company Stock
Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option", and within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code, in the case of each other Company Stock
Option) of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date
and each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the
financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company and
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act
and all other applicable laws. The Company has not knowingly granted, and
there is no and has been no Company policy or practice to knowingly grant,
Company Stock Options prior to, or otherwise knowingly coordinate the grant
of Company Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of
material information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
financial results or prospects. Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify
as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if any, so
qualifies. As of the close of business on November 28, 2008, there were
outstanding Company Stock Options to purchase 1,234,080 shares of Company
Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the Merger
Consideration, and the weighted average exercise price of such Company
Stock Options was equal to $19.897590. 1,249 shares of Company Common Stock
were subject to outstanding rights under the ESPP based on payroll
information for the period ending September 26, 2008 (assuming the fair
market value per share of Company Common Stock determined in accordance with
the terms of the ESPP on the last day of the offering period in effect under
the ESPP on the date hereof was equal to the Merger Consideration and that
payroll deductions continue at the current rate). Each Company Stock Option,
each Company Restricted Share and each Company PSU Award may, by its terms,
be treated at the Effective Time as set forth in Section 6.04(a)(i),
6.04(a)(ii) or 6.04(a)(iii), as applicable. Each of the Company Warrants has
an exercise price in excess of the Offer Price. The Company Warrants
terminate and expire in accordance with their terms on January 1, 2009, and
no payments in respect of the Company Warrants are payable by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in respect of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of such termination
or expiration. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are,
and all shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Options, the
Company PSU Awards, rights under the ESPP, the Company Convertible Notes and
the Company Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the terms
thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or, except for
the Company Convertible Notes, convertible into,  ##### 

 

 

15   

or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which shareholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above in this
Section 4.01(c), as of the date hereof, (x) there are not issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company, (B) any securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company or (C)
any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities, equity interests
or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital
stock or voting securities of the Company and (y) there are not any
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
securities. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such securities. Except as
set forth above in this Section 4.01(c), as of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding (1) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock
or voting securities or equity interests of any Subsidiary of the Company,
(2) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting securities, equity interests
or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital
stock or voting securities of any Subsidiary of the Company or
(3) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any such outstanding securities of any Subsidiary
of the Company or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered
or sold, any such securities of any Subsidiary of the Company. 

  

 (d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger if required by applicable law, to receipt of the Shareholder Approval. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger if required by applicable law, to receipt of the Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies. The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which all directors of the Company were present, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) declaring that it is in the best interests of the shareholders of the

conditions set forth in this Agreement, (iii) declaring that the terms of the
Offer and the Merger are fair to the Company and the shareholders of the
Company, (iv) directing that, if required by applicable law, the adoption of
this Agreement be submitted as promptly as practicable to a vote at a meeting
of the shareholders of the Company and (v) recommending that the shareholders
of the Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable law, approve and
adopt this Agreement, which resolutions, except to the extent permitted by
Section 5.02, have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in
any way. A committee of disinterested directors of the Board of Directors of
the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Offer and the Merger), which approval, to the extent applicable,
constituted approval under the provisions of Sections 302A.011, Subd. 38(h)
and 302A.673, Subd. 1 of the MBCA, as a result of which this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and
the Merger), are not and will not be subject to the restrictions on control
share acquisitions or business combinations under the provisions of Sections
302A.671 and 302A.673, respectively, of the MBCA, and (ii) recommended to the
Board of Directors of the Company that the Board of Directors of the
Company approve this agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or

Subsidiaries under, (x) the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or the

None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit Plan that would give rise to any material liability (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plan), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that could give rise to any material liability in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding. 

   

 (v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC Documents.

27 

   

other applicable law. During the last five years, no Company Benefit Plan or
related trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event"
(as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan, and no notice of a reportable event will be required to be filed in

 (xvii) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions. 

  

 (b) _Other Actions._ The Company, Parent and Sub shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or that would reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied. 

  

 (c) _Advice of Changes; Filings._ The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Sub) contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in a manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in clause (vi)(a) of Exhibit A or that would give rise to a right of termination set forth in Section 8.01(d)(A), as the case may be, or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 (ii) The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that the payment of the Merger Consideration and any payments made in respect of the Company Common Stock or the Dissenting Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are exempt from withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.  ##### 

 

 

51   

 (iii) The parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other with all information as is reasonably necessary for the parties to satisfy the reporting obligations under Section 6043A of the Code. 

  

 SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, or authorize any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly through another person (and it shall instruct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to instruct, each such Representative not to), (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and (B) promptly after the date hereof request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to such person(s) within the last 12 months for the purpose of evaluating a possible Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal by such party, and which Takeover Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02(a), the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) with respect to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which need not restrict such person from making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal) not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal. 

  

 The term "Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets (including for the purpose of this definition the outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange  ##### 

 

 

52   

offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or (iii)
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
any person or group or the shareholders of any person or group would own 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting
parent company of the Company or businesses or assets that constitute 15% or
more of the revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than, in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

  

 The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including the likelihood of consummation). 

  

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.02(a)) (an "Acquisition Agreement") or resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company may (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law and (y) following the earlier of (1) five business days after any then-  ##### 

 

 

53   

scheduled expiration date of the Offer on which all of the Offer Conditions
set forth in clauses (ii) through (vi) of Exhibit A are satisfied or, at
Subs sole discretion, waived and (2) the date that is 35 business days after
the date on which the Offer was commenced (such earlier date being referred
to as the "Superior Proposal Triggering Date"), in the case of each of
clauses (1) and (2) if the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied by
the Superior Proposal Triggering Date, cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal that was made after the date
hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02
and concurrently with or after such termination, cause the Company to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no Company Adverse Recommendation Change
may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
5.02(b)(y) may be made, in each case until after the fifth business
day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(b)(y) (a "Notice of
Termination"), as applicable, which notice shall specify the reasons for such
proposed action, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Board
of Directors is a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or new Notice of Termination,
as applicable, and a new five business day period). In determining whether to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 5.02(b)(y), (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall take into account any proposals for changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise (including whether
or not such proposals are binding on Parent) and (ii) the Company and
its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. 

  

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any financial terms and any other material term thereof) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including any change to the financial terms or any other material term thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all drafts and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their respective Representatives), on the one hand, and the person making such Takeover Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand.  ##### 

 

 

54  

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (y) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law, including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the shareholders of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b) (it being understood that any accurate disclosure of factual information required to be made under applicable law or other applicable Legal Provisions shall not be considered a modification prohibited by Section 5.02).

 _Additional Agreements_   

  

 SECTION 6.01. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting._ (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company is required by applicable law, as promptly as practicable following the Offer Closing, the Company and Parent shall prepare and the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent or Sub as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the preparation, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and the staff of the SEC, on the other hand with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided its comments to the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after such document or response is transmitted to Parent for its review. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other  ##### 

 

 

55   

parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. 

  

 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is required by applicable law, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Offer Closing (or, with respect to calling, giving notice of, convening and holding a meeting of its shareholders, as soon as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act or the resolution of any comments from the SEC), establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Shareholders Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders adoption of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without the Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 302A.621 of the MBCA. 

  

 (c) At the Shareholders Meeting, if any, Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the Shareholder Approval. Parent also agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Offer, and any other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent, to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if required by applicable law. 

  

 SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for the purpose of coordinating integration and transition planning activities with the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, personnel and records but only to the extent that such access is not prohibited by applicable Legal Provisions and does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, other than any such report, schedule, registration statement or other document that is available in unredacted form on EDGAR, (b) a copy of each correspondence or written communication, other than immaterial correspondence and written communication, with any United States Federal or state Governmental Entity  ##### 

 

 

56   

and (c) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such copies or other
information to the extent that doing so would result in a violation
of applicable Legal Provisions or the loss of attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a violation
of applicable Legal Provisions or loss of attorney-client privilege). Except
for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives
to hold, all information received from the Company, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and
shall otherwise comply with the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
such information. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 or
information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 6.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions set forth in Exhibit A and Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including any acts, actions, nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals and steps in respect of Chapter 80B of the Minnesota Statutes), and (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; _provided_ that none of the Company, Parent or Sub shall be required to make any payment to any such third parties or concede anything of value to obtain such consents. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall duly file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing") required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any similar filings in other jurisdictions that counsel for Parent reasonably deems necessary, in each case as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. The HSR Filing shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of its HSR Filing and any similar filings in other jurisdictions, to request early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act and the laws of any other jurisdiction where an antitrust notification is made, and, if requested, to promptly amend or furnish  ##### 

 

 

57   

additional information thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company agrees that,
during the term of this Agreement, it will not withdraw its filing under the
HSR Act or any other similar filings in other jurisdictions without the
written consent of the other party. The parties agree to cooperate and to use
their respective reasonable commercial efforts to respond to any requests for
information from a Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable. Each party
shall (i) give the other parties hereto prompt notice upon obtaining
knowledge of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties
hereto informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the other parties hereto of
any communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the
U.S. Department of Justice, any foreign competition authority or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) subject to the terms of
Section 6.02, use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each
other all information required for any filing, form, declaration,
notification, registration and notice, other than confidential or proprietary
information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
request or additional request for additional information or documentary
material pursuant to Section 7A(e) of the HSR Act or in connection with any
other legal investigation, action or proceeding. Each party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with a Request for
Additional Information pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Section 18a(e)(1). The Company
and its Board of Directors shall (1) use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require Parent to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets
or any portion of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. 

  

 SECTION 6.04. _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares; Company PSU Awards; ESPP._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following: 

   

 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that the Company Stock  ##### 

 

 

58   

Options will become fully exercisable and may be exercised before the
Effective Time at such applicable time or times as specified in the Company
Stock Plans, and, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and the
holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, a single lump sum cash payment equal to
the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Stock Option; 

   

 (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares as necessary to provide that each Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(c); 

   

 (iii) adjust the terms of each outstanding Company PSU Award as necessary to provide that (A) the applicable performance period shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the greater of (1) 100% of the stock units subject to such PSU Award and (2) the applicable percentage of stock units subject to such PSU Award determined in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable award agreement based on the Companys "Actual TSR Performance" (as defined in the applicable award agreement) for the shortened performance period, shall vest in full; (B) each such stock unit that so vests shall be converted into the right to receive the sum of (y) the Merger Consideration and (z) a cash amount equal to the aggregate per-share amount of any ordinary cash dividends paid by the Company on the Company Common Stock during the shortened performance period; and (C) any stock units subject to such PSU Award that do not vest pursuant to this Section 6.04(a)(iii) shall terminate as of the Effective Time; and 

   

 (iv) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administering the ESPP), shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the ESPP (i) participation following the date of this Agreement shall be limited to those employees who participate on the date of this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iv) each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs (if not earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the  ##### 

 

 

59   

ESPP); _provided_ that all amounts allocated to each participants account
under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the
Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price
determined under the terms of the ESPP for the then outstanding offering
periods using such date as the final purchase date for each such
offering period, and (v) the ESPP shall terminate immediately following such
purchases of Company Common Stock. 

  

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 6.04(a) and 6.04(b) shall be subject to any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company PSU Award or Company Stock-Based Award (or former holder of a Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company PSU Award, Company Warrant or Company Stock-Based Award) or any current or former participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or any other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights). 

  

 SECTION 6.05. _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and Insurance._  (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof or as amended or entered into prior to the Closing with the consent of Parent), without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a material portion of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05 or Parent shall take such other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving Corporation, legal and financial, to satisfy such obligations will not be diminished. 

  

 (c) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore made available to  ##### 

 

 

60   

Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable
than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.05(c),
Parent shall not be obligated to pay more than $1,400,000 in the aggregate to
obtain such coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event such
coverage cannot be obtained for $1,400,000 or less in the aggregate, Parent
shall be obligated to obtain, effective from the Effective Time and for six
years thereafter, a prepaid policy providing the maximum coverage as may be
obtained for such $1,400,000 aggregate amount. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 6.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 6.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or (B) the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or (ii) (A) prior to the Offer Closing, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $31,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first business day following (x) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required by clause (ii) above, the date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii)(C). For purposes of clause (ii)(C) of the immediately preceding sentence only, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(a) except that all references to "15%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "35%". 

  

 (c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Section 6.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the  ##### 

 

 

61   

Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. 

  

 SECTION 6.07. _Public Announcements._ Except (a) with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (b) with respect to disclosures that are consistent with prior disclosures made in compliance with this Section 6.07, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that all formal Company employee communication programs or announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the forms mutually agreed to by the parties (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

  

 SECTION 6.08. _Shareholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

(a) For a period of not less than six months following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries employed primarily in the United States who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") shall receive employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; _provided_ _further_ , that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i) for purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parents defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under Parents vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility and participation under any health or welfare plan maintained by  ##### 

 

 

62   

Parent (other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare
plan) and (iv) unless covered under another arrangement with or of the
Company, for benefit accrual purposes under Parents severance plan (in the
case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent that
Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the
Surviving Corporation and not in any case where credit would result in
duplication of benefits), but not for purposes of any other employee benefit
plan of Parent. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and nothing therein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy, arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose. Without limiting the scope of Section 9.07, nothing in this Section 6.09 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee or any other person other than Parent, the Company and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan. 

  

 (e) With respect to the employees of the Company who are employed primarily outside the United States, following the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries will provide such employees with employee benefits in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 SECTION 6.10. _Actions with Respect to the Company Convertible Notes._ (a) The Company shall, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Company Convertible Notes Indenture, take all actions necessary to redeem all outstanding Company Convertible Notes with a Redemption Date (as defined in the Company Convertible Notes Indenture) of January 1, 2009, at a price not to exceed the Redemption Price (as defined in the Company Convertible Notes Indenture) plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and in connection with such redemption take all other actions as may be necessary to satisfy and discharge the Company Convertible Notes Indenture.  ##### 

 

 

63  

 (b) The Company has delivered to Parent a true and accurate copy of that certain letter agreement (the "Company Hedge Agreement") dated as of December 17, 2003, between the Company and Credit Suisse (f/k/a Credit Suisse First Boston International) in respect of the convertible note hedge transaction (the "Company Hedge") between the Company and Credit Suisse, and has not and will not take any action to waive or amend any rights available to it under the Company Hedge Agreement. Following the date hereof, the Company (i) shall not make any payments in respect of the Company Hedge other than as expressly set forth in the Company Hedge Agreement as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) shall not notify Credit Suisse that it intends to settle the Company Hedge through Net Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement and (iii) shall, with respect to each Conversion Event occurring after the date hereof, settle the Company Hedge through Physical Settlement.

 SECTION 6.11. _Actions with Respect to Lines of Credit._ From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Sub and use its commercially reasonable efforts in order to facilitate the repayment of all amounts that may be owing under the Credit Agreement dated as of May 25, 2005, among the Company, Bank of the West, Union Bank of California, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank National Association (the "Credit Agreement") and the Credit Agreement dated as of October 4, 2005, between the Company and Cooperative RaboBank Leiden, Leiderdorp en Oestgstgeest U.A. (collectively, the "Existing Credit Facilities") at the Closing Date (or, if requested by Parent, at the Offer Closing), and to permanently terminate the commitments thereunder and discharge and release all guarantees, Liens or other obligations in respect of the Existing Credit Facilities, in each case effective as of the Closing Date (or, if requested by Parent, as of the Offer Closing), including by obtaining all necessary waivers of any advance notice requirements with respect thereto and facilitating the execution by the lenders and agents under the Existing Credit Facilities of customary pay-off letters, lien releases and similar documentation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries agree to the payment of any fees, penalties, premium or other amounts in respect of the matters contemplated by this Section 6.11 without the prior consent of Parent (other than as may be required by the terms of the Existing Credit Facilities as in effect on the date hereof). 

  

 SECTION 6.12. _Directors_. (a) Effective upon the Offer Closing, Parent shall be entitled, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, to designate, from time to time, such number of members of the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent representation equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (a) the total number of directors (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer and any Top-Up Shares) bears to (ii) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock then outstanding; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the  ##### 

 

 

64   

members of the Board of Directors of the Company (as long as Parent and its
Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the shares of the Company Common
Stock). At such times, subject to applicable law, the Company will cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute such number of members of each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, rounded up to the next
whole number, that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board of Directors of the Company, other than
any committee established to take action under this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.12(b). The Company shall take all action reasonably requested by
Parent necessary to effect any such election or appointment, including
(A) increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company and (B)
obtaining the resignation of such number of its current directors as is, in
each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so elected or appointed
to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance with applicable
law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective Time, Rule
10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the applicable rules of the NYSE). The
Company shall mail to its shareholders the Information Statement containing
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder, and the Company agrees to make such mailing concurrently
with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 ( _provided_ that Parent and Sub shall
have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be
included in the Information Statement with respect to such designees and with
respect to Parents officers, directors and affiliates). 

  

 (b) Following the election or appointment of Parents or Subs designees pursuant to Section 6.12(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office shall be required for the Company to consent (a) to amend or terminate this Agreement, (b) to waive any of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement or (c) to extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Sub. Such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company and no other action on the part of the Company, including any actions by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize such action. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Independent Director" shall mean a member of the Companys Board of Directors who is a member of the Companys Board of Directors on the date of this Agreement and who is not an officer of Parent. 

  

 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 6.12, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to maintain at least three Independent Directors; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if the number of Independent Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate a person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, employees, shareholders or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.13. _Rule 14d-10 Matters._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof and prior to the  ##### 

 

 

65   

Offer Closing, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable,
or pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
person who would have assumed such role or performed such duties but for a
requirement to refrain from assuming such role or performing such duties in
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement) unless, prior to such entry
into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee
(each member of which shall be an "independent director" in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time
of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to
(i) approve as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

The failure by Parent or Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
