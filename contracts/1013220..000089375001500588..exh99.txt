THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of November
20, 2001, by and among WellPoint Health Networks Inc., a Delaware for-profit
corporation ("Purchaser"), CareFirst, Inc., a Maryland not-for-profit
corporation ("CareFirst"), and Congress Acquisition Corp., a Maryland
corporation ("CFAC").   RECITALS   1. Purchaser directly owns all of the
issued and outstanding stock of CFAC;   2. The Board of Directors of each
of Purchaser, CareFirst and CFAC (a) have approved the merger of CFAC with
and into CareFirst upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, including the ancillary agreements executed and delivered pursuant
hereto and (b) deem such merger to be in the best interests of their
respective companies and subscribers, and, in the case of Purchaser and CFAC,
their respective stockholders;   3. Because Purchaser is a for-profit
company and CareFirst and the Primary CareFirst Insurers are each not-for-
profit companies, it will be necessary for the Primary CareFirst Companies to
convert to for-profit status immediately prior to the consummation of such
merger, and as part of the conversion of the Primary CareFirst Companies,
CareFirst will issue 100% of its outstanding shares of capital stock
("CareFirst Common Stock") to certain tax-exempt entities (each, a "Tax-
Exempt Entity") to be designated in accordance with applicable laws, so that,
immediately prior to the merger, the Tax-Exempt Entities will constitute all
of the stockholders of CareFirst. The principal elements of such conversion
are as set forth in Appendix A hereto;   4. The parties expect and intend
that the merger of CFAC with and into CareFirst will: (i) create an
enterprise that takes advantage of the strengths, contributions, resources
and prospects of each of the parties; (ii) enhance the offering of
competitive Blue Cross Blue Shield and other related health care products for
Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland and other jurisdictions in which
CareFirst operates; (iii) provide the workforce of the CareFirst Companies
opportunities for employment within each such Company\'s current service area
consistent with the collective enterprise\'s evolving business requirements;
(iv) create a collective enterprise which provides additional financial
strength for the customers of each of the parties, allows each of the parties
access to capital to support strategic initiatives and positions the
collective enterprise as a more significant regional competitor; and (v)
cause, allow and assist the Primary CareFirst Insurers to continue to
maintain a significant presence within their respective jurisdictions,
including operations in each jurisdiction consistent with the collective
enterprise\'s evolving business requirements, the maintenance of the
corporate headquarters of each within their respective jurisdictions and the
provision of products and services to residents in their respective
jurisdictions; and     -1-    5. Purchaser and CareFirst desire to
enter into this Agreement and to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger.   NOW THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:    ARTICLE I   Definitions   Terms used in this Agreement not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Appendix
B.    ARTICLE II   The Merger   Section 2.1. The Merger.   Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, CFAC
shall be merged with and into CareFirst, and the separate corporate existence
of CFAC shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). CareFirst shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation").   Section 2.2. Effective Time.   If all the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII shall have been fulfilled
or waived in accordance herewith and this Agreement shall not have been
terminated as provided in Article VIII, the consummation of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Piper Marbury Rudnick and Wolfe
LLP, 6225 Smith Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21209 as promptly as possible,
but in no event later than five (5) business days, after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII that are to
occur prior to, but not on, the date of the Closing. The day the Closing
occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." The parties shall cause
the Articles of Merger substantially in the form of Appendix C (the "Articles
of Merger") to be properly executed and filed with the Maryland State
Department of Assessments and Taxation and any other required jurisdictions
on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing
the Articles of Merger or at such later time which the parties hereto shall
have agreed upon and designated in such filing as the effective time of the
Merger (the "Effective Time").    -2-   Section 2.3. Charter.   The
Charter of CareFirst (substantially in the form of Appendix D) in effect upon
its conversion to a stock corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Charter of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in
accordance with applicable law.   Section 2.4. Bylaws.   The Bylaws of
CareFirst (substantially in the form of Appendix E) in effect upon its
conversion to a stock corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in
accordance with applicable law.   Section 2.5. Directors, Officers and Name
of CareFirst.   From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (i)
the directors of CFAC immediately prior to the Merger shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of CareFirst
immediately prior to the Merger shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation. The name of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time shall continue to be "CareFirst, Inc."   Section 2.6.
Headquarters.   From and after the Effective Time, the headquarters of
BCBSD, BCBS-NCA and BCBS-MD shall be located in the State of Delaware, the
District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, respectively.    ARTICLE
III   Conversion of Shares; Purchase Price; Effects of the
Merger   Section 3.1. Conversion of Shares; Purchase Price.   (a) At the
Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of CareFirst Common Stock
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the Per Share Amount. The "Per Share
Amount" shall consist of the Per Share Cash Consideration plus the Per Share
Stock Consideration plus the Per Share Note Consideration, if any. The "Per
Share Cash Consideration" shall be an amount of cash determined by dividing
(i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration by (ii) the number of shares
of CareFirst Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The "Per Share Stock Consideration" shall be that number of shares
of Purchaser Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the Aggregate
Stock Consideration by (ii) the number of shares of CareFirst Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The "Per Share
Note Consideration" shall be an amount payable in the form of Subordinated
Notes with a principal     -3-   amount determined by dividing (i) the
Aggregate Note Consideration by (ii) the number of shares of CareFirst Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Per Share Note
Consideration shall only be payable upon the occurrence of the condition set
forth in Section 3.1(b).   (b) If the Average Market Price is below $70.00,
then, in addition to the other consideration to be paid hereunder, Purchaser
may, at its option, issue a Subordinated Note (substantially in the form of
Appendix F) to each holder of CareFirst Common Stock in a principal amount
equal to the Per Share Note Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
of CareFirst Common Stock held by such holder. The parties intend that the
Subordinated Notes will bear an interest rate that would be applicable if the
Subordinated Notes were sold to an institutional holder in a transaction
where the Notes were intended to have a value as of the Closing Date equal to
the principal amount of the notes (provided, however, in determining the
interest rate and value, the Subordinated Notes, which by their terms may be
prepaid at any time without penalty or discount, will be assumed to have a
"market" prepayment clause for a note of this type). If Purchaser anticipates
that it may elect to deliver Subordinated Notes in payment of part of the
consideration to be delivered to the holders of CareFirst Common Stock, it
will notify CareFirst that it may wish to do so at least thirty (30) days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or if it determines anytime thereafter
that Subordinated Notes may be used, promptly upon such determination), and
CareFirst and Purchaser shall jointly select a nationally recognized
investment banking firm (the "Investment Banking Firm") who then shall be
available, if necessary, to arbitrate any final determination of the interest
rate to be assigned to the Subordinated Notes. If Purchaser then elects to
deliver Subordinated Notes, at the time that it provides the five (5)
Business days\' notice prior to the Closing Date of its election to deliver
the Subordinated Notes it also will set forth the interest rate that it
proposes to assign to the Subordinated Notes, and CareFirst shall advise
Purchaser within two (2) Business days thereafter whether or not the proposed
interest rate is acceptable. If CareFirst advises Purchaser that the interest
rate is not acceptable, and the parties are not able to reach agreement on an
interest rate satisfying the requirements of this Section 3.1(b),
determination of the interest rate will be based upon the written advice of
the Investment Banking Firm. The costs and expenses of the Investment Banking
Firm shall be split evenly between Purchaser and CareFirst.   (c) At the
Closing, each holder of outstanding CareFirst Common Stock as shown on the
books and records of CareFirst shall receive, in respect of each share of
CareFirst Common Stock, a certificate or certificates representing the number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock along with cash (or immediately available
funds) and Subordinated Notes that together constitute the Per Share
Amount.   Section 3.2. Effects of the Merger.   The Merger shall have the
effects specified in Section 3-114 of the Maryland General Corporation
Law.     -4-    ARTICLE IV   Representations And Warranties Of
CareFirst   CareFirst hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland; each
CareFirst Subsidiary is listed on the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule.

is the sole member and is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its state of formation. Each CareFirst Company
(other than CareFirst and the Primary CareFirst Insurers) has been duly
formed and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation, which jurisdictions are listed on the CareFirst
Disclosure Schedule.   (b) Each CareFirst Company has all requisite power
and authority, corporate and other, to carry on and conduct its business as
it is now being conducted and to own or lease its properties and assets,
except where the failure to satisfy the representations of this Section
4.1(b) would not result in a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect. CareFirst has
delivered or made available to Purchaser accurate and complete copies of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent governing instruments, as
currently in effect, of each of the CareFirst Companies as of the date
hereof.   (c) Each CareFirst Company is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or operation of
its assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
result in a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect. All such jurisdictions are
listed on the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule.   (d) Except as contemplated
herein, no equity security of any CareFirst Company is or may be required to
be issued by reason of any option, warrant, right to subscribe to, call or
commitment of any character whatsoever relating to, or security or right
exchangeable or convertible into, shares of any capital stock of such
CareFirst Company, and there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which any CareFirst Company is bound to issue or repurchase
shares of its capital stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
acquire any additional shares of its capital stock. All shares of the

Disclosure Schedule sets forth the equity or member interests of each
CareFirst Subsidiary that are owned by CareFirst or another CareFirst
Company. The CareFirst Subsidiary Shares are owned, possessed or controlled

refusal, encumbrances or other restrictions of any kind, with no defects of
title whatsoever. CareFirst or another CareFirst Company has full power,
right and authority to vote all of the CareFirst Subsidiary Shares. CareFirst
is not a party to or bound by any voting trust, proxy or other agreement
affecting or relating to the right to transfer or vote the CareFirst
Subsidiary Shares.   Section 4.2. Authority.   CareFirst has all
requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the
receipt of the regulatory approvals set forth in Section 4.4(b). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by CareFirst, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Boards of
Directors of CareFirst and BCBSD, and except for the approval of the Merger
by the Tax-Exempt Entities in their capacity as stockholders of CareFirst
following the Conversion, no other corporate act or corporate proceeding on
the part of the CareFirst Companies is necessary to approve the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance by CareFirst of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 4.3. Execution and Binding Effect.   This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by CareFirst and
constitutes, and the other documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered by CareFirst pursuant hereto upon their execution and delivery by
CareFirst on or prior to the Closing Date will constitute (assuming, in each
case, the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the
other party or parties thereto), legal, valid and binding obligations of
CareFirst, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
rehabilitation, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and (b) general equitable
principles.   Section 4.4. No Violation; Consents and Approvals.   (a)
Except as set forth on the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule and subject to the
governmental filings (and other matters) referred to in Section 4.4(b), the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by CareFirst,
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the consummation by
CareFirst or any CareFirst Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not (i) conflict with or violate any provisions of the Charters or
Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof of any CareFirst Company (and with
respect to CareFirst and the Primary CareFirst Insurers, as such Charters and
Bylaws are to be amended to accomplish the Conversion); (ii) conflict with,
violate or result in any breach of, or constitute a default whether with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of, or render   -6-   unenforceable, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, license (including any license granted by BCBSA),
franchise, permit, agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to
which any CareFirst Company is a party or by which any CareFirst Company, its
business or any of its assets is bound; (iii) violate any statute, ordinance
or law or any rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity applicable to any CareFirst Company, or by which its
business or any of its assets is bound; (iv) require any filing, declaration
or registration with, or permit, consent or approval of, or the giving of any
notice to, any Governmental Entity; or (v) result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any CareFirst Company\'s
assets; excluding from the foregoing clauses (other than clause (i)) such
conflicts, violations, breaches and defaults and filings, declarations,
registrations, permits, consents, approvals and notices, other than approvals
of the BCBSA, the absence of which, in the aggregate, would not result in a
CareFirst Material Adverse Effect.   (b) No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required by any CareFirst Company for the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by CareFirst or the consummation by CareFirst
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing
with the FTC and the DOJ of a notification and report form by CareFirst under
the HSR Act and (ii) the preparation and filing of appropriate documents
with, and approval of, the appropriate regulatory bodies in the States of
Maryland and Delaware, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Congress and other
jurisdictions regarding insurance-related approvals (collectively referred to
as the "CareFirst Primary Filings").  Section 4.5. Financial
Statements.   (a) CareFirst has delivered or made available to Purchaser
copies of the financial statements listed on the CareFirst Disclosure
Schedule (the "CareFirst Financial Statements"). The CareFirst Financial
Statements are true and complete in all material respects, have been prepared
in accordance with SAP or GAAP, as the case may be, consistently applied
throughout the periods covered by such statements (except as may be stated in
the explanatory notes to such statements) and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and results of operations (consolidated in
the case of CareFirst) of the CareFirst Companies at the dates of and for the
periods covered thereby. The CareFirst Financial Statements for interim
periods are subject to normal recurring year-end adjustments and lack
explanatory notes.   (b) Except as disclosed, recorded or otherwise referred
to in the CareFirst Financial Statements at and for the year ended December
31, 2000, no CareFirst Company has any liabilities of any nature, whether
known, unknown, accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due
or to become due, probable of assertion or not, except liabilities that (i)
were incurred after December 31, 2000 in the ordinary course of its business
consistent with past practices, and (ii) in the aggregate would not have a
CareFirst Material Adverse Effect.    -7-   Section 4.6. Reserves.  
(a) Except as set forth in the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule, the aggregate
actuarial reserves and other actuarial amounts held in respect of liabilities
with respect to any or all of the CareFirst Insurers as established or
reflected in their respective 2000 financial statements previously delivered
to Purchaser:   (i) (A) were determined in accordance with
presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied, and (B) were
fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with sound actuarial
principles;   (ii) met the requirements of the applicable insurance laws or
regulations of the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, the State of
Delaware or any other state having jurisdiction, in all
material respects;   (iii) met the requirements of the BCBSA;   (iv) have
been computed in all material respects on the basis of methodologies
consistent with those used in computing the corresponding reserves in the
prior fiscal year (except as may be stated in the explanatory notes to such
statements);   (v) include provisions for all actuarial reserves
and related items that are required to be established in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations; and   (vi) CareFirst is unaware of
any facts or circumstances that would necessitate, in the application of
prudent reserving practices and policies, any material adverse change in the
statutorily required reserve or reserves above those reflected in the most
recent CareFirst Financial Statements (other than those increases consistent
with past experience resulting from increases in enrollment).   (b) Each
Primary CareFirst Insurer\'s surplus is now, and immediately prior to the
Closing will be, not less than 100% of the statutorily adequate reserve
minimums required by applicable law.   Section 4.7. Taxes.   (a) As of
the date hereof, each of the Primary CareFirst Companies has been and, to
CareFirst\'s knowledge, is an "existing Blue Cross and Blue Shield
organization" as defined in Section 833(c)(2) of the Code, and has filed its
federal income tax returns for all periods after the effective date of
Section 833 of the Code consistent with its reasonable interpretation of the
treatment described in Section 833 of the Code.   (b) All federal income tax
returns required to be filed by any CareFirst Company have been properly and
timely filed with the IRS, and all state and local income and premium tax
returns required to be filed by any CareFirst Company have been properly and
timely filed with the appropriate state or local taxing authorities, or an
appropriate application for extension of    -8-   time to file such
returns has been filed. Except as set forth in the CareFirst Disclosure
Schedule, such tax returns were true, correct and complete in all material
respects at the time filed, and each CareFirst Company has paid
and discharged all Taxes shown to be due on such returns, other than such
Taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
are adequately reserved for on the most recent financial statements.
Each CareFirst Company has adequately reserved, in accordance with SAP or
GAAP, as applicable, on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.5,
for the payment of all unpaid Taxes, including interest and penalties,
payable in respect of any taxable event or period (including interim periods)
ending on the dates of such financial statements and for all periods prior
thereto.   (c) No claim or deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed,
asserted, assessed or, to the knowledge of CareFirst, threatened by the IRS
or any other taxing authority or agency against any CareFirst Company. No
requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes are pending. Except as
set forth in the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule, none of the federal income
tax returns for any CareFirst Company has been examined by or settled with
the IRS for any year, and none of the tax returns for any CareFirst Company
remains open or pending.   (d) None of the CareFirst Companies is a party
to, is bound by or has any obligation under any tax sharing agreement or
similar contract arrangement or any agreement that obligates it to make any
payment computed by reference to the Taxes, Taxable income or Taxable losses
of any other person.   Section 4.8. Absence of Certain Changes or
Events.   Except as set forth on CareFirst\'s Disclosure Schedule,
since December 31, 2000 and through the date of this Agreement, (a) each of
the CareFirst Companies has, in all material respects, conducted its business
in the ordinary course consistent with past practices, (b) since, September
30, 2001, neither CareFirst nor any CareFirst Subsidiary has taken any action
set forth in Section 6.1(a) which if taken after the date hereof would
violate such Section and (c) the CareFirst Companies have not experienced an
event that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a CareFirst
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.9. Litigation; Judicial
Proceedings.   (a) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no judicial
or administrative actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to
the knowledge of CareFirst, threatened, that (i) question the validity of
this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by CareFirst in connection
with this Agreement, or (ii) seek to prevent the consummation by CareFirst of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Except as set
forth in the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise disclosed in
writing by CareFirst to Purchaser on or before the date of this Agreement,
there is no litigation, proceeding, suit, action, charge or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of CareFirst, threatened, or any order,
judgment, injunction, decree, plea agreement, stipulation or award of any
kind outstanding, against or relating to any CareFirst Company, or involving
any of     -9-   its property or business, the outcome of which in the
aggregate may reasonably be expected to result in a CareFirst Material
Adverse Effect.  Section 4.10. Compliance with Law.   (a) Each CareFirst
Company is conducting its business in compliance with all statutes, laws,
rules, regulations, ordinances, decrees, judgments, injunctions and orders
applicable to it (including those relating to ERISA, labor laws, Health
Benefit Laws, environmental laws and health and safety matters), except where
such failure to comply would not have a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect,
and has not received any notice that it is in material noncompliance with any
such statutes, laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, decrees or orders.  
(b) Each CareFirst Company currently holds all permits, licenses
and approvals of every Governmental Entity necessary for the ownership of
its respective assets and the operation of its respective businesses

pending or, to the knowledge of CareFirst,  threatened against the CareFirst
Plans or their assets, or arising  out of the CareFirst Plans, and, to the
knowledge of CareFirst, no  facts exist which may reasonably be expected to
give rise to any  such actions.   (iii) Each of the CareFirst Plans can be
terminated by a  CareFirst Company within a period of thirty (30) days
following the  Closing, without payment of any additional compensation or
amount  or, with the exception of the termination of any CareFirst Plans to 
which Section 401(a) of the Code applies, the additional vesting or 
acceleration of any such benefits.   (i) Except as required by applicable
law or as would not have a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect, since December
31, 2000, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material
respect by any CareFirst Company of any of the CareFirst Plans providing
benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of any
CareFirst Company. Except as disclosed in the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule,
since December 31, 2000, no CareFirst Company     -12-   has taken any
action to accelerate any rights or benefits under any CareFirst Plan, either

benefits  solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 4.13. Capital Stock.   (a) The

of conversion or other instrument, and CareFirst is not and, following the

all material respects.   (b) No CareFirst Company has stored or used any
Materials of Environmental Concern at any CareFirst Property, except in such

Property or with respect to any other property except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect.   (d) No CareFirst
Company is the subject of any actual or, to CareFirst\'s knowledge,
threatened federal, state, local or private litigation involving a claim of
liability or a demand for damages arising out of any alleged violation of any

Effect.   (f) Except as set forth in the CareFirst Environmental Reports,

matters set forth in the CareFirst Environmental Reports, neither any
CareFirst Company nor any CareFirst Property is currently in violation of any

result in a CareFirst Material Adverse Effect.   (h) Each CareFirst Company
has timely filed all reports required by any Environmental Law and has
generated and maintained all data, documentation and records required under

Liens. Except as set forth on the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule, there is not
under any such CareFirst Real Property Lease any existing default, or any
condition, event, or act which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute such a default, which in either case, in the aggregate with all
such other CareFirst\'s Real Property Leases under which there is such a
default, condition, event or act, would have a CareFirst Material Adverse
Effect.    -16-   Section 4.21. Affiliate Transactions.   Except as
disclosed on the CareFirst Disclosure Schedule, neither CareFirst nor any

parties hereto, dated December 8, 2000, CareFirst shall (and shall cause its
subsidiaries to) provide Purchaser reasonable access during regular business

pursuant to this Section and (b) no investigation made pursuant to this
Section shall unreasonably interfere with the operation or conduct of
business of CareFirst.   Section 6.3. Transfer Taxes.   All sales or
transfer taxes, including stock transfer taxes, document recording fees, real
property transfer taxes, and excise taxes, arising out of or in connection
with the consummation of the Merger shall be paid by Purchaser. All such

paid by CareFirst.      -26-   Section 6.4. Preparation of Supporting
Documents.   In addition to such actions as the parties may otherwise be
required to take under this Agreement or applicable law in order to
consummate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the
parties shall take such action, shall furnish such information, and shall
prepare, or cooperate in preparing, and execute and deliver such
certificates, agreements and other instruments as the other party may
reasonably request from time to time before, at or after the Closing, with
respect to compliance with the obligations of CareFirst, CFAC, or Purchaser
in connection with the Merger and the Conversion. Any information so
furnished by the parties shall be true, correct and complete in all material
respects and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.   Section 6.5. Purchaser\'s
Stockholders\' Meetings.   If a meeting of Purchaser\'s stockholders is
required to comply with Purchaser\'s obligations under the rules of the NYSE,
after the filing of the Plan of Conversion with the appropriate state
regulatory bodies and prior to any final hearing thereon, Purchaser will take
all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (including filing with the SEC and mailing to its
stockholders the Purchaser Proxy Statement) for the purpose of approving the
stock issuance contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger and for such
other purposes as may be necessary or desirable in connection with
effectuating the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Subject to
applicable law and compliance by Purchaser and CFAC with the material terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Purchaser shall,
if such vote is so required, recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of
and shall use its Best Efforts to obtain any necessary approval by the
stockholders of Purchaser of the foregoing.   Section 6.6. SEC and
Stockholder Filings.   Purchaser shall send to CareFirst copies of all

stockholders or the SEC.   Section 6.7. Consents, Waivers, Authorizations,
etc.   (a) Each of CareFirst and Purchaser will use its Best Efforts
to obtain all consents, waivers, authorizations, orders and approvals of and
make all filings and registrations with, any governmental commission, board
or other regulatory body or any third party, required for, or in connection
with, the performance by them of this Agreement and the consummation by them
of the transactions contemplated hereby, or as may be required in order not
to accelerate, violate, breach or terminate any agreement to which either
party or any of their respective Subsidiaries may be subject. Each party
will cooperate fully with each other party in assisting it to obtain such
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties will not take any
action which     -27-   could reasonably be anticipated to have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
approvals, regulatory or otherwise.   (b) Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties agree that Purchaser shall make such filings as
are required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby on its behalf, including the "Form A" regulatory filings
to be made with the appropriate state regulatory bodies and shall coordinate
the conduct of the hearing or hearings before the appropriate regulator in
each such jurisdiction in connection with such filings. The hearings referred
to in the preceding sentence are referred to individually as "Hearing" and
collectively as the "Hearings." CareFirst and Purchaser will reasonably
cooperate with regard to the content of the filings referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 6.7(b). CareFirst and Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall submit all such filings and hearing testimony, witness lists and other
similar materials relating to the hearing to the other for its review prior
to filing. Purchaser agrees to appeal any adverse findings in connection with
any orders issued as a result of the Hearings and to use its Best Efforts in
pursuing such appeal (assuming that Purchaser, and not CareFirst, is the
appropriate party to file such appeal). CareFirst and Purchaser will
reasonably cooperate with regard to such appeal.   Section 6.8. Conversion
of Primary CareFirst Companies.   As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, the Primary CareFirst Companies shall take all appropriate
and necessary steps so that, immediately prior to the Merger, the Primary
CareFirst Companies shall convert from non-stock membership corporations to
stock corporations and from not-for-profit status to for-profit status
(collectively, the "Conversion"). In connection with the Conversion,
CareFirst shall apply for the Private Letter Ruling. Prior to the submission
of such ruling request, CareFirst will consult with Purchaser regarding the
pertinent factual representations to be made in connection with such ruling
request and subsequent supplemental submissions and shall provide Purchaser
with a draft of the ruling request for Purchaser\'s review and comment, and
all reasonable comments shall be incorporated into such ruling
request.   Section 6.9. Liability; Indemnification.   From and until six
years after the Effective Time:   (a) CareFirst shall, and Purchaser shall
cause CareFirst and the CareFirst Subsidiaries to, keep in full force and
effect and honor any provisions in their respective charters and bylaws
providing for immunity from monetary liability for, exculpation of liability
for, and indemnification of, present or former trustees, directors, officers,
fiduciaries, employees or agents as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
except as required by applicable law, or except for changes permitted by law
that would enlarge the rights under such provisions, or would not adversely
affect the rights thereunder, of individuals who, on or prior to the Closing
Date, were trustees, directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees or agents of
CareFirst or the CareFirst Subsidiaries, as     -28-   the case may be
(and provided further that any permissive advance of expense provision shall
be administered as a mandatory advance of expense provision).   (b) In
addition to the provisions of subparagraph (a), CareFirst shall, and
Purchaser shall cause CareFirst and the CareFirst Subsidiaries to, maintain
in effect, liability insurance against claims asserted based on acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing covering those categories
of persons who are currently covered by CareFirst\'s or the
CareFirst Subsidiaries\' (as the case may be) liability insurance policy or
policies, on terms substantially as favorable as the terms of such insurance
coverage in effect as of the date hereof, so long as, the premium for such
six year tail coverage is not in excess of 1,200% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date hereof. If the premium for such insurance would at any
time exceed such amount, then Purchaser shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available for a premium not in
excess of such amount.   (c) In the event Purchaser, CareFirst or any
CareFirst Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of their respective properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the successors and assigns of Purchaser, CareFirst and any CareFirst
Company, as the case may be, will assume the obligations set forth in
Sections 6.9(a) and (b) if they are not otherwise assumed by operation of
law.   (d) This Section 6.9: (i) will survive the Closing; (ii) is
intended to benefit each CareFirst Company, and the individuals who at or
before the Closing were trustees, directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees
and agents of any CareFirst Company, and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, representatives and successors; and (iii) is in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to immunity,
exculpation, indemnification, contribution or insurance that any such
individual may have by contract or otherwise.   Section 6.10. Hart-Scott-
Rodino Notification.   Each of CareFirst and Purchaser shall prepare and
file on a date agreed to by the parties a notification with the DOJ and the
FTC as required by the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with each other
party in connection with the preparation of such notification, including
sharing information concerning sales and ownership and such other information
as may be needed to complete such notification. The parties further agree to
cooperate with one another to the extent necessary to comply with any
requests by the DOJ or the FTC under the HSR Act for additional information
arising from the notification. Each party shall keep confidential all
information about the other party obtained in connection with the preparation
of such notification or response to requests for additional
information.   Section 6.11. Further Assurances.   Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each of CareFirst and Purchaser agrees to use
its Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be       -29-    done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (a)
the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) obtaining all governmental consents
acquired for the consummation of the Merger, the Conversion and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) making all necessary filings under
the HSR Act. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the
parties agrees to use its Best Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to
satisfy the other conditions of the Closing set forth herein. Each party will
consult with counsel for the other party as to, and will permit such counsel
to participate in, at such other party\'s expense, any lawsuits or
proceedings referred to in clause (a) above brought against any party. In
case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such necessary action
to the extent not inconsistent with their other duties and obligations or
applicable law.   Section 6.12. Public Announcements.   So long as this
Agreement is in effect, each of CareFirst and Purchaser shall not and shall
cause their affiliates not to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or any other announcement with respect to the Merger, the Conversion,
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent
of the other party, except where such release or announcement is required by
applicable law or pursuant to any listing agreement with, or the rules or
regulations of, the SEC or the NYSE, in which case each of CareFirst and
Purchaser will permit review by the other of any such press release or
announcement prior to its release or filing and shall deliver simultaneously
a final copy of such release or announcement to the other upon its release or
filing. CareFirst and Purchaser agree to coordinate their initial press
releases announcing the execution of this Agreement.   Section 6.13.
Appointment of Director of Purchaser; Management Issues.   (a) Effective as
of Closing, Purchaser (after consultation with CareFirst) will nominate for
election one non-employee member of the existing Board of Directors of
CareFirst to serve on Purchaser\'s Board of Directors and will use Best
Efforts to have the CareFirst designee appointed or elected to Purchaser\'s
Board of Directors. In the event that at that time, Purchaser\'s Board of
Directors shall have one or more classes of directors which have fewer
members than one or more other classes of directors, the CareFirst designee
shall be nominated to whichever class with fewer directors provides for the
longest initial term for the CareFirst director.   (b) At the Effective
Time, the Chief Executive Officer of CareFirst shall be named the President
of Purchaser\'s Southeast Business Region with overall responsibility for all

CareFirst will be assigned significant responsibilities with respect to the
business of the Surviving Corporation.     -30-    (c) An advisory
board will be formed for each of BCBS-NCA, BCBS-MD and BCBSD. Each person who
serves as a director of one those companies at Closing, subject to such
person\'s acceptance of such appointment, will serve on the advisory board
for that company, and the current directors of CareFirst who do not currently
serve on the Board of BCBS-NCA, BCBS-MD or BCBSD, subject to such person\'s
acceptance of such appointment, will be appointed to serve on one of the
advisory boards. Each advisory board will provide guidance to its respective
company regarding the company\'s relationship with subscribers (both group
and non-group), providers and the general public. Each director appointed to
an advisory board shall serve for a term of two years from the Closing on the
same terms and conditions currently applicable to such person\'s service on
the Board of Directors of CareFirst, BCBS-NCA, BCBS-MD or BCBSD as of the
date hereof.   Section 6.14. Non-Solicitation.   So long as this
Agreement is in effect, no CareFirst Company shall, and each shall use its
Best Efforts to cause its representatives not to, directly or indirectly,

of capital stock, merger, consolidation, sale or lease of material assets,
affiliation, joint venture, or other material transaction (a "Merger
Proposal"). Neither the foregoing prohibition nor any other provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit CareFirst from (a) making any
disclosure of information required by law, or (b) providing information
regarding CareFirst to, or negotiating with, any third party (provided such
party is subject to an executed confidentiality agreement) that makes an
unsolicited written Merger Proposal if the Board of Directors of CareFirst
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to provide such information or engage in such negotiations
is or is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary
duties under applicable law. Prior to providing any information to any third
party or entering into negotiations with any third party, CareFirst shall
notify Purchaser of the Merger Proposal and shall provide to Purchaser a copy
of the Merger Proposal.   Section 6.15. Resale Registration Statement; NYSE
Listing.   As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall file with the SEC the Resale Registration Statement to
register under the Securities Act the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger for resale by the Tax-Exempt Entities after the Closing.
CareFirst will provide all information, financial and otherwise, concerning
CareFirst as may be needed in the Resale Registration Statement. Purchaser
and CareFirst shall use their Best Efforts to comply, prior to the Effective
Time, with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws
in connection with the Merger and the issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in
connection therewith. Purchaser shall have the Resale Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC on or before the Closing Date and shall
maintain the effectiveness and availability of the Resale Registration
Statement from the Closing Date through the date that is 180 days after the
Closing Date (subject to blackout periods provided for in the registration
rights agreement referred to in the next sentence). On or before the Closing,
Purchaser shall enter into a registration rights agreement with the Tax-
Exempt Entities that shall contain     -31-   customary terms and
provisions (including reasonable blackout periods) and shall provide them
with the following: (1) one demand registration right which right will expire
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (2) unlimited piggy back
registration rights which rights will expire on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser shall promptly file all appropriate
applications with the NYSE to have the Purchaser Common Stock approved for
listing on the NYSE upon notice of issuance.   Section 6.16. Accountant\'s
Letter.   Upon reasonable notice, CareFirst shall use its Best Efforts to
cause its independent public accountants to deliver to Purchaser a letter
dated within two (2) business days prior to the effective time of the
Resale Registration Statement, covering such matters reasonably requested
by Purchaser as are customarily addressed in accountants\' "comfort"
letters.   Section 6.17. Employee Benefits.   (a) From the date hereof
through the fourth anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall not cause or permit any CareFirst Plan
(except the CareFirst 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan) to be amended, suspended
or terminated in any manner that could have any adverse effect on the
benefits or any right of any participant or beneficiary therein (other than
with respect to an employee whose employment is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement), except as required by law or as determined by the
President of CareFirst to be in the best interests of CareFirst. From the
Effective Time through the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation shall not cause or permit the CareFirst of
Maryland, Inc. Retirement Plan, the Non-Contributory Retirement Program for
Certain Employees of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware or the Group
Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. Pension Trust Plan (collectively,
the "CareFirst Pension Plans") to be amended, suspended or terminated in any
manner that could have any adverse effect on benefit accruals during such
five-year period (including any reduction in the rate of accrual) of any
employee who, as of the Closing Date, is a vested participant, has attained
age 45 and has a sum of age and years of service of at least 65. Nothing in
this Section 6.17(a) shall prohibit (i) the merger of any CareFirst Plan with
another plan provided that such merger does not have any adverse effect on
the benefits or rights protected by this Section 6.17(a), or (ii) the
transfer of any person\'s employment from a CareFirst Company to Purchaser or
an Affiliate thereof provided such transfer does not adversely affect
the pension and retirement benefits such employee would otherwise receive
in accordance with and subject to terms and conditions of this Section
6.17(a).   (b) After the requirements of Section 6.17(a) cease to apply to
any CareFirst Plans, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Purchaser Companies or the CareFirst Companies to provide the employees
of the CareFirst Companies (the "CareFirst Employees"), other than those
employees whose employment is covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
benefits that in the aggregate are no less favorable than those provided to
other similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates.    
-32-    (c) Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) in which any
CareFirst Employees first become eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time (the "New CareFirst Plans") to (i) waive all limitations as to
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods thereunder with
respect to the participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
CareFirst Employees and their beneficiaries other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such CareFirst Employees
and that have not been satisfied as of the date on which such CareFirst
Employees first became eligible to participate in such New CareFirst Plan,
(ii) credit such CareFirst Employees and their beneficiaries with the
deductibles, coinsurance amounts or maximum out-of-pocket payments satisfied
under the comparable CareFirst Plans during the same calendar year, and (iii)

-43-    Appendix A   Principal Terms of Plan of Conversion   The board
of directors of CareFirst, Inc. and each of its non-profit subsidiaries
(CareFirst of Maryland, Inc., Group Hospitalization and Medical Services,
Inc. ("GHMSI") and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, Inc. ("BCBSD")) will
adopt a Plan of Conversion providing for the conversion of the companies from
non-profit to for-profit status. For all companies except GHMSI, the
conversion will be accomplished by means of the adoption of amended and
restated articles or certificates of incorporation providing that
the corporation will operate as a for-profit business corporation. The
conversions will be subject to regulatory approval in each of the
jurisdictions listed. GHMSI, a federally chartered corporation, will be re-
chartered in the District of Columbia, which will require approval of the
U.S. Congress. In determining whether to approve the conversion, the
regulators must find that the fair value of the assets has been received and
that the conversion is in the public interest.   Following the amendment of
its charter (or, in the case of GHMSI, its re-chartering), each subsidiary
insurer will issue shares of its Common Stock (which will constitute all of
its issued and outstanding shares) to CareFirst, thus becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CareFirst. CareFirst will then issue to tax-exempt entities in
Maryland, the District of Columbia and Delaware a number of shares of Common
Stock of CareFirst representing the percentage of the aggregate value of
CareFirst represented by the subsidiary insurer of the particular
jurisdiction, as agreed among the regulators in the jurisdictions involved.
Following those issuances, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
CareFirst will be owned by the tax-exempt entities designated by the
regulators in those jurisdictions.   In the Merger, each share of CareFirst
Common Stock will be converted into the Aggregate Per Share Consideration (as
defined in the Merger Agreement).   After the Merger, the Primary CareFirst
Insurers will each continue to provide healthcare services as licensed
insurers to the communities in each of their respective jurisdictions that
they currently serve.    -44-    Appendix B   DEFINITIONS

reserves the right from time  to time to make any amendments of the Charter
which may  now or hereafter be authorized by law, including any  amendments
changing the terms or contract rights, as  expressly set forth in the
Charter, of any of its  outstanding stock by classification, reclassification
or  otherwise.   (b) The enumeration and definition of particular powers 
of the Board of Directors included in the foregoing shall in no  way be
limited or restricted by reference to or inference from  the terms of any
other clause of this or any other Article of the  Charter of the Corporation,
or construed as or deemed by  inference or otherwise in any manner to exclude

-------------------------------------  William L. Jews  President and Chief
Executive Officer   -7-    Appendix E   CAREFIRST, INC.  AMENDED AND
RESTATED BY-LAWS    ARTICLE I.   STOCKHOLDERS   SECTION 1.01. Annual
Meeting. The Corporation shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to
elect directors and transact any other business within its powers, either at
9:00 a.m. on the second Tuesday of May in each year if not a legal holiday,
or at such other time on such other day falling on or before the 30th day
thereafter as shall be set by the Board of Directors. Except as the Charter
or statute provides otherwise, any business may be considered at an annual
meeting without the purpose of the meeting having been specified in the
notice. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the
Corporation\'s existence or affect any otherwise valid corporate acts.  
SECTION 1.02. Special Meeting. At any time in the interval between annual
meetings, a special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman
of the Board or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by
vote at a meeting or in writing (addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation) with or without a meeting. Special meetings of the stockholders
shall be called by the Secretary at the request of the stockholders only on
the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of
all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting and then only as may be
required by law. The Board of Directors shall have sole power to fix the date
and time of the special meeting.   SECTION 1.03. Place of Meetings. Unless
the Charter provides otherwise, meetings of stockholders shall be held at
such place as is set from time to time by the Board of Directors.   SECTION
1.04. Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice. Not less than ten nor more than
90 days before each stockholders\' meeting, the Secretary shall give written
notice of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting and
each other stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting. The notice shall
state the time and place of the meeting and, if the meeting is a special
meeting or notice of the purpose is required by statute, the purpose of the
meeting. Notice is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to
the stockholder, left at the stockholder\'s residence or usual place of
business, or mailed to the stockholder at the stockholder\'s address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation or transmitted to the stockholder
by electronic mail to any electronic mail address of the stockholder or by
any other electronic means. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, each
person who is entitled to notice waives notice if such person before or after
the meeting signs a waiver of the notice which is filed with the records of
stockholders\' meetings, or is present at the meeting in person or by
proxy.     -1-    SECTION 1.05. Quorum; Voting. Unless any statute or
the Charter provides otherwise, at a meeting of stockholders the presence in
person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum, and a majority
of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient
to approve any matter which properly comes before the meeting, except that a
plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is
sufficient to elect a director.   SECTION 1.06. Adjournments. Whether or
not a quorum is present, a meeting of stockholders convened on the date for
which it was called may be adjourned from time to time without further notice
by a majority vote of the stockholders present in person or by proxy to a
date not more than 120 days after the original record date. Any business
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be
deferred and transacted at any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall
be present.   SECTION 1.07. General Right to Vote; Proxies. Unless the
Charter provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share or limits
or denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of
class, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a
meeting of stockholders; however, a share is not entitled to be voted if any
installment payable on it is overdue and unpaid. In all elections for
directors, each share of stock may be voted for as many individuals as there
are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to
be voted. A stockholder may vote the stock the stockholder owns of record
either in person or by proxy. A stockholder may sign a writing authorizing
another person to act as proxy. Signing may be accomplished by the
stockholder or the stockholder\'s authorized agent signing the writing or
causing the stockholder\'s signature to be affixed to the writing by any
reasonable means, including facsimile signature. A stockholder may authorize
another person to act as proxy by transmitting, or authorizing the
transmission of, an authorization by a telegram, cablegram, datagram,
electronic mail or any other electronic or telephonic means to the person
authorized to act as proxy or to any other person authorized to receive the
proxy authorization on behalf of the person authorized to act as the proxy,
including a proxy solicitation firm or proxy support service organization.
Unless a proxy provides otherwise, it is not valid more than 11 months after
its date. A proxy is revocable by a stockholder at any time without condition
or qualification unless the proxy states that it is irrevocable and the proxy
is coupled with an interest. A proxy may be made irrevocable for so long as
it is coupled with an interest. The interest with which a proxy may be
coupled includes an interest in the stock to be voted under the proxy or
another general interest in the Corporation or its assets or liabilities.  
SECTION 1.08. List of Stockholders. At each meeting of stockholders, a full,
true and complete list of all stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting,
showing the number and class of shares held by each and certified by the
transfer agent for such class or by the Secretary, shall be furnished by the
Secretary.   SECTION 1.09. Conduct of Business and Voting. At all meetings
of stockholders, unless the voting is conducted by inspectors, the proxies
and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the qualification
of voters and the validity of proxies, the acceptance or rejection of votes
and procedures for the conduct of business not otherwise specified by
these   -2-    By-Laws, the Charter or law, shall be decided or
determined by the chairman of the meeting. If demanded by stockholders,
present in person or by proxy, entitled to cast 10% in number of votes
entitled to be cast, or if ordered by the chairman of the meeting, the vote
upon any election or question shall be taken by ballot and, upon like demand
or order, the voting shall be conducted by two inspectors, in which event the
proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the
qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or
rejection of votes shall be decided, by such inspectors. Unless so demanded
or ordered, no vote need be by ballot and voting need not be conducted by
inspectors. The stockholders at any meeting may choose an inspector or
inspectors to act at such meeting, and in default of such election the
chairman of the meeting may appoint an inspector or inspectors. No candidate
for election as a director at a meeting shall serve as an inspector
thereat.   SECTION 1.10. Informal Action by Stockholders. Except as
provided below, any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting
of stockholders may be taken without a meeting if a unanimous written
consent which sets forth the action and is signed by each stockholder
entitled to vote on the matter and is filed with the records of stockholders
meetings. Unless the Charter requires otherwise, the holders of any class of
stock other than Common Stock, entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, may take action or consent to any action by the written consent of
stockholders entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a stockholders meeting
if the Corporation gives notice of the action to each stockholder not later
than 10 days after the effective time of the action.   SECTION 1.11.
Meeting by Conference Telephone. Stockholders may participate in a meeting by
means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.
Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence in person at a
meeting.    ARTICLE II.   BOARD OF DIRECTORS   SECTION 2.01. Function
of Directors. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed
under the direction of its Board of Directors. All powers of the Corporation
may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as
conferred on or reserved to the stockholders by statute or by the Charter or
By-Laws.   SECTION 2.02. Number of Directors. The Corporation shall have
at least one director. The Corporation shall have the number of
directors provided in the Charter until changed as herein provided. A
majority of the entire Board of Directors may alter the number of directors
set by the Charter to not exceeding 25 nor less than the minimum number then
permitted herein, but the action may not affect the tenure of office of any
director.   SECTION 2.03. Election and Tenure of Directors. Subject to the
rights of the holders of any class of stock separately entitled to elect one
or more directors, at each annual meeting,     -3-   the stockholders
shall elect directors to hold office until the next annual meeting and until
their successors are elected and qualify.   SECTION 2.04. Removal of
Director. Unless statute or the Charter provides otherwise, the stockholders
may remove any director, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast generally for the election of
directors.   SECTION 2.05. Vacancy on Board of Directors. Subject to the
rights of the holders of any class or series of stock separately entitled to
elect one or more directors, the stockholders may elect a successor to fill a
vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from the removal of a
director. A director elected by the stockholders to fill a vacancy which
results from the removal of a director serves for the balance of the term of
the removed director. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class of
stock separately entitled to elect one or more directors, a majority of
the remaining directors, whether or not sufficient to constitute a quorum,
may fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors which results from any cause
except an increase in the number of directors, and a majority of the entire
Board of Directors may fill a vacancy which results from an increase in the
number of directors. A director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a
vacancy serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or
her successor is elected and qualifies.   SECTION 2.06. Regular Meetings.
After each meeting of stockholders at which directors shall have been
elected, the Board of Directors shall meet as soon thereafter as practicable
for the purpose of organization and the transaction of other business. In the
event that no other time and place are specified by resolution of the Board
of Directors or announced by the President or the Chairman of the Board at
such stockholders meeting, the Board of Directors shall meet immediately
following the close of, and at the place of, such stockholders meeting. Any
other regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held on such date
and time and at such place as may be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors. No notice of such meeting following a stockholders
meeting or any other regular meeting shall be necessary if held as
hereinabove provided.   SECTION 2.07. Special Meetings. Special meetings of
the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board
or the President or by a majority of the Board of Directors by vote at a
meeting, or in writing with or without a meeting. A special meeting of the
Board of Directors shall be held on such date and at any place as may be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. In the absence of
designation such meeting shall be held at such place as may be designated in
the call.   SECTION 2.08. Notice of Meeting. Except as provided in Section
2.06, the Secretary shall give notice to each director of each regular and
special meeting of the Board of Directors. The notice shall state the time
and place of the meeting. Notice is given to a director when it is delivered
personally to him or her, left at his or her residence or usual place of
business, or sent by telegraph, facsimile transmission or telephone, at least
24 hours before the time of the meeting or, in the alternative by mail to his
or her address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation, at least
72 hours before the time of the meeting. Unless these By-Laws or a resolution
of the Board of Directors provides otherwise, the notice need not state
the business to     -4-   be transacted at or the purposes of any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. No notice of any
meeting of the Board of Directors need be given to any director who attends
except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened, or to any director who, in writing executed and
filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding
thereof, waives such notice. Any meeting of the Board of Directors, regular
or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some
other place, and no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting other
than by announcement.   SECTION 2.09. Quorum; Action by Directors. A
majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present by
majority vote and without notice other than by announcement may adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Unless statute or the Charter or By-Laws requires a greater proportion, the
action of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum
is present is action of the Board of Directors. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken
without a meeting, if an unanimous written consent which sets forth the
action is signed by each member of the Board of Directors and filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors.   SECTION 2.10. Meeting
by Conference Telephone. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in
a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications
equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at
the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means constitutes presence
in person at a meeting.   SECTION 2.11. Compensation. By resolution of the
Board of Directors a fixed sum and expenses, if any, for attendance at each
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or of committees
thereof, and other compensation for their services as such or on committees
of the Board of Directors, may be paid to directors. Directors who are full-
time employees of the Corporation need not be paid for attendance at meetings
of the Board of Directors or committees thereof for which fees are paid to
other directors. A director who serves the Corporation in any other capacity
also may receive compensation for such other services, pursuant to a
resolution of the directors.    ARTICLE III.   COMMITTEES   SECTION
3.01. Committees. The Board of Directors may appoint from among its members
an Executive Committee and other committees composed of one or more directors
and delegate to these committees any of the powers of the Board of Directors,
except the power to authorize dividends on stock, elect directors, issue
stock other than as provided in the next sentence, recommend to the
stockholders any action which requires stockholder approval, amend   
-5-   these By-Laws, or approve any merger or share exchange which does not
require stockholder approval. If the Board of Directors has given
general authorization for the issuance of stock providing for or establishing
a method or procedure for determining the maximum number of shares to be
issued, a committee of the Board of Directors, in accordance with that
general authorization or any stock option or other plan or program adopted by
the Board of Directors, may authorize or fix the terms of stock subject
to classification or reclassification and the terms on which any stock may
be issued, including all terms and conditions required or permitted to
be established or authorized by the Board of Directors.   SECTION 3.02.
Committee Procedure. Each committee may fix rules of procedure for its
business. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of those present at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the committee. The
members of a committee present at any meeting, whether or not they constitute
a quorum, may appoint a director to act in the place of an absent member. Any
action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of a committee may be
taken without a meeting, if an unanimous written consent which sets forth the
action is signed by each member of the committee and filed with the minutes
of the committee. The members of a committee may conduct any meeting thereof
by conference telephone in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.10.   SECTION 3.03. Emergency. In the event of a state of disaster
of sufficient severity to prevent the conduct and management of the affairs
and business of the Corporation by its directors and officers as contemplated
by the Charter and these By-Laws, any two or more available members of the
then incumbent Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum of that
Committee for the full conduct and management of the affairs and business of
the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01. In the
event of the unavailability, at such time, of a minimum of two members of the
then incumbent Executive Committee, the available directors shall elect
an Executive Committee consisting of any two members of the Board of
Directors, whether or not they be officers of the Corporation, which two
members shall constitute the Executive Committee for the full conduct and
management of the affairs of the Corporation in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section. This Section shall be subject to implementation
by resolution of the Board of Directors passed from time to time for that
purpose, and any provisions of these By-Laws (other than this Section) and
any resolutions which are contrary to the provisions of this Section or to
the provisions of any such implementary resolutions shall be suspended until
it shall be determined by any interim Executive Committee acting under this
Section that it shall be to the advantage of the Corporation to resume the
conduct and management of its affairs and business under all the other
provisions of these By-Laws.    ARTICLE IV.   OFFICERS   SECTION 4.01.
Executive and Other Officers. The Corporation shall have a President, a
Secretary, and a Treasurer. It may also have a Chairman of the Board. The
Board of Directors     -6-   shall designate who shall serve as chief
executive officer, who shall have general supervision of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may designate a chief operating officer, who
shall have supervision of the operations of the Corporation. In the absence
of any designation the President shall serve as chief executive officer. The

Directors.   SECTION 4.03. President. Unless otherwise specified by the
Board of Directors, the President shall be the chief executive officer of
the Corporation and perform the duties customarily performed by chief
executive officers. He or she may execute, in the name of the Corporation,
all authorized deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts or other instruments,
except in cases in which the signing and execution thereof shall have been
expressly delegated to some other officer or agent of the Corporation. In
general, he or she shall perform such other duties customarily performed by a
president of a corporation and shall perform such other duties and have such
other powers as are from time to time assigned to him or her by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.   SECTION 4.04. Vice-Presidents. The Vice-
President or Vice-Presidents, at the request of the President, or in the
President\'s absence or during his or her inability to act, shall perform the
duties and exercise the functions of the President, and when so acting shall
have the powers of the President. If there be more than one Vice-President,
the Board of Directors may determine which one or more of the Vice-Presidents
shall perform any of such duties or exercise any of such functions, or if
such determination is not made by the Board of Directors, the chief executive
officer, or the President may make such determination; otherwise any of the
Vice-Presidents may perform any of such duties or exercise any of such
functions. Each Vice-President shall perform such other duties and have such
other powers, and have such additional descriptive designations in their
titles (if any), as are from time to time assigned to them by the Board of
Directors or the President.   SECTION 4.05. Secretary. The Secretary shall
keep the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, of the Board of
Directors and of any committees, in books provided for the purpose; he or she
shall see that all notices are duly given in accordance with the provisions
of these By-Laws or as required by law; he or she shall be custodian of the
records of the Corporation; he or she may witness any document on behalf of
the Corporation, the execution of which is duly authorized, see that the
corporate seal is affixed where such document is required or desired to be
under its seal, and, when so affixed, may attest the same. In general, he or
she shall perform such other duties customarily performed by a secretary of a
corporation, and shall     -7-   perform such other duties and have
such other powers as are from time to time assigned to him or her by the
Board of Directors or the President.   SECTION 4.06. Treasurer. The
Treasurer shall have charge of and be responsible for all funds, securities,
receipts and disbursements of the Corporation, and shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, in the name of the Corporation, all moneys or other valuable
effects in such banks, trust companies or other depositories as shall, from
time to time, be selected by the Board of Directors; he or she shall render
to the President and to the Board of Directors, whenever requested, an

shall perform such other duties customarily performed by a treasurer of a
corporation, and shall perform such other duties and have such other powers
as are from time to time assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors or
the President.   SECTION 4.07. Assistant and Subordinate Officers. The
assistant and subordinate officers of the Corporation are all officers below

subordinate officers shall have such duties as are from time to time assigned
to them by the Board of Directors or the President.   SECTION 4.08.
Election, Tenure and Removal of Officers. The Board of Directors shall elect
the officers of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may from time to time
authorize any committee or officer to appoint assistant and subordinate
officers. Election or appointment of an officer, employee or agent shall not
of itself create contract rights. All officers shall be appointed to hold
their offices, respectively, at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors (or, as to any assistant or subordinate officer, any
committee or officer authorized by the Board of Directors) may remove an
officer at any time. The removal of an officer does not prejudice any of his
or her contract rights. The Board of Directors (or, as to any assistant or
subordinate officer, any committee or officer authorized by the Board of
Directors) may fill a vacancy which occurs in any office for the unexpired
portion of the term.   SECTION 4.09. Compensation. The Board of Directors
shall have power to fix the salaries and other compensation and remuneration,
of whatever kind, of all officers of the Corporation. No officer shall be
prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she is
also a director of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may authorize any
committee or officer, upon whom the power of appointing assistant and
subordinate officers may have been conferred, to fix the salaries,
compensation and remuneration of such assistant and subordinate
officers.    ARTICLE V.   DIVISIONAL TITLES   SECTION 5.01. Conferring
Divisional Titles. The Board of Directors may from time to time confer upon
any employee of a division of the Corporation the title of President, Vice
President, Treasurer or Controller of such division or any other title or
titles deemed appropriate, or may authorize the Chairman of the Board or the
President to do so. Any such titles so    -8-   conferred may be
discontinued and withdrawn at any time by the Board of Directors, or by the
Chairman of the Board or the President if so authorized by the Board of
Directors. Any employee of a division designated by such a divisional title
shall have the powers and duties with respect to such division as shall be
prescribed by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the
President.   SECTION 5.02. Effect of Divisional Titles. The conferring
of divisional titles shall not create an office of the Corporation under
Article IV unless specifically designated as such by the Board of Directors;
but any person who is an officer of the Corporation may also have a
divisional title.    ARTICLE VI.   STOCK   SECTION 6.01. Certificates
for Stock. Each stockholder is entitled to certificates which represent and
certify the shares of stock he or she holds in the Corporation. Each stock
certificate shall include on its face the name of the Corporation, the name
of the stockholder or other person to whom it is issued, and the class of
stock and number of shares it represents. It shall be in such form, not
inconsistent with law or with the Charter, as shall be approved by the Board
of Directors or any officer or officers designated for such purpose by
resolution of the Board of Directors. Each stock certificate shall be signed
by the Chairman of the Board, the President, or a Vice-President, and
countersigned by the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer, or an
Assistant Treasurer. Each certificate may be sealed with the actual corporate
seal or a facsimile of it or in any other form and the signatures may be
either manual or facsimile signatures. A certificate is valid and may be
issued whether or not an officer who signed it is still an officer when it is
issued. A certificate may not be issued until the stock represented by it is
fully paid.   SECTION 6.02. Transfers. The Board of Directors shall have
power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem
expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates of
stock; and may appoint transfer agents and registrars thereof. The duties of
transfer agent and registrar may be combined.   SECTION 6.03. Record Dates
or Closing of Transfer Books. The Board of Directors may, and shall have the
sole power to, set a record date or direct that the stock transfer books be
closed for a stated period for the purpose of making any proper determination
with respect to stockholders, including which stockholders are entitled to
request a special meeting of stockholders, notice of a meeting of
stockholders, vote at a meeting of stockholders, receive a dividend, or be
allotted other rights. The record date may not be prior to the close of
business on the day the record date is fixed nor, subject to Section 1.06,
more than 90 days before the date on which the action requiring
the determination will be taken; the transfer books may not be closed for a
period longer than 20 days; and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders,
the record date or the closing of the transfer books shall be at least ten
days before the date of the meeting. Any shares of the Corporation\'s own
stock acquired by the Corporation between the record date for    
-9-   determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders and the time of the meeting may be voted at the
meeting by the holder of record as of the record date and shall be counted in
determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at
the meeting.   SECTION 6.04. Stock Ledger. The Corporation shall maintain a
stock ledger which contains the name and address of each stockholder and the
number of shares of stock of each class which the stockholder holds. The
stock ledger may be in written form or in any other form which can be
converted within a reasonable time into written form for visual inspection.
The original or a duplicate of the stock ledger shall be kept at the offices

to seek indemnification (the "Indemnified Party"). The right to
indemnification and advances hereunder shall be enforceable by
the Indemnified Party in any court of competent jurisdiction, if (i)
the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or (ii) no
disposition thereof is made within 60 days. The Indemnified Party\'s costs
and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her
right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also
be reimbursed by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any action for
advance for expenses that (a) a determination has been made that the facts
then known to those making the determination would preclude indemnification
or (b) the Corporation has not received both (i) an undertaking as required
by law to repay such advances in the event it shall ultimately be determined
that the standard of conduct has not been met and (ii) a written affirmation
by the Indemnified Party of such Indemnified Party\'s good faith belief that
the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation has
been met.   SECTION 8.02. Exclusivity, Etc. The indemnification and advance
of expenses provided by the Charter and these By-Laws shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking
indemnification or advance of expenses may be entitled under any law (common
or statutory), or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or other provision that is consistent with law, both as to action
in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation,
shall continue in respect of all events occurring while a person was a
director or officer after such person has ceased to be a director or officer,
and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and
administrators of such person. The Corporation shall not be liable for any
payment under this By-Law in connection with a claim made by a director or
officer to the     -11-   extent such director or officer has otherwise
actually received payment under insurance policy, agreement, vote or
otherwise, of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. All rights to
indemnification and advance of expenses under the Charter of the Corporation
and hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and
each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such
capacity at any time while this By-Law is in effect. Nothing herein shall
prevent the amendment of this By-Law, provided that no such amendment shall
diminish the rights of any person hereunder with respect to events occurring
or claims made before its adoption or as to claims made after its adoption in
respect of events occurring before its adoption. Any repeal or modification
of this By-Law shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification or
advance of expenses of such director or officer or the obligations of the
Corporation arising hereunder with respect to events occurring, or claims
made, while this By-Law or any provision hereof is in force.   SECTION
8.03. Severability; Definitions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Article VIII shall not affect the validity or

Corporation, which shall be in the charge of the Secretary. The Board of

regulation relating to a corporate seal to place the word "(seal)" adjacent
to the signature of the person authorized to sign the document on behalf of
the Corporation.   SECTION 9.03. Bonds. The Board of Directors may require

executed, acknowledged, or verified by more than one officer.   SECTION
9.07. Amendments. Subject to the special provisions of Section 2.02, any and
all provisions of these By-Laws may be repealed, altered, amended or
rescinded and new by-laws may be adopted (a) by the stockholders at any
annual meeting of the stockholders, or at any special meeting called for that

the Company is merged or the successor Person to which such conveyance,
transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may
exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Note with the same
effect as if such successor had been named as the Company herein; and
thereafter the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants

Events of Default.   An "Event of Default" occurs if:   (1) the Company
defaults in the payment of interest on the Note when the same becomes due and
payable, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by Article 6 hereof,
and such failure continues for 60 days after receipt by the Company of a
Notice of Default;   (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the
principal amount when the same becomes due and payable at the Stated Maturity
or upon redemption, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by
Article 6 hereof;   (3) the Company fails to comply with any of its
agreements or covenants herein (other than those referred to in clauses (1)
and (2) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after receipt by the
Company of a Notice of Default;   (4) a decree or order by a court having
jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Company a
bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking
reorganization of the Company under any Bankruptcy Law, and such decree or
order shall have continued undischarged and unstayed for a period of 60
consecutive days; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the
premises of the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or trustee or
assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or of its property, or
for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered,
and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged and
unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days; or   (5) the Company shall
institute proceedings to be adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt, or shall
consent to the filing of a bankruptcy proceeding against it, or shall file a
petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization under any Bankruptcy
Law, or shall consent to the filing of any such petition, or shall consent to
the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or trustee or assignee in
bankruptcy or insolvency of it or of its property or shall make an assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay
its debts generally as they become due.   A Default under clause (3) above
is not an Event of Default until the holders of at least 25% of the then-
outstanding principal amount of the Securities notify the Company of the
Default and the Company does not cure such Default (and such Default is not
waived) within the 60 days after actual receipt of such notice (a "Notice of
Default"). Any such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be
remedied and state that such notice is a Notice of Default.     -8-   
Section 5.2 Acceleration.   If an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default specified in clause (4) or (5) of Section 5.1 hereof) occurs and is
continuing, the holders of at least 25% of the then-outstanding principal
amount of the Securities, by notice to the Company may declare the
outstanding principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest thereon to
the date of declaration to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest shall
become and be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified
in clause (4) or (5) of Section 5.1 hereof occurs and is continuing, the
principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest shall become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part
of the holder. The holders of a majority of the then-outstanding principal
amount of the Securities, by notice to the Company, may rescind an
acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured
or waived except nonpayment of the principal amount and interest thereon that
has become due solely as a result of acceleration. No such rescission shall
affect any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any
consequent right.   Section 5.3 Other Remedies.   If an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the holder may pursue any available remedy to
collect the payment of the outstanding principal amount and any accrued but
unpaid interest on this Note or to enforce the performance of any provision
hereof.   A delay or omission by the holder in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy
or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No
remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are
cumulative.   Section 5.4 Waiver of Past Defaults.   The holders of a
majority of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Securities, by
notice to the Company, may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and
its consequences except (1) an Event of Default described in clause (1), (2)
or (3) of Section 5.1 or, (2) a Default in respect of a provision that under
Section 7.2 hereof cannot be amended without the consent of each holder
affected. When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is deemed cured,
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event
of Default or impair any consequent right.   Section 5.5 Undertaking for
Costs.   In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Note, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the
court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including
reasonable     -9-   attorneys\' fees and expenses, against any party
litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 5.5 does not
apply to a suit by the holder for the enforcement of the payment of the
principal amount or accrued but unpaid interest on or after the due date.  
Section 5.6 Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.   The Company covenants
(to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time
insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which would prohibit or
forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal amount or
any interest thereon, as contemplated herein, or which may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Note.   ARTICLE 6  SUBORDINATION  
Section 6.1 Agreement of Subordination.   The obligations arising from this
Note and the other Securities shall rank pari passu with those of the
Company\'s $260,000,000 principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible
Subordinated Debentures Due 2019 issued under an Indenture dated as of July
2, 1999, as such Indenture may be amended from time to time.   The payment
of the principal amount or interest thereon in respect of this Note shall, to
the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and
subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash or other
payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Note or
thereafter incurred, or thereafter created, assumed or guaranteed.   No
provision of this Article 6 shall prevent the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default hereunder.   Section 6.2 Notice to the Holders   The
Company shall give prompt written notice to the holder of any fact known to
the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment of monies in
respect of this Note pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6, but
failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of
the Securities to the Senior Indebtedness as provided in this Article 6.  
Section 6.3 Payments to the Holder.   No payment shall be made with respect
to the payment of any principal or interest on this Note, if:    
-10-    (i) a default in any payment obligations in respect of
Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing, without regard to
any applicable period of grace (whether at maturity or at a date fixed for
payment or by declaration or otherwise); or   (ii) any other default occurs
and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness that permits
the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness as to which such default
relates to accelerate its maturity and the Company receives a notice of the
default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a holder, or a representative of
holders, of Designated Senior Indebtedness.   If the Company receives any
Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to clause (ii) above, no subsequent Payment
Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and
until at least 365 days shall have elapsed since the initial effectiveness of
the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default that
existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage
Notice to the Company shall be the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage
Notice (it being acknowledged that (x) any action of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries occurring subsequent to delivery of a Payment Blockage
Notice that would give rise to any event of default pursuant to any provision
of Senior Indebtedness under which an event of default previously existed (or
was continuing at the time of delivery of such Payment Blockage Notice) shall
constitute a new event of default for this purpose and (y) any breach of a
financial covenant giving rise to a nonpayment default for a period ending
subsequent to the date of delivery of the respective Payment Blockage Notice
shall constitute a new event of default for this purpose).   The Company
may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of this
Note:   (1) in case of a default referred to in clause (i) above, the
earlier of the date upon which the default is cured or waived in accordance
with the terms of the governing instrument or ceases to exist, or   (2) in
the case of a default referred to in clause (ii) above, the earlier of the
date upon which the default is cured, waived in accordance with the terms of
the governing instrument or ceases to exist or 179 days pass after the
applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received if the maturity of such
Designated Senior Indebtedness has not been accelerated, unless this Article
6 otherwise prohibits the payment or distribution at the time of such payment
or distribution.   Upon any payment by the Company or distribution of assets
of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or
reorganization or bankruptcy of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary, or insolvency, receivership or similar proceedings relating to
the Company or its property, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors or
any marshaling of the Company\'s assets or liabilities, all amounts due or to
become due upon all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be paid in
full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such
Senior     -11-   Indebtedness before any payment is made on account of
the principal or interest in respect of this Note, and upon any such
dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization or bankruptcy of
the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or insolvency, receivership or
similar proceedings relating to the Company or its property, or an assignment
for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company\'s assets or
liabilities, any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the
Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to
which the holder of this Note would be entitled, except for the provisions of
this Article 6, shall (except as aforesaid) be paid by the Company or by any
receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, or by the holder of this Note if
received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Company, as their respective interests may appear, or their representative or
representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant
to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have
been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent
necessary to pay all such Senior Indebtedness in full in cash or other
payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, after giving
effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made to the
holders of this Note or the other Securities..   In the event that,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any payment or distribution of
assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities (including, without limitation, by way of setoff or otherwise),
prohibited by the foregoing provisions in this Section 6.3, shall be received
by the holder of this Note before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is
paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such
Senior Indebtedness, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for
the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Company or their representative or representatives, or to
the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments
evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their
respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company, for
application to the payment of all such Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid
to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Indebtedness in full in cash
or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness.   For purposes of this Article 6, the
words cash, property or securities shall not be deemed to include shares of
stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the
Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or
readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated, at least to the extent
provided in this Article 6 with respect to this Note, to the payment of all
Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at the time be outstanding;
provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation,
if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the
rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (other than leases that are
not assumed by the Company or the new corporation, as the case may be) are
not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or
readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another corporation shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-
up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section
6.3.     -12-    Section 6.4 Subrogation   Subject to the payment in
full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the rights of the
holder of this Note shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such
Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or
securities of the Company applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the
principal and interest on this Note shall be paid in full; and, for the
purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the
holder of this Note would be entitled except for the provisions of this
Article 6, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article 6,
to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness by the
holder of this Note, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than
holders of its Senior Indebtedness, and the holder of this Note be deemed to
be a payment by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness; and
no payments or distributions of cash, property or securities to or for the
benefit of the holder of this Note pursuant to the subrogation provisions of
this Article 6, which would otherwise have been paid to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or for the
account of this Note. It is understood that the provisions of this Article 6
are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights
of the holder of this Note, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, on the other hand.   Nothing contained in this Article 6 or
elsewhere herein is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its
creditors other than the holders of its Senior Indebtedness and the holder of
this Note, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the holder of this Note the principal and interest
in respect of this Note as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of the holder of this Note and creditors of the Company other than the
holders of its Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein
prevent the holder of this Note from exercising all remedies otherwise
permitted by applicable law upon default under this Note, subject to the
rights, if any, under this Article 6 of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in
respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the
exercise of any such remedy.   Section 6.5 No Impairment of
Subordination.   No right of any present or future holder of any Senior
Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall
at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by (i) any amendment of or
addition or supplement to any such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument or
agreement relating thereto (unless otherwise expressly provided therein), or
(ii) any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or
failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by
the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of the instrument,
regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or
otherwise be charged with or (iii) a failure to act by the holder of this
Note or the failure of such holder to comply with this Note.    
-13-    Section 6.6 Reliance By Holders Of Senior Indebtedness
On Subordination Provisions.   The holder of this Note by such holder\'s
acceptance hereof, acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination
provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to
each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior
Indebtedness was created, assumed or acquired before or after the date
hereof, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior
Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed
conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and
continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness, and
no amendment or modification of the provisions contained herein shall
diminish the rights of such holder or holders unless such holder or holders
shall have agreed in writing thereto.   Section 6.7 Reinstatement of
Subordination.   If, at any time, all or part of any payment of any
Senior Indebtedness theretofore made by the Company or any other Person is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or such other
Person), these subordination provisions shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, all as though such payment had not been
made.   Section 6.8 Permitted Payments.   Nothing contained in this
Article 6 or elsewhere herein shall prevent the Company at any time, except
under the conditions described in Section 6.3 hereof, from making payments at
any time of principal or interest in respect of this Note, if such payment
would not have been prohibited by the provisions of Section 6.3 hereof.  
Section 6.9 Reliance On Judicial Order Or Certificate Of
Liquidating Agent.   Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the
Company referred to in this Article 6, the holder of this Note shall be
entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent
jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is
pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee,
custodian, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other
Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the holder of this
Note, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in
such payment or distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other
indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the
amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article 6.    -14-    ARTICLE 7  Amendments

___________, 2002  WellPoint Health Networks, Inc. One WellPoint
Way Thousand Oaks, CA 91362  Ladies and Gentlemen:   Pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November __, 2001 (the
"Merger Agreement"), among WellPoint Health Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser"), CareFirst, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("CareFirst") and CF Acquisition Corporation, a Maryland corporation and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub will
merge with and into CareFirst. Immediately following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and CareFirst shall continue as
the surviving corporation under the name CareFirst, Inc. Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement.   The undersigned has been advised that as of the date the Merger
is submitted to stockholders of CareFirst for approval the undersigned may be
an "affiliate" of CareFirst, as the term is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), although nothing contained herein shall be construed as an
admission of such fact, or as a waiver of any rights that the undersigned may
have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or
after the date of this letter agreement.   As a result of the Merger, the
undersigned will receive Purchaser Common Stock in exchange for shares owned
by the undersigned of CareFirst Common Stock.   The undersigned hereby
represents, warrants and covenants with and to Purchaser that:   The
undersigned understands that an investment in Purchaser  Common Stock
acquired as a result of the Merger is highly  speculative and involves
substantial economic risk. The undersigned  understands that    -1-   
it must bear the economic risk of this investment indefinitely  unless the
Purchaser Common Stock is registered pursuant to the  Securities Act, or an
exemption from registration is available, and  that the undersigned may
sustain, and is financially able to  sustain, a complete loss of its
investment in the Purchaser. The  undersigned understands that there is no
assurance that any  exemption from registration under the Securities Act will
be  available and that, even if available, such exemption may not allow  the
undersigned to transfer all or any portion of the Purchaser  Common Stock
under the circumstances, in the amounts or at the times  the undersigned
might propose.    The undersigned represents that, by reason of its or of
its  management\'s business or financial experience, the undersigned has 
the capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the 
transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.    The undersigned
acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser  Common Stock must be held
indefinitely unless it is subsequently  registered under the Securities Act
or an exemption from such  registration is available.    The undersigned
will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Purchaser Common Stock
received in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition
has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or
other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (as such rule may hereafter from time to time be amended)
or (iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, or under a "no-action" or interpretive letter
obtained by the undersigned from the Commission specifically issued with
respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, such
sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Securities Act.    The undersigned understands
and agrees that this letter agreement shall apply to all shares of the
capital stock of CareFirst that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the
undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws.    The
undersigned has carefully read this letter agreement and discussed its
requirements and other applicable limitations upon the undersigned\'s ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of Purchaser, to
the extent the undersigned felt necessary, with the undersigned\'s counsel or
counsel for CareFirst, as applicable.     -2-    This letter agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware.     Very truly yours,   [SIGNATORY]

H     INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT    THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is
made and entered into this ____ day of ____________, by and among _______,
_______ and _______ (collectively, the "Tax Exempt Entities"), CareFirst,
Inc., a Maryland corporation ("CareFirst"), and Wellpoint Health Networks
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Wellpoint").   WHEREAS, CareFirst, Wellpoint
and Congress Acquisition Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Congress"),
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of ________, 2001
(as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified, the "Merger
Agreement") which provides that Congress will merge with and into CareFirst
(the "Merger");   WHEREAS, prior to the Merger, CareFirst converted its
Primary CareFirst Insurers (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from not-for-
profit to for-profit status and issued 100% of its outstanding shares of
capital stock to the Tax Exempt Entities (collectively, the
"Conversion");   WHEREAS, CareFirst has received an Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") private letter ruling dated _________, that the Conversion qualifies
as a tax free reorganization and that no gain or loss will be recognized by
CareFirst from the Conversion for Federal income tax purposes (the "IRS
Ruling");   WHEREAS, it is a condition to Wellpoint\'s obligation to
consummate the Merger that the Tax Exempt Entities enter into this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Tax Exempt Entities are the beneficiaries of
an insurance policy issued by _____________ (the "Insurance Policy") covering
any liability of the Tax Exempt Entities that may arise under this
Agreement.   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties hereto agree as follows:  1. Indemnity. Each Tax Exempt Entity
agrees to indemnify, defend and save Wellpoint, CareFirst and their
respective affiliates harmless from and against such Tax Exempt Entity\'s Pro
Rata Share (as defined below) of the net amount of Federal income tax
liabilities (together with any penalties, interest, fines and additions to
tax, but not taxes, if any, resulting from the receipt of indemnity payments
by CareFirst pursuant to this Agreement) incurred by CareFirst, as a result
of a revocation or modification, in whole or in part, of the IRS Ruling;
provided, however, that the Tax Exempt Entities shall have no liability under
this Agreement if the revocation or modification, of the IRS Ruling is a
result of (i) actions taken by CareFirst or Wellpoint following the Merger,
without the consent of the Tax Exempt Entities or (ii) the transaction not
being consummated (other than due to actions taken by the Tax Exempt
Entities) in accordance with the terms set forth in the IRS Ruling or the
request for the IRS Ruling CareFirst or Wellpoint shall promptly notify the
Tax Exempt Entities of any assertion by the IRS of a tax liability for which
the Tax Exempt Entities may be responsible under this Agreement. The
Tax Exempt Entities shall have the opportunity to participate jointly
with Wellpoint and CareFirst in contesting any such asserted tax liability.
The settlement of any claim which would result in a payment by the Tax
Exempt     2   Entities under this Agreement without the Tax Exempt
Entities\' written consent shall constitute a waiver of the right to
indemnity; provided, however, the Tax Exempt Entities shall not unreasonably
withhold their consent to any settlement.  2. Miscellaneous. 
-------------   (a) Financial Assurances. Each Tax Exempt Entity covenants
and agrees that during the term of this Agreement it will have assets or
other available resources sufficient to satisfy any liability or obligation
it may have under this Agreement.   (b) Further Agreements. No party to
this Agreement will take any position inconsistent with the IRS Ruling or the
request for the IRS Ruling.   (c) Termination. This Agreement shall
terminate on the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the
taxable year in which the Conversion occurs. This Agreement shall also
terminate automatically in the event CareFirst is audited by the IRS, the
relevant tax year is closed and the IRS determines that no tax is due with
respect to the Conversion.   (d) No Setoff. No payment required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to any right of setoff,
counterclaim, defense, abatement, suspension, deferment or reduction on an
unrelated claim.   (e) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any term
hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally or in writing,
except that any term of this Agreement may be amended by writing signed by
each of the parties hereto, and the observance of any such term may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively) by a writing signed by the party against whom such waiver
is to be asserted.   (f) Notices. All notices and other communications
provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in accordance with the
notice provisions of the Merger Agreement.   (g) Successors and Assigns.
This Agreement (or any right or obligation hereunder) may not be assigned by
any party without the prior written consent of the other parties (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), except that each of CareFirst
and Wellpoint may assign its rights and obligations in this Agreement,
whether by a writing or operation of law, to a successor to all or
substantially all of its business without such consent in which event this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successor.
This Agreement shall not be binding upon any person who receives a gift,
grant or distribution by a Tax Exempt Entity made in furtherance of the
purposes which form the basis for its exemption from federal income tax.  
(h) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed within the State.   (i) Waiver,
Remedies. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right, power or privilege
hereunder operate as a waiver of any other        3   right, power
or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. The
waiver or consent (whether express or implied) by any party of the breach of
any term or condition of this Agreement shall not prejudice any remedy of any
other party in respect of any continuing or other breach of the terms and
conditions hereof, and shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy
which any party would otherwise have on any future occasion under this
Agreement.   (j) Attorneys\' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to
enforce any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof is
validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs in addition to any other
available remedy.   (k) Severability . In the event that any one or more of
the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any
circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reasons, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision
in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in
