RECITALS

  

WHEREAS, each of NYSE Group and Euronext desire to effect a
strategic combination of their businesses;

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the parties hereto propose that, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement: (a)
Holdco (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Holdco) shall make an offer (the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares, nominal value
1 per share (it being understood that the nominal value may change as a
result of proposal 3(e) of the annual general meeting of Euronext held on May
23, 2006 regarding the Special Euronext Distribution), of Euronext (the "
_Euronext Shares_ "), for a combination of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Holdco (" _Holdco Common Stock_ ") and cash; and (b)
concurrently with the purchase by Holdco (or a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Holdco) of the Euronext Shares pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub shall
merge with and into NYSE Group, with NYSE Group surviving the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the " _Merger_ "), and, in the
Merger, each share of NYSE Group Common Stock shall be converted into the
right to receive one share of Holdco Common Stock;

  

WHEREAS, the parties agree that, prior to the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger, Euronext shall be permitted to pay to the Euronext
shareholders its previously announced special distribution (or a reduction of
capital if such reduction shall not delay the commencement of the Offer) of
3 per Euronext Share (the " _Special Euronext Distribution_ ");

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of NYSE Group, Holdco and
Merger Sub have each determined that the Merger and the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consistent with, and will
further, the respective business strategies and goals of its company, and are
in the best interests of their respective companys stockholders and,
therefore, have approved the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of
Euronext (together, the " _Euronext Boards_ ") have each determined that the
Merger and the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consistent with, and will further, the business strategies
and goals of Euronext, and are in the best interests of

        
   

  



  

Euronext, its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and, therefore,
have approved the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization";

  

WHEREAS, consistent with the business strategies and goals of Holdco
as determined by its Board of Directors following the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger, it is the intention of the parties that (i)
Holdcos marketplaces will leverage the best of NYSE Group and Euronexts
collective technology sourced in an efficient manner to realize expected
synergies of the combination, (ii) Holdco will continue to operate the
horizontal business model under which both NYSE Group and Euronext currently
operate; (iii) market participants in each of the combined companys
marketplaces will be regulated in accordance with applicable local
requirements; and (iv) Holdcos management committee will consist of an equal
number of U.S. and non-U.S. members as further described herein; and

  

WHEREAS, each of the parties hereto desires to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  

# **ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER**

  

## Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

  

### (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Article IX, and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Annex II hereto, as promptly as practicable,
Holdco shall (or shall cause another direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Holdco to) file the Offer with the French Financial Market
Authority ( _Autorit e des Marches Financiers_) __ (the " _AMF_ ") within the
meaning of the General Rules of the AMF, as may be amended from time to time
(the " _GRAMF_ ", which term shall be deemed to include any other relevant
rules, instructions and/or recommendations of the AMF). Following approval by
the AMF of the terms of the Offer and the Tender Offer Prospectus ( _Note d
Information_), Holdco shall commence, within the meaning of the GRAMF, the
Offer to exchange each Euronext Share for 0.98 of a share of Holdco Common
Stock (the " _Standard Stock Amount_ ") and 21.32 in cash (the "
_Standard Cash Amount_ " and, together with the Standard Stock Amount, the "
_Mixed Offer Consideration_ " ( _offre mixte principale_ )) with an option to
receive in the Offer, in lieu

  



        
   

  



  

### of the Mixed Offer Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration (in
the _offre d echange subsidiaire_) or the Cash Election Consideration (in
the _offre d achat subsidiaire_), as each may be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 1.1. In the event that Holdco shall cause a Subsidiary of Holdco to
file and commence the Offer, each reference to Holdco in this Article I and
_Annexes II_ and _III_  shall be deemed, where applicable, to refer to such
Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Mixed Offer
Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash
Election Consideration shall be reduced as a result of the payment by
Euronext of the Special Euronext Distribution.

  

### (b) Subject to Section 1.1(h), each Euronext Share accepted by Holdco
pursuant to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive from Holdco
the Mixed Offer Consideration; _provided_ that Holdco shall provide the
Euronext shareholders with a "mix and match election" in the Offer so that
each holder of Euronext Share may elect to receive in the Offer for each
Euronext Share tendered by such holder in the Offer, in lieu of the Mixed
Offer Consideration, either:

  

#### (i) a number of shares of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Stock Election
Amount_ ") equal to the sum of (A) Standard Stock Amount and (B) the
quotient obtained by dividing the Standard Cash Amount by the Pre-Offering
Stock Price (such consideration, the " _Stock Election Consideration_ "
and persons who shall have tendered their Euronext Shares in this offer (
_offre d echange subsidiaire_) for the Stock Election Consideration are
referred to as having made a " _Stock Election_ "); or

  

#### (ii) an amount in cash (the " _Cash Election Amount_ "), without
interest, equal to the sum of (A) the Standard Cash Amount and (B) the
product obtained by multiplying the Standard Stock Amount by the Pre-Offering
Stock Price (such consideration, the " _Cash Election Consideration_ " and
persons who shall have tendered their Euronext Shares in this offer ( _offre
d achat subsidiaire_) for the Cash Election Consideration are referred to as
having made a " _Cash Election_ ").

  

### (c) For purposes of this Section 1.1:

  

#### (i) the " _Cash Percentage_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the Standard Cash Amount by (y) the sum of (A) the Standard Cash Amount
and (B) the product obtained by multiplying the Pre-Offering Stock Price by
the Standard Stock Amount;

  

#### (ii) the " _Stock Percentage_ " means the fraction obtained by
subtracting the Cash Percentage from one;

  

#### (iii) the " _Ratio_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash
Percentage by the Stock Percentage;

  

#### (iv) the " _Pre-Offering Stock Price_ " means the volume weighted
average price of NYSE Group Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for
the

  



        
   

  



  

#### Pre-Offering Period, converted into euros using the average of the daily
noon buying rates for euros, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, for the Pre-Offering Period; and

  

#### (v) the " _Pre-Offering Period_ " means the ten (10) consecutive trading
days ending on the day immediately prior to the filing of the Offer with the
AMF pursuant to Section 1.1(a) or ending on such other date as mutually
agreed between Euronext and NYSE Group.

  

### (d) Notwithstanding Section 1.1(b), the number of Euronext Shares for
which a Stock Election (the " _Stock Election Shares_ ") and the number of
Euronext Shares for which a Cash Election shall be made (the " _Cash Election
Shares_ ") shall be subject to an adjustment mechanism designed to ensure
that, in the aggregate in the Offer, the quotient obtained by dividing the
Cash Election Shares by the Stock Election Shares shall equal the Ratio.  If
the Cash Election Shares divided by the Stock Election Shares tendered in the
Offer is not equal to the Ratio, then one of the following pro-ration and
allocation adjustments shall occur:

  

#### (i) If the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Election Shares by the
Stock Election Shares exceeds the Ratio, then (A) each holder of a
Stock Election Share shall receive in the Offer the Stock Election
Consideration in respect of such Stock Election Share, and (B) the number of
Cash Election Shares shall be reduced to the number required to achieve the
Ratio (with such reduction to be pro rata among the holders of Euronext
Shares who have made the Cash Election, based on the number of Euronext
Shares for which they have made the Cash Election). The adjusted number of
Cash Election Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Cash Election
Share. All Euronext Shares deemed not to be Cash Election Shares as a result
of this pro-ration and allocation shall not be deemed to be Cash Election
Shares or Stock Election Shares and shall receive the Mixed
Offer Consideration.

  

#### (ii) If the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Election Shares by
the Stock Election Shares is less than the Ratio, then (A) each holder of a
Cash Election Share shall receive in the Offer the Cash Election
Consideration in respect of such Cash Election Share, and (B) the number of
Stock Election Shares shall be reduced to the number required to achieve the
Ratio (with such reduction to be pro rata among the holders of Euronext
Shares who have made the Stock Election, based on the number of Euronext
Shares for which they have made the Stock Election). The adjusted number of
Stock Election Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Stock
Election Share. All Euronext Shares deemed not to be Stock Election Shares as
a result of this pro-ration and allocation shall not be deemed to be Cash
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares and shall receive the Mixed
Offer Consideration.

  

### (e) After the filing and commencement of the Offer as set forth in
Section 1.1(a), Holdcos obligation to accept for exchange or payment, and to
exchange or

  



        
   

  



  

### pay for, any Euronext Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
applicable Laws, the " _Expiration Time_ ") shall be subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex III_
, including the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Offer prior to the Expiration Time and not withdrawn,
in each case in accordance with applicable Laws, a number of Euronext Shares
that represents at least two-thirds of the outstanding Euronext Shares as of
the closing of the Offer, as it may be extended by Holdco in accordance
with applicable Laws (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that, after consultation with Euronext, Holdco may change the Minimum
Condition so that it is a number of Euronext Shares that represents not less
than a majority of the Euronext Shares and not less than a majority of the
Euronext voting power, in each case outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis as
of the closing of the Offer, as it may be extended by Holdco in accordance
with applicable Laws. As used in this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Basis_ "
means, as of any particular time, the number of Euronext Shares issued and
outstanding at such time after taking into account all Euronext Shares
issuable upon the conversion of Euronexts convertible securities or upon the
exercise of any options, warrants or rights to purchase or subscribe for
shares of the capital stock of Euronext.

  

### (f) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been earlier terminated
in accordance with Article IX, and subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Annex III_ in accordance with the
terms of _Annex III_ , Holdco shall promptly consummate the Offer in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, and accept for exchange and
payment, and exchange and pay for, all Euronext Shares tendered and not
withdrawn in accordance with applicable Law, promptly following the
acceptance of Euronext Shares for exchange and payment pursuant to the Offer.
Holdco expressly reserves the right to increase the Standard Stock Amount
and/or the Standard Cash Amount; _provided_ that any such increase shall be
reflected in the Offer Documents or any amendment thereof and filed with the
SEC and the AMF, in each case as required by applicable Law.

  

### (g) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, NYSE
Group and Holdco shall prepare, and Holdco shall file with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), a registration statement
on Form S-4 (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") to register the offer and sale of Holdco Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. The Registration Statement will
include a proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ")
to be used for the NYSE Group Stockholders Meeting to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger (as well as the issuance of the shares of Holdco
Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger) and to be used as a prospectus for
the Offer; _provided_ that, at its option, NYSE Group may file the proxy

Document_ "). As

  



        
   

  



  

### soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Annex II_, (i) Holdco and Euronext shall jointly file with the
AMF a Tender Offer Prospectus ( _Note d Information_) in accordance with the
GRAMF and the related letter of transmittal form and other ancillary
documents with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto and the Holdco Share Registration Document
and any update of the Euronext Share Registration Document, the " _French
Exchange Offer Documents_ "), and (ii) Holdco shall file with the SEC a
prospectus pursuant to Rule 424 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), that will contain or incorporate by
reference all or part of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the related
letter of transmittal form and all other ancillary documents with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Prospectus_ ") (the Prospectus, the Registration Statement and such
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _U.S. Exchange Offer
Documents_ " and, together with the French Exchange Offer Documents, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). The parties hereto agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Registration Statement, the Share Registration Document, the French
Exchange Offer Documents and the U.S. Exchange Offer Documents to be filed
with the SEC and the AMF, as applicable, and disseminated to holders of
NYSE Group Common Stock and Euronext Shares, as applicable, as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. The parties agree to correct promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The parties further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be

Stock and Euronext Shares, as applicable, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law.

  

### (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional
shares of Holdco Common Stock will be issued to the Euronext Shareholders in
the Offer. Any tendering holder who would be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Holdco Common Stock but for this Section 1.1(h) shall instead
receive a cash payment representing such holders proportionate interest in
the net proceeds from the sale on a regulated market for the account of the
tendering shareholders of the aggregate fractional shares of Holdco Common
Stock that the tendering holders otherwise would have received. Any such sale
shall be made within ten (10) business days or such shorter period as may be
required by applicable Law after the settlement of the Offer by an agent
designated by Holdco. In no event will interest be paid on the cash to be
received in lieu of any fraction of a share of Holdco Common Stock.

  

### (i) NYSE Group and Euronext may agree to split the Offer into two or more
separate exchange offers, including a separate U.S. offer and a non-U.S.
offer. If the Offer shall be split into multiple exchange offers, each
reference to the "Offer" set forth in this Agreement and the Annexes hereto
shall refer to each of these separate offers unless the context otherwise
requires.

  



        
   

  



  

### (j) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, Holdco shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the Mixed Offer Consideration, Stock Election Consideration
and Cash Election Consideration payable to any tendering holder of Euronext
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by or on behalf of Holdco, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Euronext Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

## Section 1.2. _Effect of the Offer on Euronext Stock Options_. Unless NYSE
Group and Euronext agree otherwise and subject to applicable Law, the Offer
shall not include any outstanding option to purchase Euronext Shares, but, in

or subscribed for as a result of the exercise of any such option prior to the
Expiration Time.

  

## Section 1.3. _Euronext Actions_.

efforts, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, to promptly furnish or
cause to be furnished to Holdco mailing labels, security position listings
and all available listings and computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record and beneficial holders of the Euronext Shares, in
each case as of the most recent practicable date, to facilitate the
transmission of the Offer, and to promptly furnish Holdco with such
additional information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists
of holders of Euronext Shares, updated periodically, and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Holdco or its agent(s) may
reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial holders of Euronext Shares, it being understood that the
majority of the Euronext Shares are registered in the name of Euroclear
France.

  

### (b) Euronext hereby approves of, and consents to, the Offer and the
Merger and represents and warrants that the Euronext Boards, at meetings duly
called and held, have (i) received an opinion from their financial advisors,
Morgan Stanley International and ABN AMRO, to the effect that the
consideration to be received by holders of Euronext Shares who tender their
Euronext Shares in the Offer is fair from a financial point of view to the
Euronext shareholders, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable and are fair to and in the best interests of Euronext, its
shareholders and employees and other stakeholders; (iii) approved and adopted

## Section 2.3. _Effective Time_.

  

### (a) As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable Law) of the condition set forth in Article VIII, on the Closing

Merger (such time that the Merger shall become effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  

## Section 2.4. _Effect of the Merger on Common Stock_.

  

### (a) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any capital stock of NYSE Group or Merger Sub, at the Effective
Time:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (i) each share of NYSE Group Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any share of NYSE Group
Common Stock owned by NYSE Group or Merger Sub and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (each, an " _Excluded Share_ ")) shall automatically
be converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share
of Holdco Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

  

#### (ii) each Excluded Share shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist; and

  

#### (iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub (each, a " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly
owned subsidiary of Holdco.

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, no NYSE Group Common Stock shall
remain outstanding and all NYSE Group Common Stock shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist. Each entry in the records of NYSE Group or
its transfer agent formerly representing shares of NYSE Group Common Stock
(the " _Book-Entry Interests_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any distribution or dividend pursuant
to Section 2.6(d).

  

### (c) With respect to any share of NYSE Group Common Stock whose transfer
was restricted as of immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of NYSE Group (each, a "
_Restricted Share_ "), each share of Holdco Common Stock issued in the Merger
in respect of such Restricted Share shall continue to be restricted, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time except that references to NYSE Group
shall be to Holdco. Such restrictions on transfer shall be set forth in the
New Holdco Charter.

  

### (d) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall
be available to holders of NYSE Group Common Stock in connection with the
Merger.

  

## Section 2.5. _Effect of the Merger on Options and Awards_.

  

## (a) Each option to purchase shares of NYSE Group Common Stock (a " _NYSE
Group Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of
NYSE Group (the " _NYSE Group Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of NYSE Group Common Stock and
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a Holdco Stock Option on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such NYSE Group Stock
Option. The number of shares of Holdco Common Stock

  



        
   

  



  

## subject to each such Holdco Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of NYSE Group Common Stock subject to each such NYSE Group Stock
Option and such Holdco Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share
equal to the per share exercise price specified in such NYSE Group Stock
Option.

  

## (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit or deferred stock
unit measured in shares of NYSE Group Common Stock (each, a " _NYSE Group
Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a restricted
stock unit or deferred stock unit with respect to shares of NYSE Group Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a Holdco Stock-
Based Award, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
NYSE Group Stock-Based Awards.  The number of shares of Holdco Common Stock
subject to each such Holdco Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of
shares of NYSE Group Common Stock subject to the NYSE Group Stock-Based
Award. All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a
NYSE Group Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited
to such holders account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.

  

## (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdco shall deliver
to the holders of NYSE Group Stock Options and NYSE Group Stock-Based Awards
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective NYSE Group Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of
such NYSE Group Stock Options and NYSE Group Stock-Based Awards and stating
that such NYSE Group Stock Options and NYSE Group Stock-Based Awards and
agreements have been assumed by Holdco and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.5 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the NYSE Group
Stock Plans).

  

## (d) Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Group shall take all necessary
action for the adjustment of NYSE Group Stock Options and NYSE Group Stock-
Based Awards under this Section 2.5. Holdco shall reserve for issuance a
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock at least equal to the number of
shares of Holdco Common Stock that will be subject to Holdco Stock Options
and Holdco Stock-Based Awards or the Equity Arrangements as a result of the
actions contemplated by this Section 2.5 and Section 3.2. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, Holdco shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not
available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Holdco
Common Stock subject to such Holdco Stock Options and Holdco Stock-Based
Awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Holdco Stock Options and
Holdco Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 2.6. _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, NYSE Group shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company, or a subsidiary thereof, to act
as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). On or prior to the
Effective Time, (i) Holdco shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of record of shares of NYSE Group
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shares of Holdco
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.4 in exchange for outstanding
shares of NYSE Group Common Stock upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of
instructions for use in effecting the transfer and cancellation of Book-Entry
Interests in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of Article II (such shares of Holdco Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### (b) _Merger Transmittal Letter_.  NYSE Group and Holdco shall cause
appropriate transmittal materials (the " _Merger Transmittal Letter_ "), to
be provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of record of shares of NYSE
Group Common Stock as soon as practicable after the Effective Time advising
such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for
providing instructions to the Exchange Agent to effect the transfer and
cancellation of Book-Entry Interests in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

  

### (c) After the Effective Time, and upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of
instructions authorizing transfer and cancellation of Book-Entry Interests in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Transmittal Letter, the holder of
such Book-Entry Interests shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
number of shares of Holdco Common Stock in respect of the aggregate Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.4
(after taking into account all shares of NYSE Group Common Stock then held by
such holder), and the Book-Entry Interests that are the subject of such
authorization shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon such transfer and cancellation of any
Book-Entry Interests. In the event of a transfer of ownership of NYSE Group
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of NYSE Group,
the proper number of shares of Holdco Common Stock may be issued to such a
transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of any Book-Entry
Interests are presented to the Exchange Agent, in any case, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any shares of
Holdco Common Stock to be issued in a name other than that in which any Book-
Entry Interests are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the issuance of shares of Holdco Common Stock in a name
other than that of the registered holder of any Book-Entry Interests, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of Holdco or the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
Self-Regulatory Organization or other entity of any kind or nature.

  



        
   

  



  

### " _Self-Regulatory Organization_ " means any U.S. or non-U.S.
commission, board, agency or body that is not a Governmental Entity but is
charged with the supervision or regulation of brokers, dealers, securities
underwriting or trading, stock exchanges, commodities exchanges, electronic
communication networks (ECNs), insurance companies or agents, investment
companies or investment advisers.

  

### (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. All shares
of Holdco Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Holdco in respect of Holdco Common Stock,
the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Holdco Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any Book-
Entry Interests until the instructions for transfer and cancellation
provided in this Article II have been delivered to the Exchange Agent.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following delivery to the Exchange
Agent of such instructions with respect to Book-Entry Interests, there shall
be issued to the holder of the shares of Holdco Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or
delivery of such instructions, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
Holdco Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

### (e) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of NYSE Group of NYSE Group Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (f) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock will
be issued in the Merger to any holder of shares of NYSE Group Common Stock.

  

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any Holdco Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of NYSE Group for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Holdco. Any former stockholders of NYSE Group who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Holdco for delivery of any shares of Holdco Common Stock of such
stockholders and payment of any dividends and other distributions in respect
of Holdco Common Stock of such stockholders payable and/or issuable pursuant
to this Article II upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of written
instructions for the transfer and cancellation of any Book-Entry Interests,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Holdco, NYSE Group, Merger Sub, any surviving entity in the Merger,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of NYSE Group Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



        
   

  



  

### (h) _Withholding Rights_.  Holdco shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or to cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any
consideration payable pursuant to the Merger to any Person who was a holder
of NYSE Group Common Stock, NYSE Group Stock Option or NYSE Group Stock-Based
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Holdco or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the NYSE Group Common Stock, NYSE Group Stock Option
or NYSE Group Stock-Based Award, as the case may be, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

  

## Section 2.7. _Restructuring of the Merger_. The parties hereto hereby
agree and acknowledge that, with the prior consent of Euronext (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), NYSE Group may restructure the Merger;
_provided_  that such restructuring shall not (i) reduce or change the form
of the Mixed Offer Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration or the
Cash Election Consideration, (ii) materially delay or prevent consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) prevent or
materially impede the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

# **ARTICLE III 
  
 POST-CLOSING REORGANIZATION**

  

## Section 3.1. _Post-Closing Reorganization_.

  

### (a) Holdco intends, simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the
Closing, to effectuate a corporate reorganization (the " _Post-Closing
Reorganization_ ") of Subsidiaries of Holdco (including Euronext and its
Subsidiaries).  The Post-Closing Reorganization may include any of the
following (each of the following, a " _Pre-Approved Post-Closing
Reorganization_ "), each of which has been, to the extent required, approved
by the Euronext Boards:

  

#### (i) if 95% or more of the outstanding Euronext Shares shall have been
acquired in the Offer, Holdco may commence a compulsory acquisition by Holdco
of Euronext Shares from any remaining minority shareholder in accordance with
Section 2:92a of the Dutch Civil Code and/or an acquisition by Holdco of
Euronext Shares from any remaining minority shareholder in accordance with
Articles 236-1 _et seq_. of the GRAMF;

  

#### (ii) if less than 95% of the outstanding Euronext Shares shall have been
acquired in the Offer:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (A) if the Euronext Shares have been acquired by Holdco, Holdco may
transfer the Euronext Shares immediately following the consummation of the
Offer to a newly formed, direct or indirect wholly owned Dutch Subsidiary of
Holdco (" _Dutch Holdco_ ") in exchange for shares of Dutch Holdco; and

  

#### (B) Euronext may, and Holdco may cause Euronext to, transfer all of its
assets and liabilities to a newly formed, wholly owned Dutch Subsidiary of
Euronext (" _Euronext Sub_ ") in exchange for shares of Euronext Sub or by
way of a legal demerger; and

  

#### (C) Euronext may, and Holdco may cause Euronext to, transfer the shares
in Euronext Sub to Dutch Holdco in exchange for shares of Holdco Common Stock
and cash and, then, cause Euronext to distribute such shares of Holdco Common
Stock and cash to its shareholders in a complete liquidation of Euronext. To
the extent that a liquidating distribution would be made to Dutch Holdco,
Dutch Holdco may substitute a note for the portion of the consideration
payable for the Euronext Sub shares that would be distributed to Dutch Holdco
in the liquidation of Euronext; or

  

#### (D) Euronext may, and Holdco may cause Euronext to, merge with and into
a newly formed, wholly owned Dutch Subsidiary of Dutch Holdco or Holdco ("
_Dutch Mergerco_ "), pursuant to which the Euronext shareholders will receive
shares in Dutch Mergerco; after such merger, Holdco may cause Dutch Mergerco
to transfer the shares in Euronext Sub to Dutch Holdco in exchange for shares
of Holdco Common Stock and cash and, then, cause Dutch Mergerco to distribute
such shares of Holdco Common Stock and cash to the Dutch Mergerco
shareholders in a complete liquidation of Dutch Mergerco. To the extent that
a liquidating distribution would be made to Dutch Holdco, Dutch Holdco may
substitute a note for the portion of the consideration payable for the
Euronext Sub shares that would be distributed to Dutch Holdco in the
liquidation of Dutch Mergerco;

  

 _provided_ that, if Holdco desires to take the actions specified in clause
(D) above instead of clause (C) above, Holdco shall have received the written
consent of Euronext prior to taking such actions (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld unless the Euronext Boards, after consultation with
outside counsel, determine in good faith that such consent would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; it being understood
that, in making this determination, the Euronext Boards shall consider the
interests of all shareholders of Euronext to the extent that it considers the
interests of any shareholder or group of shareholders of Euronext); 
_provided_ , _further_ that, in each case, the Post-Closing Reorganization
shall be structured to provide holders of Euronext Shares who do not exchange
such Euronext Shares in the Offer with the same number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock and the same amount of cash (without taking into account the
different tax treatment or withholding requirements that may apply) that such
holders would have

  



        
   

  



  

received in the Offer had such holder tendered its Euronext Shares in the
Offer (and not made the Stock Election or the Cash Election).

  

### (b) Holdco shall have the right to change the structure of the Post-
Closing Reorganization, which changed structure may include, without
limitation, (i) the amendment of the Articles of Association of Euronext to
permit the creation, among other things, of separate classes of shares, (ii)
the distribution of an extraordinary dividend on the shares of Euronext or a
particular class or classes of shares of Euronext, (iii) the sale and
transfer by Euronext, or any of its Subsidiaries, to Holdco or any affiliate
or Subsidiary of Holdco, of all or a portion of the assets of Euronext or its
Subsidiaries, (iv) the effectuation by Euronext and one or more Dutch
Subsidiaries of Holdco of a legal merger within the meaning of Section 2:309
of the Dutch Civil Code, (v) the request for termination of the listing of
the Euronext Shares on Euronext Paris, (vi) a liquidation of Euronext, (vii)
the contribution of assets to Euronext in exchange for Euronext Shares (with
the exclusion of preemptive rights, if any, of other shareholders, all in
accordance with applicable Law) or (viii) any one or more combinations of any
of the foregoing actions, all of which shall be conducted in accordance with
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco shall not change the
structure of the Post-Closing Reorganization without the prior written
consent of Euronext (which consent shall not be withheld unless the Euronext
Boards, after consultation with their outside legal counsel, determine in
good faith that such consent would result in a breach of its directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; it being understood that, in making
this determination, the Euronext Boards shall consider the interests of all
shareholders of Euronext to the extent that it considers the interests of any
shareholder or group of shareholders of Euronext) and shall have the right to
propose alternatives for the Post-Closing Reorganization, which Holdco and
NYSE Group shall consider in good faith. Holdco, NYSE Group and Euronext
shall cooperate with each other in identifying and obtaining any Dutch tax
clearances necessary or desirable in connection with the Post-Closing
Reorganization.

  

### (c) Subject to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), the Post-Closing
Reorganization shall be structured so that, in the opinion of counsel to NYSE
Group, the Post-Closing Reorganization, together with the Offer, constitutes
either a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of Section 338 of the
Code or a taxable asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
unless, at the election of NYSE Group, it is desirable to allow the Holdco
Common Stock issued in the Offer and Post-Closing Reorganization to be
received tax free by U.S. holders of Euronext Shares, in which case the Post-
Closing Reorganization shall be structured so that, in the opinion of counsel
to NYSE Group, the Post-Closing Reorganization, together with the Offer,
constitutes either a reorganization (within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code) or part of a transfer of Euronext Shares described in Section 351 of
the Code.

  

## Section 3.2. _Effect of Post-Closing Reorganization on Euronext Stock
Options and Euronext Stock-Based Awards_ _._

  

### (a) _Conversion._ Except as provided in Section 3.2(b), at the Effective
Time or to the extent not feasible at such date for some or all holders in
some or all

  



        
   

  



  

### jurisdictions (for Tax reasons or otherwise), promptly thereafter and in
any event no later than the completion of the Post-Closing Reorganization,
each option to purchase Euronext Shares (a " _Euronext Stock Option_ ") and
each restricted share, restricted stock unit or deferred stocks unit measured
in Euronext Shares (each, a " _Euronext Stock-Based Award_ ") granted under
the employee and director stock option and stock-based award plans of
Euronext (the " _Euronext Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall
cease to represent a Euronext Stock Option or Euronext Stock-Based
Award, respectively, and shall be converted into a stock option to acquire
Holdco Common Stock (a " _Holdco Stock Option_ ") or a restricted
share, restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit measured in Holdco Common
Stock (a " _Holdco Stock-Based Award_ "), respectively, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Euronext Stock Option and
Euronext Stock-Based Award prior to the Post-Closing Reorganization (or such
other arrangement that the parties shall mutually agree prior to the filing
of the Offer with the AMF); _provided_ that the number of shares of Holdco
Common Stock subject to each such Holdco Stock Option or Holdco Stock-Based
Award shall be the number of Roussseau Shares subject to each such Euronext
Stock Option or Euronext Stock-Based Award multiplied by the Stock Election
Amount (assuming no pro-ration or adjustment as provided in Section 1.1(d)),
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Holdco Common Stock, and
such Holdco Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to
the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in such Euronext Stock Option divided by the Stock Election
Amount (assuming no pro-ration or adjustment as provided in Section 1.1(d)).

  

### (b) _Specific Arrangement for Certain Holders._ If it is reasonably
foreseeable that the conversion of any of the Euronext Stock Options and/or
Euronext Stock-Based Awards referred to in Section 3.2(a) would cause holders
of Euronext Stock Options and/or Euronext Stock-Based Awards who are French
residents for Tax purposes (the " _French Holders_ ") to incur additional
Taxes or social security charges under French law (the " _French Taxes_ "),
as compared to the French Taxes that such French Holders would incur pursuant
to the first sentence of Article 200 A 6 of the French General Tax Code with
respect to Euronext Stock Options if such French Holders had converted the
Euronext Stock Options after holding such Euronext Stock Options for four
years from the date of grant of the original Euronext Stock Option or as
compared to the French Taxes that such French Holders would incur pursuant to
Article 200 A 6 _bis_  of the French General Tax Code with respect to
Euronext Stock-Based Awards if such French Holder had converted the Euronext
Stock-Based Awards into Euronext Shares after holding such Euronext Stock-
Based Awards for applicable vesting period and after holding the Euronext
Common Stock resulting from such vesting for two years (the " _Favorable Tax
Amount_ " for such Euronext Stock Option or Euronext Stock-Based Award, as
applicable), Holdco will offer to the French Holders of the Euronext Stock-
Options and Euronext Stock-Based Awards, whether vested or unvested, the
right to participate in certain equity arrangements entered into between
Holdco and the relevant French Holders (the " _Equity Arrangements_ "),
pursuant to which Holdco shall undertake vis-a-vis each such French Holder,
and each such French Holder shall undertake vis-a-vis Holdco, to exchange
each Euronext Share purchased, subscribed or received pursuant to the
Euronext Stock Options or Euronext Stock-Based Awards after the completion of
the Offer for a number of shares

  



        
   

  



  

### of Holdco Common Stock equal to the Stock Election Amount (assuming no
pro-ration or adjustment as provided in Section 1.1(d)); _provided_ that
nothing in this Section 3.2(b) shall limit or prohibit Holdco from
undertaking the Post-Closing Reorganization in the time or manner that Holdco
shall determine, subject to the requirements of Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b).
In the event that Holdco shall undertake a Post-Closing Reorganization that
(1) shall result in the termination of the Equity Arrangements, (2) shall
prevent Euronext from issuing Euronext Shares upon exercise of the Euronext
Stock Options or Euronext Stock-Based Awards or (3) shall cause the French
Holders to incur French Taxes in an amount greater than the Favorable Tax
Amount in respect of such Euronext Stock Options or Euronext Stock-Based
Awards, then the outstanding Euronext Stock Options and Euronext Stock-Based
Awards held by the French Holders shall be converted into Holdco Stock
Options and Holdco Stock-Based Awards as provided in Section 3.2(a), and
Holdco shall pay to each such French Holder (or pay to the applicable Tax
authority if required by applicable Law) an amount of cash (the " _Gross-Up
Payment_ ") equal to the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of
French Taxes imposed on such French Holder that arises as a result of the
Post-Closing Reorganization, if any, _minus_ (ii) the aggregate Favorable Tax
Amount that such French Holders would have incurred with respect to such
Euronext Stock Options and/or Euronext Stock-Based Awards after holding such
Euronext Stock Options and/or Euronext Stock-Based Awards (or the resulting
shares) for the period from the date of grant necessary to qualify for
taxation based on the Favorable Tax Amount. In addition, Holdco shall pay
to each such French Holder (or pay to the applicable Tax authority if
required by applicable Law) an amount of cash equal to the aggregate French
Taxes incurred by such French Holder as a result of the Gross-Up Payment and
the payments pursuant to this sentence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in no event shall Holdco be required to make any
Gross-Up Payment or any other payment pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) in
respect of (A) Euronext Stock Options originally granted under Euronexts SBF
Option Plan or Euronexts 2002 Option Plan or any other Euronext
Stock Options that were granted on a date that is four or more years prior to
the date on which a conversion of such options occurs in accordance with
Section 3.2(a) (including Holdco Stock Options upon any such conversion) or
(B) a Euronext Stock-Based Award granted on a date that is granted prior to
2005, if any.

  

### (c) _Tax-Free Rollover_. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.2(b),
NYSE Group, Holdco and Euronext shall cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to cause, where possible, the conversion of all Euronext Stock
Options and Euronext Stock-Based Awards into Holdco Stock Options or Holdco
Stock-Based Awards (as applicable) as set forth in Section 3.2(a) not to be a
taxable transaction for the holders of these Euronext Stock Options or
Euronext Stock-Based Awards; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 3.2(c)
shall (A) limit or prohibit Holdco from undertaking the Post-Closing
Reorganization in the time or manner that Holdco shall determine, subject to
the requirements of Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), or (B) subject to Section
3.2(b), require Holdco to compensate any holder of a Euronext Stock Option or
Euronext Stock-Based Award for any Taxes or social security charges
incurred or borne by such holder. Any adjustment to Euronext Stock Options
or Stock-Based Awards shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code, to the extent applicable.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 3.3. _Cooperation of Euronext_. Euronext shall take, on or after
the date of this Agreement, all actions reasonably necessary or desirable to
accomplish the Post-Closing Reorganization (provided that the Post-Closing
Reorganization shall not be required to be effective prior to the
consummation of the Offer), including, without limitation: (i) the convening
of the necessary meetings of Euronext shareholders and the Euronext Boards,
(ii) the consideration of any and all necessary or desirable resolutions by
the Euronext Boards for the purpose of the Post-Closing Reorganization, and
(iii) the execution of any and all reasonably requested documents, agreements
or deeds that are necessary or desirable to effectuate any of the corporate
reorganizations and the filing or registration of any or all of such
documents, agreements or deeds with the appropriate authorities or agencies.
At the request of Holdco, Euronext shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or contrary to the
requirements of any European Regulator, (i) convert any Subsidiary of
Euronext from an entity that is classified as a corporation pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-2(b)(8) into an entity that is an
"eligible entity" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-3(a)), (ii) make entity classification elections pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 for any Subsidiary of Euronext in such
manner and with such effective dates as specified by Holdco, and (iii)
subject to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), take any and all other reasonable
actions that are required or desirable to accomplish the Post-Closing
Reorganization.

Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the
results of operations, retained earnings, stockholders equity, cash flows

Euronext (A) has designed reasonable disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that material information relating to Euronext, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of Euronext by
others within those

  



        
   

  



  

#### entities, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to Euronexts auditors and the audit committee of
the Euronext Boards (x) any significant deficiencies known to Euronexts
management or internal auditors (in-sourced or outsourced) in the design or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material
respect Euronexts ability to record, process, summarize and report financial

### (g) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in Euronext
Reports, since the December 31, 2005, Euronext and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any

of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change or development that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably expected to have,
a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext; (ii) any material damage, destruction
or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned,
leased or otherwise used by Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or

IFRS. Since December 31, 2005, except as provided for herein or as disclosed
in Euronext Reports, there has not been any increase in the compensation
payable or that could become payable by Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries
to officers or key employees or any amendment of or other modification to any
of the Euronext Benefit Plans other than increases or amendments in the
ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice.

  

### (h) _Compliance_. Neither Euronext nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law of any Governmental
Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization or (ii) any Contract to which Euronext
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Euronext or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties is bound or
affected, except in each of cases (i) and (ii), for any such
conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Euronext. Except as expressly set forth in the Euronext Reports, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity or any Self-Regulatory
Organization with respect to Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries is pending
or, to the knowledge of Euronext, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
or any Self-Regulatory Organization indicated an intention to conduct the
same, except, in each case, for those the outcome of which, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Euronext. Except as set forth in the Euronext
Reports or as, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext, (x) no material change is
required in Euronexts or any of its Subsidiaries processes, properties or
procedures to comply with any Laws in effect on the date hereof or enacted as
of the date hereof and scheduled to be effective after the date hereof, and
(y) Euronext has not received any written notice or

  



        
   

  



  

### written communication of any noncompliance with any Law. Each of Euronext
and its Subsidiaries has all Permits of all Governmental Entities and Self-
Regulatory Organizations necessary to conduct its business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Euronext.

  

### (i) _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Euronext
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are no (i) civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations
or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Euronext, threatened against
Euronext, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers, or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be disclosed,
including those relating to, or any other facts or circumstances of which, to
the knowledge of Euronext, could result in any claims against, or obligations
or liabilities of, Euronext or any of its affiliates, except, in both cases,
for those that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext.

appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

  

#### (iii) As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Euronext, threatened, litigation relating to the Euronext Benefit Plans that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably expected to have,
a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext. Other than as required by applicable
Law, neither Euronext nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
obligations for retiree welfare benefits to current or former employees of
Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries. Other than as prohibited by applicable
Law, Euronext or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any
time without incurring

  



        
   

  



  

#### any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior
to such amendment or termination.

  

#### (iv) There has been no amendment to, announcement by Euronext or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Euronext Benefit Plan which would increase the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for

Euronext Employees to additional compensation or to severance pay or
any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the

which have not been resolved and fully paid or accrued as a liability on the

neither Euronext nor any of its Subsidiaries have waived any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency; (F) all Taxes due and payable by

party to or otherwise bound by any material collective bargaining agreement,
Contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization, nor is Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any
material proceeding asserting that Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries has

any labor union or labor organization nor is there pending or, to the
knowledge of Euronext, threatened, nor has there been for the past
five years, any material Strike involving Euronext or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for any general Strikes that are not directed

### (m) _Insurance_. All insurance policies maintained by Euronext and its

conducting the business conducted by Euronext and its Subsidiaries during
such time period, are in character and amount at least equivalent to that
carried by Persons engaged in similar businesses and subject to the same or
similar perils or hazards, and are sufficient for compliance with all Laws
currently applicable to Euronext and its Subsidiaries. None of Euronext or
any of its Subsidiaries has received since January 1, 2006 any notice

Material Adverse Effect on Euronext: (A) the Euronext Intellectual Property
owned by Euronext is valid, subsisting and enforceable, (B) Euronexts and/or
its Subsidiaries ownership of and right to use the Euronext Intellectual
Property is free and clear of any lien, pledge, security interest or other
encumbrance and (C) no other Person has the right to use any of the owned
Euronext Intellectual Property, except pursuant to non-exclusive

use any Euronext Intellectual Property (the " _Euronext Intellectual Property
Contracts_ ") are legal, valid, binding and enforceable against the other
party, and are in full force and effect, subject to Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions. Except as has not had or is not reasonably expected to have a

or is not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext,

there is no unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation and other
violation of Euronext Intellectual Property by any Person, including any
Employee of Euronext or any of its Subsidiaries, except as would not
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext. Euronext
and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of the trade secrets and other non-public information owned
by Euronext or its Subsidiaries, or received from third Persons which
Euronext or its Subsidiaries is obligated to treat as confidential, except
for such steps the failure of which to have taken has not, individually or in
the aggregate, had or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Euronext.

  

#### (iii) To the knowledge of Euronext and except as has not had or is not
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Euronext, the IT
Assets of Euronext operate and perform in all material respects in accordance
with their documentation and functional specifications, to the extent
available, or as otherwise required by Euronext and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the business of Euronext as currently conducted. Each of
Euronext and its Subsidiaries has implemented reasonable backup and disaster
recovery measures consistent with industry standards.

legal counsel and financial advisors) that there is a reasonable likelihood
that such Acquisition Proposal could constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) in
the case of clause (B) or (C) above, its Board, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary
in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (iv) in the case of clause (C) above, prior to
providing any information or data to any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, its Board receives from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less restrictive, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (v) in
the case of clause (C) above, NYSE Group or Euronext, as the case may be, is
not then in material breach of its obligations under this Section 7.2. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(c), references to " _Board_ " means, in relation
to NYSE Group, the Board of Directors of NYSE Group and, in relation to
Euronext, the Euronext Boards.

  

### (d) Prior to any Change in NYSE Group Recommendation, NYSE Group shall
provide Euronext written notice (the " _NYSE Group Superior Proposal Notice_
") of NYSE Groups intention to make a Change in NYSE Group Recommendation at
least four business days prior to making a Change in NYSE Group
Recommendation, and shall consider any modifications to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by Euronext
after its receipt of the NYSE Group Superior Proposal Notice (with respect to
which modifications NYSE Group and Euronext shall negotiate in good faith
during such four-business day period), in determining whether an Acquisition
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal for NYSE Group after such
four-business day period.  Prior to any Change in Euronext Recommendation,
Euronext shall provide NYSE Group written notice (the " _Euronext Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") of Euronexts intention to make a Change in Euronext
Recommendation at least four business days prior to making a Change in
Euronext Recommendation, and shall consider any modifications to the terms of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by NYSE
Group after its receipt of the Euronext Superior Proposal Notice (with
respect to which modifications NYSE Group and Euronext shall negotiate in
good faith during such four-business day period), in determining whether an
Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal for Euronext after
such four-business day period.

  



        
   

  



  

### (e) In the event that a third party who has previously made an
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of NYSE Group or the
Euronext Boards, as the case may be, has or have determined in accordance
with this Section 7.2 is a Superior Proposal subsequently modifies or amends
in an adverse manner any material term of such Superior Proposal, then such
Boards prior determination shall be null and void and such Board shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(c) and (d) in all respects
(including the obligation to deliver a new NYSE Group Superior Proposal
Notice or Euronext Superior Proposal Notice, as applicable, and negotiate in
good faith with Euronext or NYSE Group, as applicable).

  

### (f) Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by
shareholder action, each of NYSE Group and Euronext agrees that it will, and
will cause its senior officers, directors and representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of NYSE Group and
Euronext agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its directors, officers, agents and representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 7.2. Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall (x) permit
Euronext or NYSE Group to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically
provided in Article IX hereof) or (y) affect any other obligation of Euronext
or NYSE Group under this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement. Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or
by shareholder action, neither Euronext nor NYSE Group shall submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Offer or the
Merger, respectively.

  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means, with respect to NYSE Group or Euronext, a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal obtained not in breach of this Section
7.2 for or in respect of 50% or more of the outstanding NYSE Group Common
Stock or Euronext Shares (as applicable) or 50% or more of the assets of NYSE
Group and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or Euronext and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (as applicable), in each of case on
terms that the Board of Directors of NYSE Group or the Euronext Boards (as
applicable) in good faith concludes (following receipt of the advice of its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among
other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of
the Acquisition Proposal or offer and this Agreement, and taking into account
any improved terms that Euronext (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal for
NYSE Group) or NYSE Group (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal for
Euronext) have offered pursuant to this Section 7.2 deemed relevant by such
Board or Boards (including conditions to and expected timing and risks of
consummation and the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain
financing for such Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable from a financial
point of view to the stockholders and other stakeholders of Euronext or to
the stockholders of NYSE Group, as applicable, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any such improved
terms).

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 7.3. _Stockholders Meetings_.

  

### (a) NYSE Group will take, in accordance with applicable Law and the NYSE

Meeting Date_ "), which date shall be as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective;  _provided_ that, after
consultation with Euronext, NYSE Group may convene the NYSE Group
Stockholders Meeting after the SEC shall have granted any necessary approvals
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any approvals of any application under Rule 19b-4 of the Exchange
Act submitted in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Board
of Directors of NYSE Group shall recommend such adoption or approval, as the

approval.  In the event that subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the
NYSE Group Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof), the
Board of Directors of NYSE Group determines that this Agreement is no longer
advisable and either makes no recommendation or recommends that its
stockholders reject this Agreement (a " _Change in NYSE Group Recommendation_
"), which Change in NYSE Group Recommendation shall be made only in
accordance with Section 7.2(c), Euronext shall have a right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Article IX.

  

### (b) Euronext will take, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Euronext Organizational Documents, all action necessary to convene an
extraordinary general meeting of its stockholders (the " _Euronext
Stockholders Meeting_ ") on a date determined by Euronext after consultation

as promptly as practicable after the information circular (the "
_Euronext Shareholder Circular_ ") for the Euronext Stockholders Meeting
shall be completed, to approve the Offer and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Such approval shall require a simple majority of the votes
validly cast at such meeting (the " _Euronext Requisite Vote_ "). Subject to
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Euronext Boards shall
recommend such approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval and shall recommend the Offer to its shareholders and recommend that
they tender their Euronext Shares into the Offer. In the event that
subsequent to the date hereof, the Euronext Boards determine that this
Agreement is no longer advisable and either makes no recommendation or
recommends that its shareholders not tender their Euronext Shares into the
Offer (a " _Change in Euronext Recommendation_ "), which Change in
Euronext Recommendation shall be made only in accordance with Section 7.2(b),
NYSE Group shall have a right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with

Agreement in accordance with Section 9.5. Nothing in this Section 7.4
shall require, or be construed to require, NYSE Group or Euronext to (A)
proffer to, or agree to, sell or hold separate and agree to sell, or take any
other action with respect to, before or after the Effective Time, any

current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by NYSE Group (provided that Holdco

claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Holdco be required to
expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
(such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Euronext Insurance Amount_ ") currently
paid by Euronext for such insurance (which annual premiums are set forth in
Section 7.11(b) of the Euronext Disclosure Letter); and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Holdco shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest

less advantageous to the insured than the current directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Euronext;

PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

  

### (b) The parties hereby (i) irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_
") and the Federal Courts of the United States of America located in the
State of Delaware (the " _Federal Courts_ ") in respect of any
claim, dispute or controversy relating to or arising out of the negotiation,
interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any of the documents
referred to in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (any such claim being a " _Covered Claim_ "); (ii) irrevocably agree
to request that the Delaware or Federal Courts adjudicate any Covered Claim
on an expedited basis and to cooperate with each other to assure that an
expedited resolution of any such dispute is achieved; (iii) waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding raising a
Covered Claim that any of the parties hereto is not subject to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware or Federal Courts or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said Courts or that
the venue thereof may be inappropriate or inconvenient or that this Agreement
or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Courts; and (iv)
irrevocably agree to abide by the rules of procedure applied by the Delaware
or Federal Court (as the case the may be) (including but not limited to

enforce the judgments and orders of the Delaware or Federal Courts.

requiring specific performance) rendered by a Delaware or Federal Court in
respect of a Covered Claim.

2602, New York, New York 10006, as its designee, appointee and agent to
receive, for and on its behalf service of process in such jurisdiction in any
legal action or proceedings with respect to this Agreement or any
other agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, and such service
shall be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to the Process Agent;
_provided_  that, in the case of any such service upon the Process Agent, the
party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to Euronext.
Euronext shall take all such action as may be necessary to continue said
appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so that
Euronext will at all times have an agent for service of process for the above
purposes in New York, New York. In the event of the transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets and business of the Process Agent to any
other person or entity by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise,
such other person or entity shall be substituted hereunder for the Process
Agent with the same effect as if named herein in place of such Process Agent.
Euronext further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of
the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of
copies thereof by registered airmail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective

percent (50%) of the assets of such owner and its

IV shall be referred to as the " _Lock-Up_." If any NYSE Group Share shall
be represented by a certificate, a legend shall be placed on such certificate
to the effect that such NYSE Group Share is subject to the Lock-Up, which
legend shall be removed from a certificate upon the occurrence of the Lock-Up
Expiration Date with respect to all of the NYSE Group Shares represented by
such certificate.  Such legend shall also be placed on any certificate
representing securities issued subsequent to the original issuance of NYSE
Group Shares in the Merger and in respect thereof as a result of any stock
dividend, stock split or other recapitalization, to the extent that such
securities shall be represented by certificates. Such legends will
be removed from the certificates representing such shares of Common Stock and
any other securities when, and to the extent that, such Transfer restrictions
set forth herein are no longer applicable to any of the shares represented by
such certificates. If any

  



        
   

  



  

### NYSE Group Shares or securities issued in respect thereof shall not be
represented by certificates, then the Company reserves the right to require
that an analogous notification or restriction be used in respect of such NYSE
Group Shares or securities that are subject to the Lock-Up. Upon the Release
of any Transfer restriction from any of the NYSE Group Shares or any
securities issued in a subsequent issuance in respect thereof as a result of
any stock dividend, stock split or other recapitalization, if the Board shall
have designated prior to such Release a particular broker or brokers and/or
the particular manner of the Transfer of such shares to be Released, such
shares shall be Transferred only through such broker and in such manner as
designated by the Board. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the
foregoing, the Board may require, as a condition to the Release, that all
such Released NYSE Group Shares be sold through an underwritten offering
registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (and
that any sale will apply (i) first, to such owners Year 1 NYSE Group Shares,
(ii) second, to such owners Year 2 NYSE Group Shares and (iii) third, to
such owners Year 3 NYSE Group Shares), and that if an owner does not
Transfer such owners NYSE Group Shares pursuant to such registered offering,
then such holders NYSE Group Shares shall not be Released prior to the
scheduled Lock-Up Expiration Date, unless the Board shall Release such NYSE
Group Shares on a later occasion. Unless otherwise determined by the Board,
all fees and commissions payable to any broker or underwriter in connection
with such Transfer shall be borne by the owners of Common Stock participating
in such Transfer, _pro rata_ based on the relative number of shares of Common
Stock of such holder in such Transfer.

  

### (E) The Corporation shall not register the purported Transfer of any
shares of stock of the Corporation in violation of the restrictions imposed
by this Section 4 of Article IV.

## Section 1. _Voting Limitation_.

  

### (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, (1) no Person, either alone or together with its Related
Persons (as defined below), as of any record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to vote on any matter, shall be entitled to vote or
cause the voting of shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by
such Person or its Related Persons, in person or by proxy or through any
voting agreement or other arrangement, to the extent that such shares
represent in the aggregate more than 10% of the then outstanding votes
entitled to be cast on such matter, without giving effect to this Article V
(such threshold being hereinafter referred to as the " _Voting Limitation_
"), and the Corporation shall disregard any such votes purported to be cast
in excess of the Voting Limitation; and (2) if any Person, either alone
or together with its Related Persons, is party to any agreement, plan or
other arrangement relating to shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote on any matter with any other Person, either alone or together with its
Related Persons, under circumstances that would result in shares of stock of
the Corporation that would be subject to such agreement, plan or other
arrangement not being voted on any matter, or the withholding of any proxy
relating

  



        
   

  



  

### thereto, where the effect of such agreement, plan or other arrangement
would be to enable any Person, but for this Article V, either alone or
together with its Related Persons, to vote, possess the right to vote or
cause the voting of shares of stock of the Corporation that would exceed 10%
of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on such matter (assuming
that all shares of stock of the Corporation that are subject to such
agreement, plan or other arrangement are not outstanding votes entitled to be
cast on such matter) (the " _Recalculated Voting Limitation_ "), then the
Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, shall not be
entitled to vote or cause the voting of shares of stock of the Corporation
beneficially owned by such Person, either alone or together with its Related
Persons, in person or by proxy or through any voting agreement or other
arrangement, to the extent that such shares represent in the aggregate more
than the Recalculated Voting Limitation, and the Corporation shall disregard
any such votes purported to be cast in excess of the Recalculated Voting
Limitation.

  

The Voting Limitation and the Recalculated Voting Limitation, as applicable,
shall apply to each Person unless and until: (i) such Person shall have
delivered to the Board a notice in writing, not less than 45 days (or such

excess of the Voting Limitation or the Recalculated Voting Limitation, as
applicable; (ii) the Board shall have resolved to expressly permit such
voting; (iii) such resolution shall have been filed with, and approved by,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under Section 19(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and
shall have become effective thereunder; and (iv) such resolution shall have
been filed with, and approved by, each European Regulator having appropriate
jurisdiction and authority. Subject to its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, the Board shall not adopt any resolution pursuant to
clause (ii) of this Section 1(A) of Article V unless the Board shall have
determined that:

  

(w) the exercise of such voting rights or the entering into of such
agreement, plan or other arrangement, as applicable, by such Person, either
alone or together with its Related Persons, will not impair the ability of
either the Corporation or any of the New York Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE
Market, Inc., NYSE Regulation, Inc., Archipelago Exchange, L.L.C., the
Pacific Exchange, Inc. or PCX Equities, Inc. (each, a " _Regulated
Subsidiary_ " and together, the " _Regulated Subsidiaries_ ") to discharge
their respective responsibilities under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and is otherwise in the best interests of the
Corporation, its stockholders and the Regulated Subsidiaries;

  

(x) the exercise of such voting rights or the entering into of such
agreement, plan or other arrangement, as applicable, by such Person, either
alone or together with its Related Persons, will not impair the SECs ability
to enforce the Exchange Act or the ability of the European Regulators to
enforce the European Exchange Regulations;

  



        
   

  



  

(y) in the case of a resolution to approve the exercise of voting rights in
excess of 20% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on such
matter, (1) neither such Person nor any of its Related Persons is subject to
any statutory disqualification (as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the
Exchange Act); (2) for so long as the Corporation directly or indirectly
controls the Pacific Exchange, Inc. (" _PCX_ ") or PCX Equities, Inc. (" _PCX
Equities_ ") or any facility of PCX, neither such Person nor any of its
Related Persons is an ETP Holder (as defined in the PCX Equities rules of
PCX, as such rules may be in effect from time to time) of PCX Equities (any
such Person that is a Related Person of an ETP Holder shall hereinafter also
be deemed to be an " _ETP Holder_ " for purposes of this Certificate of
Incorporation, as the context may require) or an OTP Holder or OTP Firm (each
as defined in the rules of PCX, as such rules may be in effect from time to
time) of PCX (any such Person that is a Related Person of an OTP Holder or
OTP Firm shall hereinafter also be deemed to be an " _OTP Holder_ " or " _OTP
Firm_ ", as appropriate, for purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation,
as the context may require); and (3) for so long as the Corporation directly
or indirectly controls New York Stock Exchange LLC or NYSE Market, Inc.,
neither such Person nor any of its Related Persons is a "member" or "member
organization" (as defined in the rules of New York Stock Exchange LLC, as
such rules may be in effect from time to time) (any such Person that is a
Related Person of such member or member organization shall hereinafter also
be deemed to be a " _Member_ " for purposes of this Certificate of
Incorporation, as the context may require); and

  

(z) in the case of a resolution to approve the entering into of an agreement,
plan or other arrangement under circumstances that would result in shares of
stock of the Corporation that would be subject to such agreement, plan or
other arrangement not being voted on any matter, or the withholding of any
proxy relating thereto, where the effect of such agreement, plan or other
arrangement would be to enable any Person, but for this Article V, either
alone or together with its Related Persons, to vote, possess the right to
vote or cause the voting of shares of stock of the Corporation that would
exceed 20% of the then outstanding votes entitled to be cast on such matter
(assuming that all shares of stock of the Corporation that are subject to
such agreement, plan or other arrangement are not outstanding votes entitled
to be cast on such matter), (1) neither such Person nor any of its Related
Persons is subject to any statutory disqualification (as defined in Section
3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act); (2) for so long as the Corporation directly or
indirectly controls the Pacific Exchange, Inc. or PCX Equities, Inc. or any
facility of PCX, neither such Person nor any of its Related Persons is an ETP
Holder, OTP Holder or an OTP Firm; and (3) for so long as the Corporation
directly or indirectly controls New York Stock Exchange LLC or NYSE Market,
Inc., neither such Person nor any of its Related Persons is a Member.

  

### (B) In making such determinations, the Board may impose such conditions
and restrictions on such Person and its Related Persons owning any shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter as the Board may in
its sole

  



        
   

  



  

### discretion deem necessary, appropriate or desirable in furtherance of the
objectives of the Exchange Act, the European Exchange Regulations and the
governance of the Corporation.

  

### (C) If and to the extent that shares of stock of the Corporation
beneficially owned by any Person or its Related Persons are held of record by
any other Person (the " _Record Owner_ "), this Section 1 of Article V shall
be enforced against such Record Owner by limiting the votes entitled to be
cast by such Record Owner in a manner that will accomplish the Voting
Limitation and the Recalculated Voting Limitation applicable to such Person
and its Related Persons.

  

### (D) This Section 1 of Article V shall not apply to (x) any solicitation
of any revocable proxy from any stockholder of the Corporation by or on
behalf of the Corporation or by any officer or director of the Corporation
acting on behalf of the Corporation or (y) any solicitation of any revocable
proxy from any stockholder of the Corporation by any other stockholder that

14a-2(b)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act, with respect to which Section
1 of Article V shall apply).

  

### (E) For purposes of this Section 1 of Article V, no Person shall be
deemed to have any agreement, arrangement or understanding to act together
with respect to voting shares of stock of the Corporation solely because such
Person or any of such Persons Related Persons has or shares the power to
vote or direct the voting of such shares of stock as a result of (x) any
solicitation of any revocable proxy from any stockholder of the Corporation
by or on behalf of the Corporation or by any officer or director of the

### (A) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2 of Article V, no
Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, shall be permitted
at any time to own beneficially shares of stock of the Corporation
representing in the aggregate more than 20% of the then outstanding votes

### (B) The Concentration Limitation shall apply to each Person unless and
until: (i) such Person shall have delivered to the Board a notice in writing,
not less than 45 days (or such shorter period as the Board shall expressly
consent to) prior to the acquisition of any shares that would cause such

ownership; (iii) such resolution shall have been filed with, and approved

### (C) Subject to its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, the Board

this Article V unless the Board shall have determined that:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (1) such acquisition of beneficial ownership by such Person, either
alone or together with its Related Persons, will not impair the ability of
any of the Regulated Subsidiaries to discharge its responsibilities under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and is otherwise in the
best interests of the Corporation, its stockholders and the Regulated
Subsidiaries;

  

#### (2) such acquisition of beneficial ownership by such Person, either
alone or together with its Related Persons, will not impair the SECs ability
to enforce the Exchange Act or the ability of the European Regulators to
enforce the European Exchange Regulations. In making such determinations, the
Board may impose such conditions and restrictions on such Person and its

met, if any Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, at any
time beneficially owns shares of stock of the Corporation in excess of
the Concentration Limitation, such Person and its Related Persons shall
be obligated to sell promptly, and the Corporation shall be obligated to
purchase promptly, at a price equal to the par value of such shares of stock
and to the extent funds are legally available therefor, that number of shares
of stock of the Corporation necessary so that such Person, together with its
Related Persons, shall beneficially own shares of stock of the
Corporation representing in the aggregate no more than 20% of the then
outstanding votes entitled to be cast on any matter, after taking into
account that such repurchased shares shall become treasury shares and shall
no longer be deemed to be outstanding.

  

### (E) Nothing in this Section 2 of Article V shall preclude the settlement
of transactions entered into through the facilities of New York Stock
Exchange LLC; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if any Transfer of any shares
of stock of the Corporation shall cause any Person, either alone or together
with its Related Persons, at any time to beneficially own shares of stock of
the Corporation in excess of the Concentration Limitation, such Person and
its Related Persons shall be obligated to sell promptly, and the Corporation
shall be obligated to purchase promptly, shares of stock of the Corporation

notice of such restrictions and limitations shall be included in the
statement of ownership provided to the holder of record of such shares of
Common Stock.

  

## Section 3. _Procedure for Repurchasing Stock_.

  

### (A) In the event the Corporation shall repurchase shares of stock (the "
_Repurchased Stock_ ") of the Corporation pursuant to any provision of
Article IV or this Article V, notice of such repurchase shall be given by
first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 5 business nor more
than 60 calendar days prior to the repurchase date, to the holder of the
Repurchased Stock, at such holders address as the same appears on the stock
register of the Corporation. Each such notice shall state: (1) the repurchase
date; (2) the number of shares of Repurchased Stock to be repurchased; (3)
the aggregate repurchase price, which shall equal the aggregate par value of
such shares; and (4) the place or places where such Repurchased Stock is to
be surrendered for payment of the aggregate repurchase price.  Failure to
give notice as aforesaid, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
validity of the repurchase of Repurchased Stock. From and after the repurchase
date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in providing funds for
the payment of the repurchase price), shares of Repurchased Stock which have
been repurchased as aforesaid shall become treasury shares and shall no
longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the holder of such
Repurchased Stock as a stockholder of the Corporation (except the right to
receive from the Corporation the repurchase price against delivery to the
Corporation of evidence of ownership of such shares) shall cease. Upon
surrender in accordance with said notice of evidence of ownership of
Repurchased Stock so repurchased (properly assigned for transfer, if the
Board shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be
repurchased by the Corporation at par value.

  

### (B) If and to the extent that shares of stock of the Corporation
beneficially owned by any Person or its Related Persons are held of record by
any other Person, this Article V shall be enforced against such Record Owner
by requiring the sale of shares of stock of the Corporation held by such
Record Owner in accordance with this Article V, in a manner that will
accomplish the Concentration Limitation applicable to such Person and its
Related Persons.

  

## Section 4. _Right to Information; Determinations by the Board_. The Board
shall have the right to require any Person and its Related Persons that the
Board reasonably believes (i) to be subject to the Voting Limitation or the
Recalculated Voting Limitation, (ii) to own beneficially (within the meaning
of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote on any matter in excess of the Concentration
Limitation, or (iii) to own beneficially (within the meaning of Rules 13d-3
and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) an aggregate of 5% or more of the then
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any
matter, which ownership such Person, either alone or together with its
Related Persons, has not reported to the Corporation, to provide to the
Corporation, upon the Boards request, complete information as to all shares
of stock of the

  



        
   

  



  

## Corporation beneficially owned by such Person and its Related Persons and
any other factual matter relating to the applicability or effect of this
Articles V as may reasonably be requested of such Person and its Related
Persons. Any constructions, applications or determinations made by the Board
pursuant to Articles V in good faith and on the basis of such information and
assistance as was then reasonably available for such purpose shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Corporation and its directors, officers and
stockholders.

circumstances, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time
exclusively by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Directors then in office.

  

## Section 4. _Election of Directors_. The directors shall be elected by the
stockholders at each annual meeting of stockholders (or any adjournment or
continuation thereof) at which a quorum is present, to hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders, but shall continue to serve despite the

action that may involve or relate to a change or potential change in the
control of the Corporation, a director of the Corporation may consider, among
other things, both the long-term and short-term interests of the Corporation
and its stockholders and the effects that the Corporations actions may have
in the short term or long term upon any one or more of the following matters:

  

#### (1) the prospects for potential growth, development, productivity and
profitability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries;

  

#### (2) the current employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries;

beneficiaries receiving or entitled to receive retirement, welfare or similar
benefits from or pursuant to any plan sponsored, or agreement entered into,
by the Corporation or its subsidiaries;

  

#### (4) the customers and creditors of the Corporation or its subsidiaries;

  

#### (5) the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to provide, as a
going concern, goods, services, employment opportunities and employment
benefits and otherwise to contribute to the communities in which they do
business;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (6) the potential impact on the relationships of the Corporation or its
subsidiaries with regulatory authorities and the regulatory impact generally;
and

  

#### (7) such other additional factors as a director may consider appropriate
in such circumstances.

  

In discharging his or her responsibilities as a member of the Board, each
director also must, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, take
into consideration the effect that the Corporations actions would have
on the ability of the Regulated Subsidiaries to carry out their
responsibilities under the Exchange Act and on the ability of the Regulated
Subsidiaries and the Corporation (i) to engage in conduct that fosters and
does not interfere with the Regulated Subsidiaries and the Corporations
ability to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in the
securities markets; (ii) to promote just and equitable principles of trade in

Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act) may be a director or officer of the
Corporation.

  

# **ARTICLE VIII 
  
 STOCKHOLDER ACTION**

  

## Section 1. _No Action by Written Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected
at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.

  

## Section 2. _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders of the Corporation,
except where otherwise required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation,
the holders of a

  



        
   

  



  

## majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum (it being understood that any
shares in excess of the Voting Limitation or the Recalculated Voting
Limitation shall not be counted as present at the meeting and shall not be
counted as outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation for purposes of
determining whether there is a quorum, unless and only to the extent that the
Voting Limitation or the Recalculated Voting Limitation, as applicable, shall
have been duly waived pursuant to Section 1 or Section 2 of Article V). For
purposes of the foregoing, where a separate vote by class or classes is
required for any matter, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of such class or classes entitled to vote, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with
respect to that vote on that matter. In the absence of a quorum of the
holders of any class of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on
a matter, the meeting of such class may be adjourned from time to time until
a quorum of such class shall be so present or represented. Shares of
its own capital stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation,
if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of
such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation,
shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held
by it in a fiduciary capacity, _provided_ , _further_ , that any such shares
of the Corporations own capital stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity
shall be voted by the person presiding over any vote in the same proportions
as the shares of capital stock held by the other stockholders are voted
(including any abstentions from voting).

  

If this Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote
for any share of stock of the Corporation on any matter or to the extent
a stockholder is prohibited pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation
from casting votes with respect to any shares of stock of the Corporation,
every reference in the bylaws of the Corporation to a majority or other
proportion of shares of stock of the Corporation shall refer to such majority
or other proportion of the aggregate votes of such shares of stock, taking
into account any greater or lesser number of votes as a result of the
foregoing.

  

## Section 3. _Amendment of Bylaws_. Stockholders may amend or repeal the
Bylaws of the Corporation only pursuant to Section 7.10(B) of the Bylaws.

  



  

# **ARTICLE IX 
  
 DIRECTOR LIABILITY**

  

A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director
of the Corporation, except to the extent that such exemption from liability
or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect
or as the same may hereafter be amended.

  

No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article IX shall adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation that exists
at the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

position, shall be deemed to waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion,
as a defense or otherwise in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claims
that it or they are not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC,
that such suit, action or proceeding is an inconvenient forum or that the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that the subject
matter thereof may not be enforced in or by such courts or agency.

  

## Section 2. _Submission to Jurisdiction of European Regulators_.  The
Corporation, its directors and officers and employees shall be deemed to
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the European Regulators and to
courts in the capital city of the country of each such regulator for
the purposes of any suit, action or proceeding pursuant to the European
Exchange Regulations and the rules and regulations thereunder, commenced or
initiated by the European Regulators arising out of, or relating to, the
activities of the Corporations European subsidiaries, and the Corporation
and each such director, officer or employee, in the case of any such

position, shall be deemed to waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion,

authority to

  



        
   

  



  

adjourn a meeting of stockholders without a vote of stockholders and
to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts

## Section 2.7 _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at
any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter
in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy,
but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is
coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation
generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by
attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date with a Corporate Secretary.  Voting at meetings of stockholders need not
be by written ballot unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting or the
Board of Directors. Subject to Section 3.2, directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. In
all other matters, unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the votes cast for or against
the matter at the meeting by stockholders entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by class
or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority (or, in the case of an election of directors, a plurality) of the
votes cast for or against the matter at the meeting by stockholders in that
class or classes entitled to vote on the subject matter

  



        
   

  



  

## -shall be the act of such class or classes, except as otherwise required
by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

  

## Section 2.8 _Stockholders Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may
determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may,
except as otherwise required by the DGCL, fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date: (1)
in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting
of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by
law, not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such
meeting and (2) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty
days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination
of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting
of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

  

## Section 2.9 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. A complete list of
the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical
order, with the address of each, and the number of shares held by each, shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days
prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation
or at such other location as specified in the notice of the meeting. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
entitled to be present.

  

## Section 2.10 _Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominees for Director and
Other Stockholder Proposals_.

  

#### (A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the
stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to
the Corporations notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a
stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in
this Section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with
the notice procedures set forth in this Section.

  

##### (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of
this

  



        
   

  



  

##### Section, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in
writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such other business must
otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. For nominations, such
notice must include the documentation necessary to determine whether
the nominee is a U.S. Person or a European Person as of the date of such
notice. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later
than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of
the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after
such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day
on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the
Corporation.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of
an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a
stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice shall set
forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person
that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of
directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such
persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee
and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that
the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of
the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons
for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in
such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal
is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on
the Corporations books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and
number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of
record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.

  

##### (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2)
of this Bylaw to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to
be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and
there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees
for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at
least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Bylaw shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

  

#### (B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_.  Only such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
before the meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting.
 Nominations of persons for election to the Board of

  



        
   

  



  

#### Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations notice of
meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided
that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at
such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of
record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw, who shall
be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this Bylaw. In the event that the Corporation calls
a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or
more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a
person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as
specified in the Corporations notice of meeting, if the stockholders notice

Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier
than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and
not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to
such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In
no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a special
meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice
as described above.

  

#### (C) _General_.

  

##### (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Bylaw shall be eligible to serve as directors
and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as
shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Bylaw.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman
of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made
or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Bylaw and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in
compliance with this Bylaw, to declare that such defective proposal or
nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action and shall be
disregarded.

  

##### (2) For purposes of this Bylaw, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document
publicly filed by the Corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  

##### (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Bylaw, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Bylaw.  Nothing in this Bylaw shall be deemed to
affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in
the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange
Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
directors under specified circumstances.

  

## Section 2.11 _No Stockholder Action by Written Consent_.  Subject to the
rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock with respect to such
series of Preferred Stock, any

  



        
   

  



  

## action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in

# **ARTICLE III. 
  
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS**

  

## Section 3.1 _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The
number of directors on the Board of Directors as of immediately after the
Effective Time (as defined in the Combination Agreement, dated as of June 1,
2006 (the " _Combination Agreement_ "), by and among the Corporation, NYSE
Group, Inc., Euronext N.V. and Jefferson Merger Sub, Inc.) shall be twenty
(20); _provided_ that the size of the Board of Directors may be changed and
fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by two-thirds of the directors then in office. For any
given size of the Board of Directors, the " _Minimum Threshold_ " of such
Board of Directors shall equal the number of directors on the Board of
Directors equal to the largest number of directors that nonetheless
represents a minority of the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors. In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon
them by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may exercise all such powers of
the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute
or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws required to be
exercised or done by the stockholders. A director need not be a stockholder.

  

## Section 3.2 _Certain Qualifications for the Board of Directors_.

  

#### (A) In any election of directors, and subject to Section 3.4, the
nominees whom shall be elected to the Board of Directors shall be nominees
who receive the highest number of votes such that, immediately after such
election, (1) European Persons as of such election shall constitute the
Minimum Threshold of the Board of Directors and (2) U.S. Persons as of such
election shall constitute a majority of the directors then in office.
Any nominee who is not elected in accordance with Section 3.2(A) of this
Article III shall not be qualified to serve as a director and therefore shall
not be elected to serve as a director. A " _European Person_ " shall mean,
as of any particular date, any person whose domicile as of such date is a
country in Europe and whose domicile for the twelve months ending on such
date shall have been a country in Europe. A " _U.S. Person_ " shall mean, as
of any particular date, any person whose domicile as of such date is the
United States and whose domicile for the twelve months ending on such date
shall have been the United States.

  

#### (B) The Nominating and Governance Committee shall nominate, and the
Board of Directors shall propose, at each meeting of stockholders at which
directors are elected, a slate of directors who, if elected, would meet the
requirements of Section 3.2(A) of this Article III.

  

## Section 3.3 _Certain Qualifications for the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer_. Either (a) the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be a U.S.
Person and the Chief Executive Officer shall be a European Person, in each
case, as of the most recent election of

  



        
   

  



  

## directors, or (b) the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be a
European Person and the Chief Executive Officer shall be a U.S. Person, in
each case, as of the most recent election of directors.

  

## Section 3.4 _Independence Requirements_. The Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation and Deputy Chief Executive Officer may be members of the
Board of Directors. All members of the Board of Directors, other than the
Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, shall satisfy
the independence requirements for directors of the Corporation, as modified
and amended by the Board of Directors from time to time. The Chief Executive
Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer shall be recused from
deliberations of the Board of Directors, whether it is acting as the Board of
Directors or as a committee of the Board of Directors, with respect to
activities of any committee of the Board of Directors that is required to be
comprised solely of directors that satisfy the independence requirements of
the Corporation, as modified and amended by the Board of Directors from time
to time.

  

## Section 3.5 _Election; Term of Office; Resignation_. Each director shall
hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his
or her earlier resignation or removal. Any director may resign at any time
upon written notice to the Board of Directors.  Such resignation shall take
effect at the time specified therein (and if no time be specified, at the
time of its receipt by the Board of Directors) and unless otherwise specified
therein no acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it
effective.

  

## Section 3.6 _Vacancies_. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors
resulting from death, retirement, resignation, disqualification or removal
from office or other cause, as well as any vacancy resulting from an increase
in the number of directors which occurs between annual meetings of the
stockholders at which directors are elected, shall be filled only by a
majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, or by the sole remaining director (and not by stockholders, unless
there shall be no remaining directors). If a vacancy results from the death,
retirement, resignation, disqualification or removal from office of a U.S.
Person or European Person as of the most recent election of directors, then
the director chosen to fill such vacancy shall be a U.S. Person or European
Person, respectively, as of the most recent election of directors. If a
vacancy results from an increase in the number of directors which occurs
between annual meetings of the stockholders at which directors are elected,
then a European Person as of the most recent election of directors shall fill
such vacancy if required in order for European Persons as of the most recent
election of directors to represent the Minimum Threshold of the Board of
Directors; otherwise, a U.S. Person as of the most recent election of
directors shall fill such vacancy. The directors chosen to fill any
vacancies shall hold office for a term expiring at the end of the next annual
meeting of stockholders, but shall continue to serve despite the expiration
of the directors term until his or her successor shall have been elected and
qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall shorten or eliminate the term of any incumbent director.
Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are
entitled by the Certificate of Incorporation to elect one or more directors,
vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series
may be filled by, and only by, a majority of the directors elected by such
class or classes or series then in office, or by the sole remaining director
so elected.  If the office of any director becomes vacant and there are no
remaining directors, the stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders
of shares constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation, at
a special meeting called for such purpose, may appoint any qualified person
to fill such vacancy.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 3.7 _Removal_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock with respect to such series of Preferred Stock,
any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at
any time, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of the then-outstanding shares of the
Corporations capital stock entitled to vote in an election of directors,
voting together as a single class.

  

## Section 3.8 _Meetings_. The newly elected directors may hold their first
meeting for the purpose of organization and the transaction of business, if a
quorum be present, immediately after the annual meeting of the stockholders;
or the time and place of such meeting may be fixed by consent of all the
Directors. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without
notice at such places and times as shall be determined from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Directors. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held with substantially equal frequency in the
United States and Europe. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever
called by a Chairman of the Board, the Deputy Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the
directors then in office, and shall be held at such place or places as may be
determined by the Board of Directors.

  

## Section 3.9 _Notice_. Notice of any special meeting of directors shall be
given to each director at his business or residence in writing by
hand delivery, first-class or overnight mail or courier service,
facsimile transmission, email or other electronic transmission or orally by
telephone not later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to such meeting. If
mailed by first-class mail, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered
when deposited in the United States mails so addressed, with postage thereon
prepaid, at least four (4) days before such meeting; _provided_ , that, any
notice sent by U.S. mail to an address outside of the United States will also
be sent by overnight mail or courier service to such director. If
by overnight mail or courier service, such notice shall be deemed
adequately delivered when the notice is delivered to the overnight mail or
courier service company at least twenty-four (24) hours before such meeting;
_provided_ , that, any notice sent by U.S. mail to an address outside of the
United States will also be sent by overnight mail or courier service to such
director. If by facsimile transmission, email or other electronic
transmission, such notice shall be deemed adequately delivered when the
notice is transmitted at least twenty-four (24) hours before such meeting. If
by telephone or by hand delivery, the notice shall be given at least twenty-
four (24) hours prior to the time set for the meeting. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of such meeting. A
meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are
present or if those not present waive notice of the meeting in accordance
with Section 7.3 of these Bylaws.

  

## Section 3.10 _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone
Permitted_. Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by
the Board, shall be entitled to participate in a meeting of the Board or of
such committee, as the case may be, by means of conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating
in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant
to this Bylaw shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

  



        
   

  



  

## Section 3.11 _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At each meeting of the
Board of Directors, a whole number of directors equal to at least a majority
of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors
(including any vacancies) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board unless the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall require a vote of a
greater number. The directors present at a duly organized meeting may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough directors to leave less than a quorum. In case at any
meeting of the Board a quorum shall not be present, the members or a majority
of the members of the Board present may adjourn the meeting from time to time
until a quorum shall be present.

  

## Section 3.12 _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall
be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or in
the absence of a Chairman of the Board of Directors, by the Deputy Chairman
of the Board, or in the absence of both the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman
of the Board, a chairman chosen at the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the Chairman of the Board of Directors or Deputy Chairman of the
Board of Directors is also the Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief
Executive Officer, he or she shall not participate in executive sessions of
the Board of Directors. If the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not the
Chief Executive Officer or Deputy Chief Executive Officer, he or she shall
act as a liaison officer between the Board of Directors and the
Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer. A Corporate
Secretary, or in the absence of a Corporate Secretary an Assistant Corporate
Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of a
Corporate Secretary and any Assistant Corporate Secretary the chairman of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

  

## Section 3.13 _Action by Directors Without a Meeting_. Any action required
or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any
committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board
or of such committee, as the case may be, then in office consent thereto in
writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board or committee.

  

## Section 3.14 _Compensation of Directors_. Directors may be paid such
compensation for their services and such reimbursement for expenses
of attendance at meetings as the Board of Directors may from time to
time determine. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
Corporation or any of its parents or subsidiaries in any other capacity and
receiving compensation for such service.

  

# **ARTICLE IV. 
  
 COMMITTEES**

  

## Section 4.1 _Committees of the Board of Directors_. The Board of
Directors may from time to time designate one or more committees of the Board
of Directors, with such lawfully delegable powers and duties as it thereby
confers, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors and shall, for
those committees and any others provided for herein, elect a director
or directors to serve as the member or members, designating, if it desires,
other directors as

  



        
   

  



  

## alternate members who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of
any committee and any alternate member in his or her place, the member or
members of the committee present at the meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not he or she or they constitute a quorum, may
by unanimous vote appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at
the meeting in the place of the absent or disqualified member. Subject to the
requirements of Section 4.4 of this Article IV, the Board of Directors shall
have power at any time to fill vacancies in, to change the membership of, or
to dissolve any such committee. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent
the Board of Directors from appointing one or more committees consisting in
whole or in part of persons who are not directors of the Corporation;
provided, however, that no such committee shall have or may exercise any
authority of the Board of Directors.

  

## Section 4.2 _Committee Procedures_. Each committee may determine the
procedural rules for meeting and conducting its business and shall act in
accordance therewith, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.

shall be made for notice of such meetings to be given to members of the
committees.

  

## Section 4.3 _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
provides, each committee designated by the Board may adopt, amend and repeal
rules for the conduct of its business.  In the absence of a provision by the
Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business unless the committee
shall consist of one (1) or two (2) members, in which event one (1) member
shall constitute a quorum.  The vote of a majority of the members present at
a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then present shall be the
act of such committee. Action may be taken by any committee without a meeting
if all members thereof consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of the proceedings
of such committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form.

  

## Section 4.4 _Nominating and Governance Committee_. The Nominating and
Governance Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of U.S. Persons
and European Persons as of the most recent election of directors.

  

# **ARTICLE V.

## Section 5.1 _Officers and Chairmen; Election or Appointment_.  The Board

hereafter be amended, to enable it to sign stock certificates. In addition,
the Board of Directors at any time and from time to time may elect (i) a

designations or alternate titles as it considers desirable.  In addition,
the Board of Directors at any time and from time to time may authorize any
officer of the Corporation to appoint one or more officers of the kind
described in clauses (iii) and (iv) above. Any number of offices may be held
by the same person and directors may hold any office unless the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws otherwise provide.

  

## Section 5.2 _Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_.  Unless
otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing or
authorizing the appointment of any officer, each officer shall hold office
until his or her successor is elected or appointed and qualified or until his
or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer may resign at any time
upon written notice to the Board or to such person or persons as the Board
may designate. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified
therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such
resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may remove any
officer with or without cause at any time. Any officer authorized by the
Board to appoint a person to hold an office of the Corporation may also
remove such person from such office with or without cause at any time, unless
otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board providing such
authorization. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board at any
regular or special meeting or by an officer authorized by the Board to
appoint a person to hold such office.

  

## Section 5.3 _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall
have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be
stated in these Bylaws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is
not inconsistent with these Bylaws and, to the extent not so stated, as

 STOCK CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFERS**

  

## Section 6.1 _Certificates; Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of stock in
the Corporation shall be represented by certificates; provided that the Board
of Directors of the Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that
some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be
uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to any such shares
represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. If shares of stock in the Corporation
are certificated, any signature on such certificates may be a facsimile. In
case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to
be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is
issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Certificates representing shares of stock of the Corporation may bear such
legends

  



        
   

  



  

## regarding restrictions on transfer or other matters as any officer or
officers of the Corporation may determine to be appropriate and lawful.

  

If the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or
more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class
of stock or series thereof and the qualifications or restrictions of
such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on
the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to
represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise
required by law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set
forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the
Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests
the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights of such class or series of stock and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.  Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer
of uncertificated shares of any class or series of stock, the Corporation
shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing
the information required by law to be set forth or stated on
certificates representing shares of such class or series or a statement that
the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so
requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights of such class or series and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.

  

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of
the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the
holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall
be identical.

  

## Section 6.2 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. No certificate for shares of stock in the Corporation shall be
issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or
stolen, except on production of such evidence of such loss, destruction or
theft and on delivery to the Corporation of a bond of indemnity in such
amount, upon such terms and secured by such surety, as the Board of Directors
or any financial officer may in its or his discretion require.

  

## Section 6.3 _Transfer of Shares_. The shares of stock of the Corporation
shall be transferable only upon its books by the holders thereof in person or
by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives, and upon such
transfer the old certificates shall be surrendered to the Corporation by the
delivery thereof to the person in charge of the stock and transfer books and
ledgers, or to such other person as the Board of Directors may designate, by
whom they shall be cancelled, and new certificates shall thereupon be issued.
 A record shall be made of each transfer and whenever a transfer shall
be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed
in the entry of the transfer.

  



        
   

  



  

# **ARTICLE VII.**

  

# **MISCELLANEOUS**

  

## Section 7.1 _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

  

## Section 7.2 _Seal_. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall
have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form
as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. The corporate
seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or
affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

  

## Section 7.3 _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before
or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of
such notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice or
any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

  

## Section 7.4 _Contracts_. Except as otherwise required by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any contracts or other
instruments may be executed and delivered in the name and on the behalf of
the Corporation by such officer or officers of the Corporation as the Board
of Directors may from time to time direct. Such authority may be general or
confined to specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of
the Board, the Deputy Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the
Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President may
execute bonds, contracts, deeds, leases and other instruments to be made or
executed for or on behalf of the Corporation. Subject to any restrictions
imposed by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board, the Deputy
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief
Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President of the Corporation may
delegate contractual powers to others under his jurisdiction, it being
understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve such
officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such
delegated power.

  

## Section 7.5 _Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided by resolution adopted by
the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Deputy Chairman of the
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the
President or any Vice President may from time to time appoint an attorney or
attorneys or agent or agents of the Corporation, in the name and on behalf of
the Corporation, to cast the votes which the Corporation may be entitled to
cast as the holder of stock or other securities in any other corporation, any
of whose stock or other securities may be held by the Corporation, at
meetings of the holders of the stock or other securities of such other
corporation, or to consent in writing, in the name of the Corporation as

  



        
   

  



  

## such holder, to any action by such other corporation, and may instruct the
person or persons so appointed as to the manner of casting such votes or
giving such consent, and may execute or cause to be executed in the name and
on behalf of the Corporation and under its corporate seal or otherwise, all
such written proxies or other instruments as he may deem necessary or proper
in the premises.

  

## Section 7.6 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

#### (A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "),
by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law, only to the extent
that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement,
and excise taxes or penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that, except as provided in paragraph (C) of this Section 7.6, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only
if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right
to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and
shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred
in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses
incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by
such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise.
The Corporation may, by action of the Board, provide indemnification to
employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the
foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. For purposes of this
Bylaw, the term " _Corporation_ " shall include any predecessor of
the Corporation and any constituent corporation (including any constituent of
a constituent) absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or merger.

  

#### (B) To obtain indemnification under this Section 7.6, a claimant shall
submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith
such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant
and is reasonably necessary to determine

  



        
   

  



  

#### whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification.
Upon written request by a claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first
sentence of this paragraph (B), a determination, if required by applicable
law, with respect to the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as
follows: (1) if requested by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as
hereinafter defined), or (2) if no request is made by the claimant for a
determination by Independent Counsel, (i) by the Board of Directors by
a majority of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even
though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of Disinterested
Directors designated by majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if
less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if a
majority of the Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in
a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be
delivered to the claimant, or (iv) if a majority of the Disinterested
Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event
that the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by
Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel
shall be selected by the Board of Directors unless there shall have occurred
within two years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or
proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a " _Change of Control_ ," in
which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant
unless the claimant shall request that such selection be made by the Board
of Directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to
indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within 10 days after
such determination.

  

#### (C) If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Section 7.6 is not paid in
full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim
pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 7.6 has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct that makes
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

  

#### (D) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to paragraph (B) of
this Section 7.6 that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the
Corporation shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding
commenced pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 7.6.

  

#### (E) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial
proceeding commenced pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 7.6 that the
procedures and

  



        
   

  



  

#### presumptions of this Bylaw are not valid, binding and enforceable
and shall stipulate in such proceeding that the Corporation is bound by all
the provisions of this Bylaw.

  

#### (F) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall in any
way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any
occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.

  

#### (G) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL. To the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy
or policies providing such insurance, each such director or officer, and each
such agent or employee to which rights to indemnification have been granted
as provided in paragraph (H) of this Section 7.6, shall be covered by such
policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the
maximum extent of the coverage thereunder for any such director, officer,
employee or agent.

  

#### (H) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be
paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation
to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section 7.6 with respect to
the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of
the Corporation.

  

#### (I) If any provision or provisions of this Section 7.6 shall be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:  (1) the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Section 7.6 (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of
this Section 7.6 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2)
to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Section
7.6 (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of
this Section 7.6 containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

  

#### (J) For purposes of this Section 7.6:

  

##### (1) " _Disinterested Director_ " means a director of the Corporation
who is not and was not a party to the matter in respect of which
indemnification is sought by the claimant.

  



        
   

  



  

##### (2) " _Independent Counsel_ " means a law firm, a member of a law firm,
or an independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation
law and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest
in representing either the Corporation or the claimant in an action to
determine the claimants rights under this Section 7.6.

  

##### (3) " _Change of Control_ " means the first to occur of:

  

###### (I) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (a " _Person_ ")
of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of either (A) the then-outstanding shares of
common stock of the Corporation (the " _Outstanding Common Stock_ ") or (B)
the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the
"Outstanding Voting Securities"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the following
acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control:  (i) any acquisition
directly from the Corporation, (ii) any acquisition by the Corporation, (iii)
any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
maintained by the Corporation or any affiliated corporation; or (iv) any
acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with
clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subsection (III);

  

###### (II) Any transaction as a result of which the individuals who, prior
to the commencement of the transaction or the efforts to consummate the same,
constituted the Board of Directors (the " _Incumbent Board_ ") cease in
connection with the transaction to constitute at least a majority of the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that any individual becoming a
director whose election, or nomination for election by the Corporations
stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such
individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this
purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the
election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation
of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board of
Directors;

  

###### (III) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share
exchange or consolidation or similar corporate transaction

the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries (each, a " _Business Combination_ "), in each case
unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of
the individuals and entities that were the beneficial owners of the
Outstanding Common Stock and the Outstanding Voting Securities immediately
prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the
Corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without
limitation, a corporation that, as a result of such transaction, owns the
Corporation or all or substantially all of the Corporations assets either
directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination
of the Outstanding Common Stock and the Outstanding Voting Securities, as the
case may be, (B) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such
Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the
Corporation or such corporation resulting from such Business Combination)
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of, respectively, the
then-outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from
such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then-
outstanding voting securities of such corporation, except to the extent that

corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the
Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or of
the action of the Board providing for such Business Combination; or

  

###### (IV) Approval by the stockholders of the Corporation of a complete

mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Corporation and shall be
effective only upon receipt by the Secretary.

law, any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its
business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may
be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs,
microphotographs or any other information storage device, provided that the
records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form within a
reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon
the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.

  

## Section 7.8 _Laws and Regulations; Close of Business_.  For purposes of
these Bylaws, any reference to a statute, rule or regulation of any
governmental body means such statute, rule or regulation (including any
successor thereto) as the same currently exists or may be amended from time
to time. Any reference in these Bylaws to the close of business on any day
shall be deemed to mean 5:00 P.M. New York time on such day, whether or not
such day is a business day.

  

## Section 7.9 _Certain Extraordinary Transactions_. The affirmative vote of
at least two-thirds of the directors then in office shall be required for (a)

sale or disposition by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of assets
or equity securities where the consideration received in respect of such
assets or equity securities has a fair market value, measured as of the date

sale or disposition (or, if no definitive agreement is executed for such
acquisition, sale or disposition, the date of the consummation of such
acquisition, sale or disposition), in excess of 30% of the aggregate equity
market capitalization of the Company as of such date; (ii) a merger or
consolidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any entity with
an aggregate equity market capitalization (or, if such entitys equity
securities shall not be traded on a national securities exchange, with a fair
market value of assets), measured as of the date of the execution of the
definitive agreement providing for such merger or consolidation (or, if no
definitive agreement is executed for such merger or consolidation, the date
of the consummation of such merger or consolidation), in excess of 30% of the
aggregate equity market capitalization of the Company as of such date; or
(iii) any direct or indirect acquisition by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries of assets or equity securities of an entity whose principal
place of business is outside of the United States or Europe, or any merger or
consolidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with an entity whose
principal place of business is outside of the United States or Europe,
pursuant to which the Corporation has agreed that one or more directors of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be a person who is neither a
U.S. Person nor a European Person as of the most recent election of
directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the transactions
contemplated by the Combination Agreement, including the Merger, the Offer
and the Post-Closing Reorganization (each as defined in the Combination
Agreement), shall constitute an Extraordinary Transaction.

  

## Section 7.10 _Amendment of Bylaws_.

by the Board of Directors, other than pursuant to an affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the directors then in office.

  

#### (B) Stockholders of the Corporation may amend or repeal any Bylaw;
_provided_ that notice of the proposed change was given in the notice of the
stockholders meeting at which such action is to be taken and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of stock of the Corporation required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, (1) the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the then-outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the
stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10,
4.4, 7.9, 7.10(A) or 7.10(B) of these Bylaws; and (2) the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of
the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any
other Section of these Bylaws.

  

#### (C) Notwithstanding paragraph (A) of this Section 7.10, for so long as
the Corporation shall control, directly or indirectly, any of New York Stock
Exchange LLC, NYSE Market, Inc., NYSE Regulation, Inc., Archipelago Exchange,
L.L.C., the NYSE Arca, Inc. or NYSE Arca Equities, Inc., before any amendment
or repeal of any provision of these Bylaws shall be effective, such amendment
or repeal shall be submitted to the boards of directors of the New York Stock
Exchange LLC, NYSE Market, Inc., NYSE Regulation, Inc., the NYSE Arca, Inc.
and NYSE Arca Equities, Inc., and if any or all of such boards of directors
shall determine that such amendment or repeal must be filed with or filed
with and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 19
of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder before such
amendment or repeal may be effectuated, then such amendment or repeal shall
