estimated amount of cash sufficient to make all payments required to be made pursuant
to this Article III, in exchange for Certificates representing outstanding
shares of CCBI Common Stock in accordance with this Article III (such cash
amount, the &#147;Exchange Fund&#148;). The Exchange Agent shall invest such deposited
cash as directed by Washington Mutual, provided that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of CCBI Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration provided in Section 3.01 and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the shares of CCBI Common Stock represented thereby with a
record date prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the

At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of CCBI shall be

the shares of CCBI Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, holders of CCBI Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of CCBI

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of
CCBI for six months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any
investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Washington
Mutual. Any shareholders of CCBI who have not theretofore complied with Section
3.02(b) shall thereafter look only to Washington Mutual for the Merger
Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon deliverable in
respect of each share of CCBI Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates for shares of CCBI Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment
for them is not claimed prior to the date on which the applicable Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by
abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of
Washington Mutual (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered
to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this
Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate
for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Washington Mutual and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of CCBI to establish
the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, Washington Mutual and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.  </FONT></P>

duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have nor reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI.  CCBI has in effect all federal, state, local
and foreign governmental authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.  The copies of the CCBI Articles and CCBI
Bylaws which have previously been made available to Washington Mutual are true,
complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.  The minute books of CCBI and
each of its Subsidiaries previously made available to Washington Mutual contain
true, complete and correct records in all material respects of all meetings and
other material corporate actions held or taken since December 31, 2002 of their
respective stockholders and Board of Directors (including committees of their

non-qualified under Section 422 of the Code, the number of shares of CCBI
Common Stock subject to each CCBI Option, the number of shares of CCBI Common

No agreement pursuant to which any loans or other assets have been or shall be
sold by CCBI or its Subsidiaries entitled the buyer of such loans or other
assets, unless there is material breach of a representation or covenant by CCBI
or its Subsidiaries, to cause CCBI or its Subsidiaries to repurchase such loan
or other asset or the buyer to pursue any other form of recourse against CCBI
or its Subsidiaries. Section 5.03(g) of CCBI&#146;s Disclosure Schedule sets forth
all cash, stock or other dividend or any other distribution with respect to the
capital stock of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries that has been declared, set
aside or paid, as well as all shares of capital stock of CCBI that have been
purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, by CCBI or
any of its Subsidiaries and no agreements have been made by CCBI or any of its
Subsidiaries to do any of the foregoing. </FONT></P>

The records, systems, controls, data and information of CCBI and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of CCBI or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section
5.03(g)(vi). CCBI (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to CCBI, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
CCBI by others within those entities and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to CCBI&#146;s outside auditors and the
audit committee of the CCBI Board (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect CCBI&#146;s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in CCBI&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to CCBI&#146;s auditors and audit committee and a
copy has previously been made available to Washington Mutual. The Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of CCBI have signed, and CCBI
has furnished to the SEC, all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1350; such certifications contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not been
modified or withdrawn; and neither CCBI nor any of its officers has received
notice from any Governmental Authorities questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certifications.
As of the date hereof, CCBI has no reason to believe that its outside auditors
and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give, without qualification, the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due. </FONT></P>

Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in all material

CCBI agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the CCBI Articles

approval of this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by

adjournment or postponement, the &#147;CCBI Meeting&#148;). Except with the prior written
approval of Washington Mutual, no other matters shall be submitted for the
approval of the CCBI stockholders at the CCBI Meeting. The CCBI Board shall at
all times prior to and during such meeting recommend such approval and shall
take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its stockholders
and, subject to Section 6.02(b), shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to Washington Mutual such recommendation or (y) take any
other action or make any other public statement in connection with the CCBI
Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a &#147;Change in
Recommendation&#148;), except as and to the extent permitted by Section 6.02(b).
Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted
to the stockholders of CCBI at the CCBI Meeting for the purpose of approving
the Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by CCBI&#146;s
stockholders for consummation of the Transaction. In addition to the foregoing,
CCBI shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal

Washington Mutual pursuant to clause (C) below, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) CCBI shall notify Washington Mutual, at

Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to Washington Mutual a

legal advisors to, during the period following CCBI&#146;s delivery of the notice
referred to in clause (B) above, negotiate with Washington Mutual in good faith
for a period of up to five Business Days (to the extent Washington Mutual
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and condition of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a

specifically enforcing the terms thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction.
From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, CCBI shall not, and
shall cause its directors, officers or employees (and those of any CCBI
Subsidiary) or any Representative retained by it (or any Subsidiary) not to,
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take
any other action designed to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential
information or data to any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual &#147;standstill&#148; or similar obligations of any Person other than
Washington Mutual or its affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that prior to the date of the CCBI Meeting, if the
CCBI Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal
and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would breach, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, the CCBI Board&#146;s fiduciary
duties under applicable law, CCBI may, in response to a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 6.08(a) that
the CCBI Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), subject to providing 48 hour prior written notice of its
decision to take such action to Washington Mutual and identifying the person
making the proposal and all the material terms and conditions of such proposal
and compliance with Section 6.08(b), (1) furnish information with respect to
itself and its Subsidiaries to any person making such a Superior Proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by CCBI after
consultation with its outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such
person than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Washington Mutual, and (2) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
such a Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, the term &#147;Acquisition
Proposal&#148; means any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory
application or notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an
intention to do any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10% or more
of the total revenues, net income, assets or deposits of CCBI and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase
of any class of Equity Securities representing 10% or more of the voting power
of CCBI or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (y) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or
more of any class of Equity Securities of CCBI or (z) merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving CCBI or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term &#147;Superior Proposal&#148; means any bona fide written proposal made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the shares of CCBI Common Stock then outstanding or
all or substantially all of CCBI&#146;s consolidated assets, which the CCBI Board
determines in good faith, after taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal
(including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation), and after taking into account the advice of CCBI&#146;s financial
advisors (which </FONT></P>

In addition to the obligations of CCBI set forth in Section 6.08(a), CCBI shall
promptly (within 24 hours) advise Washington Mutual orally and in writing of
its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) and keep Washington Mutual informed, on a current basis,
of the continuing status thereof, including the terms and conditions thereof

GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and
regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation
and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is
consistent with that of Washington Mutual; provided, however, that no such
modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and further provided that in any
event, no accrual or reserve made by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 6.09 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of
or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have
occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply
any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information
and shall not be construed as concurrence of CCBI or its management with any

From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the

and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of CCBI or a
CCBI Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the

the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of CCBI or any CCBI Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of CCBI or
any of the CCBI Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the Transaction,
to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under
the CCBI Articles and the CCBI Bylaws or equivalent documents of any CCBI
Subsidiary, as applicable, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding which
has been Previously Disclosed by CCBI pursuant to this Section 6.10, in each

Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying
Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties that make
joint representation inappropriate, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which
may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall
have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. </FONT></P>

Prior to the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall cause the persons serving
as directors and officers of CCBI immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
covered by the directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policy maintained
by CCBI for a period of six years after the Effective Time (provided that
Washington Mutual may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate
not materially less advantageous than such policy or single premium tail
coverage with policy limits equal to CCBI&#146;s existing coverage limits) with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were
committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, provided
that in no event shall Washington Mutual be required to expend for any one year
an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by CCBI for
such insurance (the &#147;Insurance Amount&#148;), and further provided that if
Washington Mutual is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this Section 6.10(c) as a result of the preceding provision, Washington Mutual
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous coverage
as is available for the Insurance Amount. </FONT></P>

As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, Washington
Mutual shall take all reasonable action so that employees of CCBI and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Washington Mutual of general applicability (the
&#147;Washington Mutual Benefit Plans&#148;) to the same extent as similarly-situated
employees of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that
inclusion of the employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries in the Washington
Mutual Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different
plans), provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit
Plans of CCBI and its Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to
participate in the Washington Mutual Benefit Plans and provided further,
however, that nothing contained herein shall require Washington Mutual or any
of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of CCBI under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual
shall cause each Washington Mutual Benefit Plan in which employees of CCBI and
its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all
other purposes (but not for purposes of eligibility to participate in, vesting
of benefits under or accrual of benefits under, any defined benefit pension
plan) under the Washington Mutual Benefit Plans, the service of such employees
with CCBI and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited
for such purpose by CCBI, provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of CCBI and
its Subsidiaries that correspond to Washington Mutual Benefit Plans until
employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries are included in such Washington Mutual
Benefit Plans, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Washington Mutual to
amend or terminate any of CCBI&#146;s Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the
extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms. </FONT></P>

At and following the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall honor, and the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance
with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of,
current and former employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries and current and
former directors of CCBI and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective
Date, as well as all employment, severance, bonus, salary continuation,
deferred compensation, split dollar, supplemental retirement or

each of the foregoing are Previously Disclosed. The severance or termination

CCBI (which have been quantified in reasonable detail) have been Previously
Disclosed. </FONT></P>

At such time as employees and current and former directors of CCBI and its

such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such
conditions covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of

deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees

Each of CCBI, its Subsidiaries, and Washington Mutual acknowledges and agrees
that all provisions contained within this Section 6.11 with respect to
Employees and directors are included for the sole benefit of CCBI and

As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later
than one (1) Business Day prior to the day the Proxy Statement is mailed to
stockholders in accordance with Section 6.03(a), CCBI shall obtain from each
Executive an acknowledgement and agreement, in a form to be provided by Washington
Mutual as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, that the
Executive is not entitled to receive any amount of payment or benefit in excess
of their respective Change in Control Benefit (as set forth in Section
5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule, which shall be adjusted as
provided therein and set forth in such acknowledgement and agreement), and
otherwise that (i) such Change in Control Benefit represents the maximum amount
of payments and benefits with respect to which the Executive has any right to
receive, and (ii) that the amount that shall also be set forth in such
acknowledgement and agreement as reflecting the Executive&#146;s Gross-Up Payment
represents a good faith estimate of such actual Gross-Up Payment, in each case
due in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or
otherwise in connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement (other than the payments to which the Executive shall
otherwise be entitled to receive with respect to shares of CCBI Common Stock
held by the Executive pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article III of

CCBI and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts, but shall

Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material

Mutual, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this

broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.  In all such
cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a
valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable,
implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement.  </FONT></P>

such relief on the basis that Washington Mutual may have an adequate remedy at

Washington Mutual&#146;s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the acquisition of Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, by Washington Mutual, Inc. (&#147;Assignee&#148;), and the corresponding
assignment of the above referenced Lease, the undersigned Tenant hereby certifies
to Assignee that the following statements are true, correct and complete as of
the date hereof: </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Tenant
is the tenant under the Lease for the Premises. There have been no amendments,
modifications or revisions to the Lease, and there are no agreements of any
kind between Landlord and Tenant regarding the Premises, except as provided in
the attached Lease. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Attached
hereto as Schedule A is a true, correct and complete copy of the Lease which
has been duly authorized and executed by Tenant and which is in full force and
effect. </FONT> </P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Tenant
has accepted and is in sole possession of the Premises and is presently
occupying the Premises. The Lease has not been assigned, by operation of law or
otherwise, by Tenant, and no sublease, concession agreement or license,
covering the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, has been entered into by
Tenant. If the landlord named in the Lease is other than Landlord, Tenant has
received notice of the assignment to Landlord of the landlord&#146;s interest in the
Lease and Tenant recognizes Landlord as the landlord under the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;No
rent under the Lease has been paid more than one (1) month in advance, and no
other sums or security deposits have been deposited with Landlord, except in
the amount of $__________.&nbsp;(If
none, state &#147;NONE&#148;). Tenant is not entitled to rent concessions or free rent. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;All
conditions and obligations of Landlord relating to completion of tenant
improvements and making the Premises ready for occupancy by Tenant have been
satisfied or performed and all other conditions and obligations under the Lease
to be satisfied or performed by Landlord as of the date hereof have been fully
satisfied or performed. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;There
exists no defense to, or right of offset against, enforcement of the Lease by
Landlord. Neither Landlord nor Tenant is in default under the Lease and no
event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or passage of time, or
both, could result in such a default. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Tenant
has not received any notice of any present violation of any federal, state,
county or municipal laws, regulations, ordinances, orders or directives
relating to the use or condition of the Premises. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Except

additional space with in the Premises; (c) any right to terminate the Lease
prior to its stated expiration; or (d) any option or right of first refusal to
purchase the Premises or any part thereof. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT Face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Tenant
acknowledges having been notified that Landlord&#146;s interest in and to the Lease

however, Tenant will continue to make all payments under the Lease to Landlord
and otherwise look solely to Landlord for the performance of the Landlord&#146;s
obligations under the Lease. </FONT></P>
