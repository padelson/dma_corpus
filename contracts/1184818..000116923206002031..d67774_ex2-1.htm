ARTICLE III

  

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  

 3.01  _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Person: 

     

 (a)  _Outstanding Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b)  _Treasury Stock_. Each share of CCBI Common Stock held as Treasury Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c)  _Effect on CCBI Common Stock_. Each share of CCBI Common Stock, except for shares of Treasury Stock, shall be converted, by virtue of the Merger, into the right to receive $16.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). 

  

 3.02  _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, Washington Mutual shall deliver to the Exchange Agent an estimated amount of cash sufficient to make all payments required to be made pursuant to this Article III, in exchange for Certificates representing outstanding shares of CCBI Common Stock in accordance with this Article III (such cash amount, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest such deposited cash as directed by Washington Mutual, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500 million. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to Washington Mutual. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of CCBI Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury Stock) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Section 3.01 and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the shares of CCBI Common Stock represented thereby with a record date prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate form of assignment separate from the Certificate) and otherwise 

     

in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not payable.

  

 (d) At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of CCBI shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of CCBI of the shares of CCBI Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, holders of CCBI Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of CCBI other than to receive the consideration provided under this Article III. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided herein. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of CCBI for six months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Washington Mutual. Any shareholders of CCBI who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.02(b) shall thereafter look only to Washington Mutual for the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon deliverable in respect of each share of CCBI Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of CCBI Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which the applicable Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Washington Mutual (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Washington Mutual and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of CCBI to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Washington Mutual and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto. 

  

 (f) Washington Mutual (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of CCBI Common Stock such amounts as Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or applicable law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of CCBI Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Washington Mutual. 

  

 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to 

     

be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Washington Mutual, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Washington Mutual may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 3.03  _Treatment of Employee Equity_. At the Effective Time, each CCBI Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of CCBI Common Stock subject to such CCBI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such CCBI Option (the "Option Merger Consideration") less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise price per share of any such CCBI Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such CCBI Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. 

  

 3.04  _Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, or on such later date as Washington Mutual shall specify, Washington Mutual and CCBI shall cause WMB and CCB to enter into the Bank Merger Agreement, which provides for the merger of CCB with and into WMB (the "Bank Merger"), in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement and as soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger (or on such later date as Washington Mutual shall specify). The Bank Merger Agreement provides that the directors of WMB upon consummation of the Bank Merger shall be the directors of WMB immediately prior to the Bank Merger.

 5.02  _Standard_. Solely for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be, has been satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or warranty made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of CCBI or Washington Mutual contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04, respectively, other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.03(b), the last sentence of Section 5.03(m)(vi), and Sections 5.03(m)(viii) and (ix), which shall be true in all material respects, shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of Section 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent

misleading; and each of the consolidated statements of financial condition
contained in any such Securities Documents (including the related notes and
schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated
financial position of CCBI and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of
the consolidated statements of income, stockholdersÂ’ equity and comprehensive
income and cash flows or equivalent statements in such Securities Documents
(including any related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will
fairly present, the consolidated statements of income, stockholdersÂ’ equity
and comprehensive income and cash flows or equivalent statements, as the case
may be, of CCBI and its Subsidiaries for the periods to which they relate, in
each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except in each case as may be noted therein. Each of such financial
statements (including any related notes and schedules thereto) complies in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. The books
and records of CCBI and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.

  

 (ii) CCBI has filed all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 2002. None of CCBIÂ’s Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. CCBI has made available to Washington Mutual true, correct and complete copies of all written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and CCBI and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since December 31, 2002. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to CCBIÂ’s Securities Documents. To the knowledge of CCBI, none of the CCBIÂ’s Securities Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. 

  

 (iii) Except as set forth on the balance sheet of CCBI dated as of December 31, 2005 and included in CCBIÂ’s Securities Documents filed prior to the date hereof, neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability (whether absolute, contingent or accrued or otherwise and whether due or to become due) other than liabilities incurred after December 31, 2005 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, there is no existing condition, event or circumstance which could result in any such material liability in the future. 

  

 (iv) Since December 31, 2005, (A) CCBI and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice, (B) except as Previously Disclosed, neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken nor permitted or entered into any contract with respect to, or otherwise agreed or committed to do or take, any of the actions set forth in Section 4.01, other than any such actions that (1) were taken in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (2) were not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, operations or financial condition of CCBI and (3) did not have and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCBI and (C) no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of this Section 5.03 or otherwise), has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCBI. 

     

 (v) No agreement pursuant to which any loans or other assets have been or shall be sold by CCBI or its Subsidiaries entitled the buyer of such loans or other assets, unless there is material breach of a representation or covenant by CCBI or its Subsidiaries, to cause CCBI or its Subsidiaries to repurchase such loan or other asset or the buyer to pursue any other form of recourse against CCBI or its Subsidiaries. Section 5.03(g) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule sets forth all cash, stock or other dividend or any other distribution with respect to the capital stock of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries that has been declared, set aside or paid, as well as all shares of capital stock of CCBI that have been purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries and no agreements have been made by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 (vi) The records, systems, controls, data and information of CCBI and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of CCBI or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 5.03(g)(vi). CCBI (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to CCBI, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of CCBI by others within those entities and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to CCBIÂ’s outside auditors and the audit committee of the CCBI Board (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect CCBIÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in CCBIÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to CCBIÂ’s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Washington Mutual. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of CCBI have signed, and CCBI has furnished to the SEC, all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1350; such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn; and neither CCBI nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Authorities questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such certifications. As of the date hereof, CCBI has no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give, without qualification, the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due. 

  

 (vii) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (i) neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of CCBI, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) 

     

no attorney representing CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to the CCBI Board or any committee thereof or,
to the knowledge of CCBI, to any director or officer of CCBI.

  

 (h)  _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in Section 5.03(h) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule, no litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding before any court or governmental agency is pending against CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries and, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, no such litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding has been threatened and there are no facts which could reasonably give rise to such litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding. Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is a party to or subject to any order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCBI. 

  

 (i)  _Regulatory Matters_. 

  

 (i) Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree, directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, nor has CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any Governmental Authority. CCBI and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments made or imposed by any Governmental Authority. 

  

 (ii) Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has been advised by, nor does it have any knowledge of facts which could give rise to an advisory notice by, any Governmental Authority that such Governmental Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure or board resolution. 

  

 (iii) Except as Previously Disclosed, (i) no Governmental Authority has initiated since December 31, 2000 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of CCBI, investigation or inquiry into the business, operations, policies, practices or disclosures of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Authority in the ordinary course of the business of CCBI and its Subsidiaries), or, to the knowledge of CCBI, threatened any of the foregoing, and (ii) there is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Governmental Authority with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (j)  _Compliance With Laws_. Each of CCBI and its Subsidiaries: 

  

 (i) is and at all times since December 31, 2002 has been in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, codes, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, injunctions, orders, decrees or policies and/or guidelines of any Governmental Authority applicable thereto or to the employees conducting 

     

such businesses, including, without limitation, Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act and OTS regulations pursuant thereto, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, all
other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices and Environmental Laws and all posted and internal
policies of CCBI and its Subsidiaries relating to customer data, privacy and
security;

  

 (ii) has and at all times since December 31, 2002 has had all permits, licenses, franchises, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Authorities (and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith) that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses, franchises, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and 

  

 (iii) has received, since December 31, 2000, no notification or communication from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Governmental Authority enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization (nor, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, do any grounds for any of the foregoing exist). 

  

 (k)  _Material Contracts; Defaults_. 

  

 (i) Except for documents listed as exhibits to CCBIÂ’s Securities Documents, neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to any agreement, contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the employment of any of its directors, officers, employees or consultants, (ii) which would entitle any present or former director, officer, employee or agent of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to indemnification from CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries (other than as described in Section 5.03(k)(i)(ii) to CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule), (iii) which is a material contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iv) which is an agreement (including data processing, software programming, consulting and licensing contracts) not terminable on 60 days or less notice and involving the payment or value of more than $100,000 per annum, (v) which is with or to a labor union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement), (vi) which relates to the incurrence of indebtedness (other than deposit liabilities, advances and loans from the FHLB, and sales of securities subject to repurchase, in each case in the ordinary course of business), (vii) which grants any person a right of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right with respect to any material properties, rights, assets or businesses of CCBI or its Subsidiaries, (viii) which involves the purchase or sale of assets with a purchase price of $1,000,000 or more in any single case or $15,000,000 in all such cases, other than purchases and sales of investment securities and loans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ix) which is a consulting agreement, license or service contract (including data processing, software programming and licensing contracts and outsourcing contracts) which involve the payment of $100,000 or more in annual fees (other than any such agreement, license or contract listed in Section 5.03(k)(i)(ix) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule), (x) which provides for the payment by CCBI or its Subsidiaries of payments upon a change of control thereof other than as set forth in Section 5.03(k)(i)(x) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule, (xi) which is a lease for any real or material personal property owned or presently used by CCBI or any of its 

     

Subsidiaries, (xii) which materially restricts the conduct of any business by
CCBI or by any of its Subsidiaries or limits the freedom of CCBI or any of
its Subsidiaries to engage in any line of business in any geographic area (or
would so restrict the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates after
consummation of the Transaction) or which requires exclusive referrals of
business or requires CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to offer specified
products or services to their customers or depositors on a priority or
exclusive basis, or (xiii) which is with respect to, or otherwise commits
CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to do, any of the foregoing (collectively,
"Material Contracts"). CCBI has Previously Disclosed and made available to
Washington Mutual true and correct copies of each such Material Contract.

  

 (ii) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on CCBI and its Subsidiaries and is in full force and effect (other than due to the ordinary expiration thereof) and, to the knowledge of CCBI, is valid and binding on the other parties thereto. Neither CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of CCBI, any other parties thereto, is in material default under any contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its respective assets, business, or operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default. Except as provided in this Agreement, no power of attorney or similar authorization given directly or indirectly by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries is currently outstanding. 

  

 (iii) Section 5.03(k)(iii) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule sets forth a schedule of all officers and directors of CCBI and its Subsidiaries who have outstanding loans from CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding the date hereof. 

  

 (l)  _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finderÂ’s fee or other like payment with respect to the Transaction, excluding a Previously Disclosed fee to be paid to Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Sandler OÂ’Neill and Partners, L.P. Copies of all agreements with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Sandler OÂ’Neill and Partners, L.P. have been previously furnished to Washington Mutual. 

  

 (m)  _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") and current or former directors or independent contractors of CCBI and its Subsidiaries including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and severance, employment, change in control, fringe benefit, deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements (the "Benefit Plans"), have been Previously Disclosed to Washington Mutual. True and complete copies of (A) all Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a part of any Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto; (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), together with all schedules, as required, filed with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or Department of Labor (the "DOL"), as applicable, and any financial statements and opinions 

     

required by Section 103(e)(3) of ERISA with respect to each Benefit Plan; (C)
for each Benefit Plan which is a "top-hat" plan, a copy of filings with the
DOL; (D) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS for each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401(a) of the
Code; (E) the most recent summary plan description and any summary of
material modifications, as required, for each Benefit Plan; (F) the most
recent actuarial report, if any relating to each Benefit Plan; (G) the most
recent actuarial valuation, study or estimate of any retiree medical and life
insurance benefits plan or supplemental retirement benefits plan; and (H) the
most recent summary annual report for each Benefit Plan required to provide
summary annual reports by Section 104 of ERISA, have been provided or made
available to Washington Mutual.

  

 (ii) Each Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in all material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to which such Benefit Plan is maintained. Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and CCBI is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or written or verbal notice from the IRS, DOL, any other governmental agency, any participant in or beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing any of the foregoing that brings into question the qualification of any such Benefit Plan. There is no material pending or, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, threatened litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan or Pension Plan that could subject CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material. There are no matters pending before the IRS, DOL or other governmental agency with respect to any Benefit Plan. 

  

 (iii) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with CCBI under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and neither expects to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) under of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection with the Transaction. 

  

 (iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the financial statements of CCBI included in CCBIÂ’s Securities Documents. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither CCBI nor 

     

any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to
any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

 (v) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan, other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the laws of any state or locality. CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such Benefit Plan in accordance with and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time without incurring any liability thereunder. No event or condition exists with respect to a Benefit Plan that could subject CCBI to a material tax under Section 4980B of the Code. 

  

 (vi) None of the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of the Transaction, either along or in connection with a subsequent event, will, except as Previously Disclosed, (A) entitle any Employees or any current or former director or independent contractor of CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future. In connection with the foregoing, CCBI also represents and warrants as to the statements set forth on Section 5.03(m) of CCBIÂ’s Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (vii) All required reports and descriptions (including but not limited to Form 5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1 and summary plan descriptions) have been filed or distributed appropriately with respect to each Benefit Plan. All required tax filings with respect to each Benefit Plan have been made, and any taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. 

  

 (viii) Section 5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule sets forth the following: (A) the maximum amount of all payments and benefits to which each individual set forth on such schedule (each such person, an "Executive") is entitled to receive, pursuant to all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in control, and all other agreements, plans and arrangements (any such agreement, plan or arrangement, an "Executive Agreement"), in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, such amounts to be adjusted to take into account only those changes expressly identified in Section 5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule (each such total amount in respect of each such Executive, the "Change in Control Benefit"), other than the payment each such Executive shall otherwise be entitled to receive as a gross-up payment in respect of any excise tax imposed on the Executive pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code as calculated pursuant to the applicable Executive Agreement (each such payment, a "Gross-Up Payment"); and (B) the maximum aggregate amount of all Change in Control Benefits and Gross-Up Payments. 

     

 (ix) Except with respect to the twelve Executives who are parties to Benefit Plans that are "Split Dollar Agreements" and related "Executive Bonus Agreements", which agreements provide for the vesting of certain benefits under such agreements upon the closing of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (the "CIC Vesting"), and are identified in Section 5.03(m)(ix) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule (the "Executive Split Dollar Arrangements"), no other current or former director, employee or independent contractor is, or shall become, a party to any "Split Dollar Agreement" that provides for the vesting of any benefits upon the closing of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (either alone or in connection with any subsequent event). The seven Executives identified in Section 5.03(m)(ix) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule with asterisks have, as of the date hereof, irrevocably waived all rights they may have to the CIC Vesting under the Split Dollar Arrangements. 

  

 (n)  _Labor Matters_. Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to CCBIÂ’s knowledge, threatened, nor is CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any activity involving its employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity. Each of CCBI and its Subsidiaries has paid in full all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due to its employees or otherwise arising under any policy, practice, agreement, plan, program, statute or other law. 

  

 (o)  _Environmental Matters_. Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental investigations, remediation activities or governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that reasonably could be expected to result in the imposition, on CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Laws pending or, to the knowledge of CCBI, threatened against CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation could have or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the knowledge of CCBI, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action, environmental remediation or investigation that could impose any liability or obligation that could have or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the knowledge of CCBI, during or prior to the period of (i) its or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ ownership or operation of any of their respective current or former properties or facilities, (ii) its or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ participation in the management of any property or facility, or (iii) its or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ holding of a security interest or other interest in any property or facility, there were no releases, threatened releases or arranging for disposal of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under, from or affecting any such property or facility which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither CCBI nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court, Governmental Authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any material liability or obligation pursuant to or under any Environmental Law that 

     

could have or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI or its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

 (b) Each of CCBI and Washington Mutual agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to CCBIÂ’s stockholders and at the time of the CCBI Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of CCBI and Washington Mutual further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement. 

     

 6.04  _Regulatory Filings_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, each of Washington Mutual and CCBI and their respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Transaction; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Washington Mutual (and CCBI, if applicable) as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Washington Mutual to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Authorities or third parties that would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition. Each of Washington Mutual and CCBI shall have the right to review in advance, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all of the information relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made by the other party with, or written information submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transaction. 

  

 (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries (if applicable), directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority. 

  

 6.05  _Press Releases_. CCBI and Washington Mutual shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Transaction or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or regulations of the securities exchange on which it trades. CCBI and Washington Mutual shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the Transaction as reasonably requested by the other party. 

  

 6.06  _Access; Information_. 

  

 (a) CCBI agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Washington Mutual and Washington MutualÂ’s officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and advisors of CCBI and to such other information relating to CCBI as Washington Mutual may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to Washington Mutual (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws and federal or state banking, lending, consumer finance or privacy laws and (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of CCBI as Washington Mutual may reasonably request. 

     

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable and as soon as they are available, but in no event more than 15 days, after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, CCBI shall furnish to Washington Mutual (i) consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance sheet, income statement and statement of changes in stockholdersÂ’ equity) of CCBI and its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended and (ii) any key internal management reports relating to the foregoing. 

  

 (c) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Washington Mutual senior manager responsible for the integration of CCBI with Washington Mutual Previously Disclosed to CCBI, and the CCBI senior manager responsible for the integration of CCBI with Washington Mutual Previously Disclosed to Washington Mutual, shall confer on a regular basis regarding the business and operations of Washington Mutual and CCBI. 

  

 (d) All information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2006 between Washington Mutual and CCBI (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). 

  

 (e) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other parties set forth herein. 

  

 6.07  _Cooperation in Litigation_. CCBI agrees that during the period between the date hereof and the Effective Date, CCBI will consult on a regular and ongoing basis with Washington MutualÂ’s designated representatives regarding the defense by CCBI and its Subsidiaries of all actions, proceedings, arbitrations, claims and investigations pending against CCBI, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates during such period (collectively, the "Actions") and will furnish Washington Mutual with reasonable access to employees and other Persons under the control of CCBI and to such documents, records, testimony and other information as Washington Mutual may reasonably request in connection with such Actions. CCBI further agrees to consider and discuss in good faith such actions (including settlement opportunities) as may be reasonably proposed by Washington Mutual in an effort to minimize the cost of, and reduce or mitigate any damages or other adverse effects on Washington Mutual and its affiliates (including CCBI after the Effective Time) that might result from, such Actions. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall require CCBI or its Subsidiaries to take any action that would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of CCBI or such Subsidiary, and in such circumstance, the parties shall enter into such agreements as may be necessary or appropriate to preserve such privilege. 

  

 6.08  _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) CCBI agrees that it shall, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (including without limitation any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including by requesting the other party to promptly return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of CCBI thereunder 

     

and by specifically enforcing the terms thereof in a court of competent
jurisdiction. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
CCBI shall not, and shall cause its directors, officers or employees (and
those of any CCBI Subsidiary) or any Representative retained by it (or any
Subsidiary) not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
assistance), or take any other action designed to facilitate or that is
likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive, terminate,
modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual "standstill" or
similar obligations of any Person other than Washington Mutual or its
affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or
propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that prior to the date of the CCBI Meeting, if the CCBI
Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal and
financial advisors, that the failure to do so would breach, or
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, the CCBI BoardÂ’s
fiduciary duties under applicable law, CCBI may, in response to a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section
6.08(a) that the CCBI Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), subject to providing 48 hour prior written
notice of its decision to take such action to Washington Mutual and
identifying the person making the proposal and all the material terms and
conditions of such proposal and compliance with Section 6.08(b), (1) furnish
information with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries to any person making
such a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
(as determined by CCBI after consultation with its outside counsel) on terms
no more favorable to such person than the terms contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Washington Mutual, and (2) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior Proposal. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in
draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing
from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 10% or more of the total revenues,
net income, assets or deposits of CCBI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
(x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of Equity
Securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of CCBI or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any
class of Equity Securities of CCBI or (z) merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving CCBI or any of its Significant Subsidiaries,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more
than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares of CCBI Common Stock then
outstanding or all or substantially all of CCBIÂ’s consolidated assets, which
the CCBI Board determines in good faith, after taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions
and conditions to consummation), and after taking into account the advice of
CCBIÂ’s financial advisors (which

     

shall be nationally recognized investment banking firms) and outside counsel,
(i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than
the Merger, (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set
forth, and (iii) for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the CCBI Board, is
reasonably likely to be obtained by such third party.

  

 (b) In addition to the obligations of CCBI set forth in Section 6.08(a), CCBI shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise Washington Mutual orally and in writing of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal) and keep Washington Mutual informed, on a current basis, of the continuing status thereof, including the terms and conditions thereof and any changes thereto, and shall contemporaneously provide to Washington Mutual all materials provided to or made available to any third party pursuant to this Section 6.08 which were not previously provided to Washington Mutual. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, CCBI and the CCBI Board shall be permitted to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934; provided, however, that compliance with such rules will in no way limit or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) CCBI agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.08 by any Representative of CCBI or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.08 by CCBI. 

  

 6.09  _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, each of CCBI and its Subsidiaries, as may be requested by Washington Mutual, shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Washington Mutual; provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and further provided that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.09 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of CCBI or its management with any such adjustments. 

  

 6.10  _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Washington Mutual (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of CCBI or a CCBI Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or 

     

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of
or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of CCBI or any CCBI Subsidiary or is or was serving at the
request of CCBI or any of the CCBI Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation matters
related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or
consummation of the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified
Parties would be entitled under the CCBI Articles and the CCBI Bylaws or
equivalent documents of any CCBI Subsidiary, as applicable, or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding which has been Previously Disclosed by CCBI
pursuant to this Section 6.10, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall cause the persons serving as directors and officers of CCBI immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy maintained by CCBI for a period of six years after the Effective Time (provided that Washington Mutual may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not materially less advantageous than such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to CCBIÂ’s existing coverage limits) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall Washington Mutual be required to expend for any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by CCBI for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if Washington Mutual is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.10(c) as a result of the preceding provision, Washington Mutual shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

     

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each of the Indemnified Parties and his or her heirs. 

  

 6.11  _Benefit Plans_. 

  

 (a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall take all reasonable action so that employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Washington Mutual of general applicability (the "Washington Mutual Benefit Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries in the Washington Mutual Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans), provided that coverage shall be continued under corresponding Benefit Plans of CCBI and its Subsidiaries until such employees are permitted to participate in the Washington Mutual Benefit Plans and provided further, however, that nothing contained herein shall require Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of CCBI under any discretionary equity compensation plan of Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual shall cause each Washington Mutual Benefit Plan in which employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all other purposes (but not for purposes of eligibility to participate in, vesting of benefits under or accrual of benefits under, any defined benefit pension plan) under the Washington Mutual Benefit Plans, the service of such employees with CCBI and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by CCBI, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those Benefit Plans of CCBI and its Subsidiaries that correspond to Washington Mutual Benefit Plans until employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries are included in such Washington Mutual Benefit Plans, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Washington Mutual to amend or terminate any of CCBIÂ’s Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms. 

  

 (b) At and following the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall honor, and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of CCBI and its Subsidiaries and current and former directors of CCBI and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as well as all employment, severance, bonus, salary continuation, deferred compensation, split dollar, supplemental retirement or "change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of CCBI to the extent that each of the foregoing are Previously Disclosed. The severance or termination payments which are payable pursuant to such agreements, plans or policies of CCBI (which have been quantified in reasonable detail) have been Previously Disclosed. 

  

 (c) At such time as employees and current and former directors of CCBI and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Washington Mutual or its Subsidiaries, Washington Mutual shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Washington Mutual, (ii) provide full credit under such plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and directors and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to 

     

such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such
employee or director on or after the Effective Time to the extent such
employee or director had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (d) Each of CCBI, its Subsidiaries, and Washington Mutual acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained within this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees and directors are included for the sole benefit of CCBI and Washington Mutual and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including, Benefit Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with CCBI, its Subsidiaries, Washington Mutual or any of their respective affiliates. 

  

 (e) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the day the Proxy Statement is mailed to stockholders in accordance with Section 6.03(a), CCBI shall obtain from each Executive an acknowledgement and agreement, in a form to be provided by Washington Mutual as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, that the Executive is not entitled to receive any amount of payment or benefit in excess of their respective Change in Control Benefit (as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule, which shall be adjusted as provided therein and set forth in such acknowledgement and agreement), and otherwise that (i) such Change in Control Benefit represents the maximum amount of payments and benefits with respect to which the Executive has any right to receive, and (ii) that the amount that shall also be set forth in such acknowledgement and agreement as reflecting the ExecutiveÂ’s Gross-Up Payment represents a good faith estimate of such actual Gross-Up Payment, in each case due in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (other than the payments to which the Executive shall otherwise be entitled to receive with respect to shares of CCBI Common Stock held by the Executive pursuant to the applicable provisions of Article III of this Agreement (such payments, the "Merger Consideration Payments")). 

  

 (f) CCBI and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts, but shall not otherwise be under any legal obligation, to obtain, from each Executive who is not identified in Section 5.03(m)(ix) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule with an asterisk, an irrevocable waiver of all rights the Executive may have to any CIC Vesting under the ExecutiveÂ’s Split Dollar Arrangement. 

  

 6.12  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of CCBI and Washington Mutual shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein. 

  

 6.13  _Estoppel Letters_. CCBI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Washington Mutual at the Closing with respect to all real estate (i) owned by CCBI or its Subsidiaries, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex C from all tenants and (ii) leased by CCBI or its Subsidiaries, an estoppel letter dated as of the Closing in the form of Annex D from all lessors. 

     

 6.14  _Assumption of Indenture Obligation_. Following the Merger, Washington Mutual shall execute such supplemental indentures and provide such documents, including without limitation legal opinions, as are reasonably required upon a merger or consolidation of CCBI under the indentures, trust agreements, guarantee agreements and other agreements Previously Disclosed by CCBI or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 6.15  _Antitakeover Statutes_. Each of Washington Mutual and CCBI and their respective Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the Transaction.

 (c)  _Delay_. By Washington Mutual or CCBI, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by December 31, 2006, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be consummated by such date shall be due to (i) the failure of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the failure of any of the CCBI Shareholders (if CCBI is the party seeking to terminate) to perform or observe their respective covenants and agreements under the CCBI Shareholder Agreement.

 (e)  _No CCBI Stockholder Approval_. By either Washington Mutual or CCBI, if any approval of the stockholders of CCBI contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the CCBI Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

 (g)  _Certain Tender or Exchange Offers_. By Washington Mutual if a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of CCBI Common 

     

Stock is commenced (other than by Washington Mutual or a Subsidiary thereof),
and the CCBI Board recommends that the stockholders of CCBI tender their
shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that
such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten-
Business Day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

  

 8.02  _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except that (i) this Section 8.02, Section 6.06(d) and Article IX (except for Section 9.12) shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Washington Mutual or CCBI shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that CCBI shall pay Washington Mutual the sum of $40,000,000 (the "CCBI Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated as follows: 

  

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated by Washington Mutual pursuant to Section 8.01(f) or (g), CCBI shall pay the entire CCBI Termination Fee to Washington Mutual on the second Business Day following the termination of this Agreement; or 

  

 (ii) if (x) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Washington Mutual pursuant to Section 8.01(b), (B) by either Washington Mutual or CCBI pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and at the time of such termination no vote of the CCBI stockholders contemplated by this Agreement at the CCBI Meeting shall have occurred, or (C) by either Washington Mutual or CCBI pursuant to Section 8.01(e), and in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or made known to the senior management of CCBI or the CCBI Board (or any Person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, or reiterated a previously expressed plan or intention to make an Acquisition Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote of the stockholders of CCBI contemplated by this Agreement at the CCBI Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or the date of termination, in the case of clause (A) or (B), then (1) if within 15months after such termination CCBI enters into an agreement with respect to a Control Transaction, then CCBI shall pay to Washington Mutual an amount equal to $8,000,000 on the date of execution of such agreement and upon consummation of any such Control Transaction at any time thereafter, CCBI shall pay to Washington Mutual the remainder of the CCBI Termination Fee on the date of such consummation and (2) if a Control Transaction is consummated otherwise than pursuant to an agreement with CCBI within 15 months after such termination, then CCBI shall pay to Washington Mutual the CCBI Termination Fee (less any amount previously paid by CCBI pursuant to clause (1) above) on the date of such consummation of such Control Transaction. As used in this Section 8.02(b), a "Control Transaction" means (i) the acquisition by any Person whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any series of transactions, of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities of CCBI or CCB or a majority of the assets or CCBI or CCB, (ii) any issuance of securities resulting in the ownership by any Person of more than 50% of the voting power of CCBI or by any Person other than CCBI or its 

     

Subsidiaries of more than 50% of the voting power of CCB or (iii) any merger,
consolidation or other business combination transaction involving CCBI or any
of its Subsidiaries as a result of which the stockholders of CCBI cease to
own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the total voting power of the entity
surviving or resulting from such transaction.

  

Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Washington Mutual.

  

 (c) CCBI and Washington Mutual agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) above is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Washington Mutual would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement by CCBI. If CCBI fails to pay Washington Mutual the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified in such paragraph (b), CCBI shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Washington Mutual in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including without limitation any shareholder or former shareholder.

All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered, telecopied (with confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or delivered by an overnight courier (with confirmation) to such party at its address set forth below or such other address as such party may specify by notice to the parties hereto.

 9.07 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the CCBI Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding of the parties hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the CCBI Shareholder Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified PartiesÂ’ right to enforce Washington MutualÂ’s obligation under Section 6.10, which are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section 9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on CCBI or Washington Mutual, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this Agreement. 

  

 9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneysÂ’ fees or other costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations herein provided for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and costs incurred therein. 

  

 9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are 

     

used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first
above written (April 23, 2006). Whenever "to the knowledge of" or words of
similar import are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the
actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of the present officers with
titles of Executive Vice President or above of Washington Mutual or CCBI
respectively as applicable according to context.

  

 9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.12 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Washington Mutual may at any time modify the structure of the acquisition of CCBI set forth herein, including to provide for a merger of CCBI with and into Washington Mutual or another wholly owned Subsidiary of Washington Mutual, provided that (i) the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of CCBI Common Stock is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii) such modification will not adversely affect the tax treatment to CCBIÂ’s stockholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration and (iii) such modification will not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Governmental Authorities. In the event Washington Mutual elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. 

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed in counterparts by their duly authorized officers, all as of the day and year first above written.

ANNEX A

  

CCBI SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

  

 CCBI SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of April __, 2006, among __________________, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("CCBI"), Washington Mutual, Inc., a Washington corporation ("Washington Mutual"), and, solely for purposes of the last sentence of Section 9, CCBI. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below). 

  

 WHEREAS, CCBI and Washington Mutual are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which CCBI will merge with and into a subsidiary of Washington Mutual on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger") and, in connection therewith, outstanding shares of CCBI Common Stock will be converted into cash in the manner set forth therein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of CCBI Common Stock identified on Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all shares of CCBI Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, in order to induce Washington Mutual to enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such ShareholderÂ’s capacity as a shareholder of CCBI and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the stockholders of CCBI, or in connection with any written consent of the stockholders of CCBI, Shareholder shall: 

  

 (a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

  

 (b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (w) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (x) against any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of CCBI contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; (y) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the Merger or the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement; and (z) against the election of new members of CCBIÂ’s board of directors, other than the nominees of the majority of the board of directors in office on the date of this Agreement. 

     

 2. _Proxy_. Shareholder hereby irrevocably appoints as his, her or its proxy and attorney-in-fact, Todd H. Baker, Fay L. Chapman and Carey M. Brennan, in their respective capacities as officers of Washington Mutual, and any individual who shall hereafter succeed to any such officer of Washington Mutual, and any other Person designated in writing by Washington Mutual, each of them individually, with full power of substitution, to vote or execute written consents with respect to such ShareholderÂ’s Shares in accordance with Section 1 hereof during the term of this Agreement. This proxy is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable during the term of this Agreement, and Shareholder will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably requested by Washington Mutual to effectuate the intent of this proxy and hereby revokes any proxy, consent or power of attorney previously granted by such Shareholder with respect to the Shares. The foregoing proxy is subject to, and shall only become effective upon, Washington Mutual having received all necessary regulatory approvals and consents, if any, required under applicable law to exercise the voting powers granted by such proxy, as shall be determined by Washington Mutual in its judgment. Washington Mutual may terminate this proxy with respect to Shareholder and the Shares at any time at its sole election by written notice provided to such Shareholder. 

  

 3. _Transfer of Shares_. 

  

 (a) _Prohibition on Transfers of Shares; Other Actions_. Shareholder hereby agrees that while this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder shall not (i) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, distribute by gift or donation, or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Shares) or any interest therein, whether by actual disposition, physical settlement or effective economic disposition through hedging transactions, derivative instruments or other means, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person, or take any other action, that violates or conflicts with or could reasonably be expected to violate or conflict with ShareholderÂ’s representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) take any other action that could reasonably be expected to impair or otherwise adversely affect, in any material respect, ShareholderÂ’s power, authority and ability to comply with and perform his, her or its covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 3(a), Shareholder shall expressly be permitted to make cashless exercises of the Shares in accordance with any applicable CCBI Stock Option Plan as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Shareholder hereby agrees that Shareholder shall not deposit any Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy or enter into any voting agreement or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to any of the Shares. 

  

 4. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Washington Mutual as follows: 

  

 (a) _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights and to general equity principles. 

     

 (c) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder. 

  

  (d) _Ownership_. ShareholderÂ’s Shares are, and through
the term of this Agreement will be, owned beneficially and of record solely
by Shareholder except as otherwise disclosed on Exhibit I hereto. Shareholder
has good and marketable title to the Shares, free and clear of any lien,
pledge, mortgage, security interest or other encumbrance. As of the date
hereof, the Shares identified on Exhibit I hereto constitute all of the
shares of CCBI Common Stock owned beneficially or of record by Shareholder.
Shareholder has and will have at all times during the term of this Agreement
(i) sole voting power and sole power to issue instructions with respect to
the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof, (ii) sole power of disposition and
(iii) sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement,
in each case with respect to all of the Shares owned by Shareholder on the
date of this Agreement and all of the Shares hereafter acquired by
Shareholder and owned beneficially or of record by him, her or it during the
term of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "beneficial
ownership" shall be interpreted in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act, _provided_ that a Person shall be deemed to beneficially own
any securities which may be acquired by such Person pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion
rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of
whether the right to acquire such securities is exercisable immediately or
only after the passage of time, including the passage of time within 60 days,
the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any
combination of the foregoing).

  

 (e) _Consents and Approvals_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by him, her or it of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Shareholder to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority. 

  

 (f) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or affecting Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates before or by any Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Shareholder to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis. 

  

 5. _No Solicitation_. Shareholder hereby agrees that during the term of this Agreement he, she or it shall not, and shall not permit any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it to, directly or indirectly, (a) take any of the actions specified in clauses (i)-(vi) of Section 6.08 of the Merger Agreement, (b) agree to release, or release, any Person from any obligation under any existing standstill agreement or arrangement relating to CCBI, or (c) participate in, directly or indirectly, a "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC) or powers of attorney 

     

or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any Person with
respect to the voting of, any shares of CCBI Common Stock in connection with
any vote or other action on any matter of a type described in Section 1(b),
other than to recommend that stockholders of CCBI vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and as otherwise
expressly permitted by this Agreement. Shareholder agrees immediately to
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Persons other than
Washington Mutual with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal and will
take all necessary steps to inform any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by him, her or it of
the obligations undertaken by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 5. Nothing
contained in this Section 5 shall prevent a Shareholder who is an officer or
a member of the CCBI Board from discharging his or her fiduciary duties
solely in his or her capacity as such an officer or director.

  

 6. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions_. Shareholder hereby agrees to notify Washington Mutual promptly (and in any event within 2 Business Days) in writing of the number of any additional shares of CCBI Common Stock or other securities of CCBI of which Shareholder acquires beneficial or record ownership on or after the date hereof. Shareholder will comply with the provisions of Section 6.08(b) of the Merger Agreement as if he, she or it were CCBI. 

  

 7. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Washington Mutual if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Washington Mutual will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Washington Mutual may have an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with Washington MutualÂ’s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. 

  

 8. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. 

  

 (a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. 

  

 (b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date, if any, of termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (ii) the Effective Time of the Merger. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 

  

 9. _Stop Transfer Order_. In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby authorizes and instructs CCBI to instruct its transfer agent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of ShareholderÂ’s Shares for the period from the date hereof through the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8. CCBI agrees that as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement it shall give such stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the CCBI Common Stock. 

     

 10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

  

 11. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or like transmission and on the next Business Day when sent by a reputable overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

 (b) _Capacity_. The covenants contained herein shall apply to Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CCBI, and no covenant contained herein shall apply to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a director, officer or employee of CCBI or in any other capacity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of the Shareholder to comply with his or her fiduciary duties as a director, officer or employee of CCBI. 

  

 (c) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 (d) _Headings_. All Section headings herein are for convenience of reference only and are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or reference shall be derived therefrom. 

  

 (e) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  

 (i) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over the Litigation (as defined below) lies with the courts of the United States, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, for any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any court or before any Governmental Authority ("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, any claim that he, she or it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 12(e), that he, she or it or his, her or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 

     

any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any Litigation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 (ii) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at his, her or its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail. 

  

 (iii) Each of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waivers are intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America; provided that consent by the parties to jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 12(e) is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 12(e) and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose. 

  

 (f) _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 (g) _Change in Control Benefits_. Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that: Shareholder is not and shall not be entitled to receive any amount of payment or benefit that is in excess of the ShareholderÂ’s respective Change in Control Benefit as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule, and otherwise that the Change in Control Benefit (as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(viii) of the CCBI Disclosure Schedule) represents the maximum amount of payments and benefits which Shareholder has any right to receive, in each case in connection with a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement, other than the Merger Consideration Payment (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). In connection with the foregoing, Shareholder shall as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the day the Proxy Statement is mailed to stockholders of CCBI in accordance with Section 6.03(a) of the Merger Agreement, deliver an executed original copy of an acknowledgement and agreement that expressly provides for the foregoing, in a form to be provided by Washington Mutual as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, which form shall also include an acknowledgement and agreement by the Shareholder of a good faith estimate of the ShareholderÂ’s Gross-Up Payment (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). 

  

 13. _Attorney Â’s Fees_. The prevailing party or parties in any litigation, arbitration, mediation, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding ("Proceeding") relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement may recover from the unsuccessful party or parties all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including expert witness and other consultantsÂ’ fees and costs) relating to or arising out of (a) the Proceeding (whether or not the Proceeding proceeds to judgment), and (b) any post-judgment or post-award proceeding 

     

including, without limitation, one to enforce or collect any judgment or
award resulting from the Proceeding. All such judgments and awards shall
contain a specific provision for the recovery of all such subsequently
incurred costs, expenses, and fees and disbursements of counsel.

  

 14. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) In order that Washington Mutual may have and enjoy the full benefit of ownership of CCBI and the businesses it conducts following the Effective Time, Shareholder agrees that for a period of three years after the Effective Date, Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, either as principal, manager, agent, consultant, advisor, independent contractor, officer, stockholder, partner, investor, lender or employee or in any other similar capacity: 

  

 (i) carry on, engage in or have any financial interest (including without limitation any interest in the form of voting or nonvoting equity or debt securities, partnership interests or similar securities, or warrants or options thereon) in any Person that engages in, any Competitive Business, provided that Shareholder may acquire less than 5% of the equity of any Person so long as (A) the securities so acquired are either listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq or, if not so listed or quoted, Shareholder obtains prior approval for such acquisition from Washington Mutual (which prior approval will not be unreasonably withheld) and (B) such acquisition is and remains solely for investment purposes, or 

  

 (ii) hire, attempt to hire, contact or solicit with respect to hiring, any Person who is an employee of CCBI, or induce or otherwise counsel, advise or knowingly encourage any such Person to leave the employ of CCBI, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any Person whose employment with CCBI terminated more than six months prior to the time Shareholder first solicited such Person for employment following the Effective Date. 

  

For purposes of this Section 14, the term "Competitive Business" shall mean
the business of originating, purchasing, servicing or selling (whether as
broker or principal) multifamily loans or commercial real estate loans or
providing services in connection with property exchanges under Section 1031
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, anywhere in the State of
California.

  

 (b) Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the businesses conducted by CCBI are highly competitive and that the covenants made by Shareholder in this Section 14 are made in consideration of the payments of the Merger Consideration and as a necessary inducement for Washington Mutual to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. It is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions of this Section 14 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that, although Shareholder and Washington Mutual each consider the restrictions contained in this Section 14 to be reasonable, if a final determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 14 is unenforceable against any party, the provisions of this Section 14 shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. 

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first written above.

If the landlord named in the Lease is other than Landlord, Tenant has received notice of the assignment to Landlord of the landlordÂ’s interest in the Lease and Tenant recognizes Landlord as the landlord under the Lease. 

  

 4. No rent under the Lease has been paid more than one (1) month in advance, and no other sums or security deposits have been deposited with Landlord, except in the amount of $__________. (If none, state "NONE"). Tenant is not entitled to rent concessions or free rent.

 6. There exists no defense to, or right of offset against, enforcement of the Lease by Landlord. Neither Landlord nor Tenant is in default under the Lease and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, could result in such a default. 

  

 7. Tenant has not received any notice of any present violation of any federal, state, county or municipal laws, regulations, ordinances, orders or directives relating to the use or condition of the Premises.
