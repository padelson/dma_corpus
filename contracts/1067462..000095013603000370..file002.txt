surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than

Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable.

deliver to the Surviving Corporation any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.6 that remains
undistributed to holders of Company Shares, Company Series A Preferred Shares
and Company Series B Preferred Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time.
Holders of Certificates who have not complied with this Section 3.6 prior to the
demand by the Surviving Corporation shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration.

be liable to any Person in respect of any Company Shares, Company Series A
Preferred Shares or Company Series B Preferred Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     (g) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder to
any Person any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign income tax
Law and shall make any required filings with tax authorities with respect to
such withholding. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror
withholds those amounts, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Shares, Company
Series A Preferred Shares or Company Series B Preferred Shares in respect of
which deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Acquiror, as the case may be.

     (h) If any Certificate has been or is claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
that a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to that Certificate, the Exchange Agent

Certificate, the proper amount of the Merger Consideration.

Option or Company Option Plan and any such other stock option or compensation
plans or arrangements applicable to Company Options), necessary to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by Sections 3.7(a)-(c), inclusive.

     (e) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the
Effective Time, the Company's 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "COMPANY
PURCHASE PLAN") and the Company Option Plans shall be terminated. The Parent
shall receive from the Company evidence that the Company Purchase Plan and the
Company Option Plans have been terminated pursuant to a resolution of the
Company's Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolution shall be
subject to review and approval of the Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The rights of participants in the Company Purchase Plan
with respect to any offering period then underway under the Company Purchase
Plan, which commences prior to the Effective Time, shall be determined by
treating the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of
such offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such
shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for
all purchases under the Company Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of
the Company Purchase Plan and the terms of any offering period commencing prior
to the Effective Time) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 3.7(e).

     (f) At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock award for
Company Shares ("RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD") shall be canceled and in consideration
of such cancellation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a
canceled Restricted Stock



                                       15
<PAGE>

Award, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount per
Company Share subject to such canceled Restricted Stock Award equal to the
Common Merger Consideration.

     3.8. WARRANTS.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled and in consideration of such cancellation, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of a canceled Company Warrant, as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount per Company Share
subject to such canceled Company Warrant equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
Common Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per Company Share
subject to such canceled Company Warrant.

     (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding TOPR Warrant, whether or not
vested, shall remain outstanding pursuant to the terms of the TOPR Warrant
Agreement; provided, however that each such TOPR Warrant shall thereafter be
entitled, pursuant to Section 10.1 of the TOPR Warrant Agreement, to receive the
Common Merger Consideration, in lieu of Company Shares, in the manner and upon
the terms set forth in the TOPR Warrant Agreement.

     3.9. SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK PURCHASE AND LOAN PLAN. The Company agrees to
deliver, or cause the custodian designated by the Company with respect to the
Supplemental Stock Purchase and Loan Program (the "SSPLP") to deliver, the
Certificates held by the Company or such custodian to the Exchange Agent
promptly after receipt of a letter of transmittal and instructions from the
owners of the Common Shares represented by the Certificates and promptly after
receipt of the Common Merger Consideration with respect to the Common Shares
represented by such Certificates deliver such Common Merger Consideration to the
participants in the SSPLP, net of the outstanding principal and accrued and
unpaid interest with respect to the promissory notes for which such Certificates
were pledged under the SSPLP.

     3.10. DISSENTING SHARES.

     (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are held by Persons who shall have properly demanded in writing appraisal
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 (or any successor provision) of
the DGCL (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Common Merger Consideration as provided hereunder and shall
only be entitled to such rights and consideration as are granted by Section 262
(or any successor provision) of the DGCL. Such Persons shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by Persons who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such
shares under Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the Common Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.3 hereto as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such failure, withdrawal or loss, whichever occurs later.

     (b) The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments



                                       16
<PAGE>

served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal or the payment of the fair cash value of any such shares under the
DGCL. Other than pursuant to a court order, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or the payment of the fair cash value of any such shares
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

the Company, no such multiemployer plan is in reorganization or insolvent (as

Schedule, no Company Plan exists that, as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or

applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders, decrees, judgments, writs,
and regulations of any controlling governmental authority or instrumentality. No

Effect.

title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all their respective assets, except
for those which are no longer used or useful in the conduct of their businesses

these assets, other than assets in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens, except for (a)
Permitted Liens and (b) Liens that would not be reasonably likely to have,

Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld all amounts required by applicable Law
or by agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries and other payments to
Company Employees, and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries is or has been
liable for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any penalty for failure to

Effect. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is or has been liable for any
payment to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental Entity with respect to

a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws
concerning the classification of employees and independent contractors and have
properly classified all such persons for purposes of participation in the
Company Plans, except in the case that non-compliance would not be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

provided or made available to Parent copies of all written employment,
consulting, change of control, severance agreements or arrangements which have
been entered into between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one

such arrangement providing for compensation and benefits with a pre-tax value
that has not in the past exceeded and cannot reasonably be expected in the next

however, that any such arrangement providing for compensation and benefits with
a pre-tax value that has not in the past exceeded and cannot reasonably be

have been paid and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in all material
respects in compliance with the terms of such insurance.

     4.22. AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. Except (i) as expressly disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents, (ii) for any expense reimbursements and advances in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) for any
Participation Interests identified in the Summary of Grants, (iv) for any
employment or consulting agreement identified in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (v) for any benefits pursuant to a Company Plan, (vi) for transactions
with any non-employee member of the Company's Board of Directors or his or her

owner of five percent or more of any class or series of voting securities of the
Company or (z) Affiliate of any such officer, director, family member or

     4.23. REQUIRED VOTE; BOARD APPROVAL; STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES.

     (a) The only vote required of the holders of any class or series of the
Company's Equity Interests necessary to adopt this Agreement and to approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is the approval of a
majority of the outstanding Company Shares (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL").
For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
no vote of the holders of any other class or series of the Company's Equity
Interests is required under Article EIGHTH of the Company Charter to adopt this
Agreement and to approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

     (b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company's Board of Directors and
the Special Committee have (i) determined that this Agreement, the Voting
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Merger, are in the best interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders,
(ii) approved this Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
recommend to the Company Stockholders that they vote in favor of adopting and
approving this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof.
Such approvals by the Company's Board of Directors and the Special Committee are
sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the
Merger and any of such other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover



                                       33
<PAGE>

statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Voting Agreements or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and no provision of the Company Charter or the
Company's by-laws or similar governing or organizational instruments of any
Company Subsidiary would, directly or indirectly, restrict or impair the ability
of Parent to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with
respect to, shares of the Company and any Company Subsidiary that may be
acquired or controlled by Parent, as a result of the Merger or otherwise.

     4.24. INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED. The Proxy Statement will not contain, at
the time of the mailing thereof and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on
information supplied by Holding or its Affiliates in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

     4.25. NO KNOWLEDGE OF BREACH. The Company has no Knowledge as of the date
hereof (and without giving effect to Section 6.5) of any breaches of the
representations or warranties contained in Article 5 hereof such that the
condition in Section 9.2(a)(ii) would not be satisfied.

     4.26. DISCLAIMER OF OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Company does
not make, and has not made, any representations or warranties in connection with
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby other than those expressly
set forth herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Person has been
authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty relating to the

                                       34

where the failure to be qualified would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     5.2. CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by
each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are within the corporate powers of each of Holding, Parent

corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Holding,
Parent or Acquiror are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror and assuming that
this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Holding, Parent
and Acquiror, enforceable in accordance with its terms.

     5.3. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by

require any consent, approval, action, order, authorization, or permit of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity by Holding,
Parent or Acquiror other than (a) those set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of
Section 4.3 and (b) other consents, approvals, actions, orders, authorizations,

Agreement.

     5.4. NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and performance by Holding,
Parent and Acquiror of this Agreement and the consummation by Holding, Parent

by-laws of any of Holding, Parent or Acquiror, (b) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.3, contravene or conflict with, or constitute a
violation of, any provision of Law, binding upon or applicable to any of
Holding, Parent and Acquiror or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or affected, (c) constitute a breach or default under (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both could reasonably become a breach
or default) or give rise (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) to a
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration under any
agreement, contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
concession, franchise, joint venture, limited liability or partnership agreement
or other instrument binding upon, any of Holding, Parent or Acquiror or their
respective properties or assets, or (d) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien (except as contemplated by the Commitment Letter) on any asset of any
of Holding, Parent or Acquiror other than, in the case of clauses (b), (c) and
(d) taken together, any such items that would not be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     5.5. PARENT SEC DOCUMENTS.

     (a) Parent and Holding have filed all forms, reports, filings, registration
statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since
July 20, 2001.


                                       35
<PAGE>

     (b) As of its filing date, each Parent SEC Document complied as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be.

     (c) No Parent SEC Document filed since July 20, 2001 pursuant to the
Exchange Act contained, as of its filing date, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Parent SEC Document, as amended or supplemented,
if applicable, filed since July 20, 2001 pursuant to the Securities Act
contained, as of the date on which the document or amendment became effective,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

     (d) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of Parent and Holding included in the
Parent SEC Documents were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) throughout the periods involved, and each fairly
presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Holding, Parent and their consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations and changes in financial position for
the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of
any unaudited interim financial statements).

     (e) Section 5.5 of the Holding, Parent and Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations
of Holding and its Subsidiaries as of and for the 3-month period ended December
31, 2002 (the "MOST RECENT HOLDING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The financial
information included in the Most Recent Holding Financial Statements has been
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

     5.6. [RESERVED].

     5.7. FINANCING.

     (a) As of the date of this Agreement, Acquiror has received an executed
commitment letter dated as of February 17, 2003 (the "COMMITMENT LETTER") from
Credit Suisse First Boston ("CSFB"), pursuant to which CSFB has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Parent the
amount of financing set forth in the Commitment Letter (the "FINANCING"), to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby. A true and complete copy of the
Commitment Letter has been previously provided to the Company. Acquiror has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by such Commitment
letter to be paid as of the date hereof (and will duly pay any such fees that
become due after the date hereof). The Commitment Letter is valid and in full
force and effect, does not contain any material misrepresentation by Parent
(other than those resulting from inaccurate information provided by the Company)
and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
would constitute a breach thereunder on the part of Holding, Parent or Acquiror.
It is the good faith belief of Holding, Parent and Acquiror that the Financing
will be obtained.


                                       36
<PAGE>

     (b) Parent has entered into a subscription agreement dated as of February
17, 2003 (the "SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT") and a commitment letter dated as of
February 17, 2003 (the "BLUM STRATEGIC COMMITMENT LETTER") with certain existing
stockholders of Parent named therein (including Affiliates of Blum Capital
Partners, L.P.), pursuant to which such stockholders (or their assignees or
designees) have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide to Parent not less than $100 million and up to $145 million
of financing to complete the transactions contemplated hereby and satisfy the
financing conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (d) of the section of Exhibit
A of the Commitment Letter titled "Acquisition" (collectively, the "ADDITIONAL
FINANCING"). A true and complete copy of each of the Subscription Agreement and
the Blum Strategic Commitment Letter has been previously provided to the
Company. Each of the Subscription Agreement and the Blum Strategic Commitment
Letter is valid and in full force and effect and no event has occurred which
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach
thereunder on the part of Holding, Parent or Acquiror. It is the good faith
belief of Holding, Parent and Acquiror that the Additional Financing will be
obtained.

     (c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding Revolving
Loans (as defined in the Parent Credit Agreement) and approximately $1.3 million
of L/C Exposure (as defined in the Parent Credit Agreement) under the Parent
Credit Agreement.

     (d) Assuming that the information provided by the Company to Parent in
writing (including in electronic format) with respect to the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' historical costs is true and correct in all respects material to
this representation and warranty and was derived from the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the aggregate annualized cost savings relating
to ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its
Subsidiaries after giving effect to the Merger (as such amount is calculated for
purposes of Section 8 of Exhibit D to the Financial Commitment) would equal at
least the amount set forth in Section 5.7 of the Holding, Parent and Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule.

     5.8. INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED. The information supplied or to be supplied
by Holding, Parent and Acquiror in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
mailing thereof and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting (if any), not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Holding, Parent nor Acquiror
makes any representation or warranty with respect to any statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

     5.9. DISCLAIMER OF OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Holding, Parent
and Acquiror do not make, and have not made, any representations or warranties
in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby other
than those expressly set forth herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, no
Person has been authorized by Holding, Parent or Acquiror to make any
representation or warranty relating to Holding, Parent or Acquiror or their
respective businesses, or otherwise in connection with the Merger and the
transactions



                                       37
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby and, if made, such representation or warranty may not be
relied upon as having been authorized by Holding, Parent or Acquiror.

     5.10. NO KNOWLEDGE OF BREACH. Each of the Persons set forth on Section 5.10
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule has reviewed Article 4 of this Agreement and
the Company Disclosure Schedules (as delivered on the date hereof and without
giving effect to Section 6.5) and, based on such review, has no actual knowledge
as of the date hereof of any breaches of the representations or warranties
contained therein such that the condition in Section 9.3(a)(ii) would not be
satisfied.

                                   ARTICLE 6

business consistent with past practice; provided, further that the conduct of
business of Octane Ventures, LLC shall not be subject to the foregoing clauses
(a) through (s).

     6.2. STOCKHOLDER MEETING. Subject to Section 6.3 hereto, the Company shall
cause a meeting of its Stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER MEETING") to be
duly called and held as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to
Section 6.3 hereto, the Company's Board of Directors and the Special Committee
shall recommend approval and adoption by the Company Stockholders of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the
"COMPANY RECOMMENDATION"), and the Company shall take all other reasonable
lawful action to solicit and secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to
Section 6.3 hereto, the Company Recommendation, together with a copy of the
opinion referred to in Section 4.16(b), shall be included in the Proxy
Statement. Parent and Acquiror or their agents shall have the right to solicit
from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.3. ACQUISITION PROPOSALS; BOARD RECOMMENDATION.

     (a) The Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any Company
Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit any officer, director,
employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, directly or indirectly,
to (i) solicit, initiate or otherwise knowingly encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any
other action knowingly to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class or series of the Company's equity
securities to the extent such waiver or release would permit the other party or


                                       42
<PAGE>

parties to such agreement to actually acquire such securities or approve any
matter for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL with respect to any Third Party
(for the avoidance of doubt, a waiver or release under such agreement that
solely permits a proposal or offer, including, without limitation, an
Acquisition Proposal, would not violate this clause (iii)) or (iv) enter into
any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
if the Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party
that the Company's Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in
good faith is or could reasonably be expected to lead to the delivery of a
Superior Proposal from that Third Party, the Company may, subject to compliance
with all the other provisions of this Section 6.3, furnish information to and
engage in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party with respect to its
Acquisition Proposal ("PERMITTED ACTIONS") if and only to the extent that, the
Board of Directors or the Special Committee, by majority vote, concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside financial advisors and legal advisors,
that, as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, such Permitted Action is
necessary for the Board of Directors or the Special Committee to act in a manner
consistent with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee shall provide
Acquiror with prompt notice (but in no event later than the next day) of its
engaging in any Permitted Actions.

     (b) Except as permitted by this Section 6.3(b), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor the Special Committee or any other committee
thereof shall amend, withdraw, modify, change, condition or qualify in any
manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company Recommendation (it being understood and
agreed that a communication by the Board of Directors of the Company to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any
similar communication to the Company Stockholders in connection with the making
or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall not be deemed to constitute a
withdrawal, modification, amendment, condition or qualification of the Company
Recommendation for purposes of this Section 6.3). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee may withdraw or
modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Acquiror if (i) the
Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 6.3, (ii) the
Company shall have notified Parent at least two Business Days in advance of its
intention to effect such withdrawal or modification of the Company
Recommendation and (iii) the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, by
majority vote, concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
financial advisors and legal advisors, that such withdrawal or modification is
necessary for the Board of Directors or the Special Committee to act in a manner
consistent with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

     (c) Unless the Company's Board of Directors or the Special Committee has
previously withdrawn, or is concurrently therewith withdrawing, the Company
Recommendation in accordance with this Section 6.3, neither the Company's Board
of Directors nor the Special Committee or any other committee thereof shall
recommend any Acquisition Proposal to the Company Stockholders. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall (i) prevent
the Company's Board of Directors or the Special Committee from complying with
Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
making any disclosure required by applicable Law or (ii) prohibit accurate
disclosure of factual information regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company, or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal
has been made, the identity of the party



                                       43
<PAGE>

making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal to the extent such information, facts, identity or terms are required
to be disclosed under applicable Law.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company or the Special Committee may, in response to a Superior Proposal
that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.3, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1(c)(ii) and concurrently enter into an agreement regarding such Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii), and any purported termination pursuant to
Section 10.1(c)(ii) shall be void and of no force or effect (and the Company may
not enter into such agreement regarding such Superior Proposal), unless the
Company shall have complied in all material respects with all the provisions of
this Section 6.3, including the notification provisions in this Section 6.3, and
with all applicable requirements of Sections 10.2(b) (including the payment of
the Termination Fee (as defined in Section 10.2(b)) prior to or concurrently
with such termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal; and provided
further, however, that the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii) until after the second Business
Day following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR
PROPOSAL") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company or the Special Committee has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of
the Company or the Special Committee intends to exercise its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii) (it being understood and agreed
that, prior to any such termination taking effect, any amendment to the price or
any other material term of a Superior Proposal (such amended Superior Proposal,
a "MODIFIED SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal
and a new two Business Day period with respect to such Modified Superior
Proposal).

     (e) The Company shall notify Acquiror promptly (but in no event later than
the next Business Day) after receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal
or any request for information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any request for a
waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement by any Person that
has made, or informs the Board of Directors or the Special Committee of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary that it is considering making, an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that prior to participating in any discussions or
negotiations or furnishing any such information, the Company shall receive from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are not
materially less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of October 14, 2002 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), between Holding
and the Company. The notice shall indicate the material terms and conditions of
the proposal or request and the identity of the Person making it, and the
Company will promptly notify Acquiror of any material modification of or
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal (and the terms of such
modification or amendment); provided, however, that, without limiting what
changes may be material, any change in the form, amount, timing or other aspects
of the consideration to be paid with respect to the Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be a material modification or a material



                                       44
<PAGE>

amendment. The Company shall keep Acquiror informed, on a reasonably current
basis, of the status of any negotiations, discussions and documents with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal or request.

     (f) The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause any Person acting
on its behalf to cease, and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Third Party conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing and shall request any such parties in possession of confidential
information about the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was furnished by or
on behalf of the Company or any such Subsidiary to return or destroy all such
information in the possession of any such party or the agent or advisor of any
such party.

     6.4. FRENCH WARRANTS. The Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, exercise any call rights or other rights the Company or such Subsidiaries
have to purchase or acquire the outstanding Warrants (solely for purposes of
this Section 6.4, as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 30,
2001, among the Company, Insignia France SARL, Jean Claude Bourdais and the
other parties thereto) for cash or, solely to the extent payment in cash would
breach or violate the provisions of the Senior Credit Agreement, Company Shares.

     6.5. SUPPLEMENTAL COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. Subject to the provisions of
the following sentence, the Company shall have the right to make additions (each
such addition, a "SUPPLEMENTAL EXCEPTION") to the Company Disclosure Schedule by
delivering a single supplement thereto (the "SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"),
which Supplemental Disclosure Schedule must be delivered to Parent no later than
eleven (11) Business Days after the date hereof and may contain Supplemental
Exceptions solely with respect to the following provisions of Article 4 (it
being understood that any disclosure provided in the Supplemental Disclosure
Schedule will be deemed to apply solely to the following Sections of Article 4
(and not any other Sections of Article 4) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Supplemental Disclosure
Schedule): the second sentence of Section 4.1, Section 4.4(b), Section 4.4(c),
Section 4.6(a), Section 4.6(c), Section 4.7(f), Section 4.9, Section 4.11,
Section 4.12 (excluding the last sentence of Section 4.12(g)), Section 4.13,
Section 4.14, Section 4.15, Section 4.17, Section 4.18 (excluding the last
sentence of Section 4.18 (b)), Section 4.19, Section 4.20, Section 4.21 and
Section 4.22. With respect to the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule, (i) each
Supplemental Exception included in the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule must be
a fact, event, circumstance or other matter that existed as of the date hereof,
and the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule cannot include any facts, events,
circumstances or other matters arising only after the date of this Agreement,
(ii) each Supplemental Exception can refer only to specific facts, events,
circumstances or other matters (e.g. identification of a contract by date and
names of the parties thereto), and the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule cannot
include general statements or exceptions (e.g. references to general categories
of contracts), (iii) the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule cannot include any
agreement, contract or transaction to which any Person named in the definition
of "Knowledge" is a party and (iv) each Supplemental Disclosure must contain
only such information as the Company in good faith believes is required to be
included on the Company Disclosure Schedule. Copies of all documents referred to
in any Supplemental Disclosure Schedule must be made available to Parent on or
prior to the date of delivery of such Supplemental Disclosure Schedule. In
addition, the Company agrees to deliver promptly (but in no event later than two
Business Days after a request by Parent) to Parent all



                                       45
<PAGE>

information reasonably requested by Parent relating to any Supplemental
Exceptions disclosed in the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule. In the event the
Supplemental Exceptions included in the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, then Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Supplemental
Disclosure Schedule, or, if later, two (2) Business Days after receipt by Parent
of the documents and information referred to in the two immediately preceding
sentences but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule. All Supplemental Exceptions included in
the Supplemental Disclosure Schedule in accordance with this Section 6.5 will be
deemed to have been included in the Company Disclosure Schedule from and after
the date of this Agreement.

6.6. PRE-CLOSING TERMINATIONS. No later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date
Parent will deliver to the Company a list of all employees and independent
contractors that Parent wishes to have terminated prior to the Closing (the
"SECTION 6.6 LIST"). After the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions
precedent set forth in Article 9 but prior to the Closing, subject to compliance
with applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries
to, terminate (effective prior to the Closing) the employment or independent
contractor relations, as applicable, of all employees and independent
contractors listed on the Section 6.6 List.

                                   ARTICLE 7

                    COVENANTS OF HOLDING, PARENT AND ACQUIROR

     Each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror agrees as set forth below.

     7.1. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.

     (a) Holding, Parent, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation agree that the
Surviving Corporation shall adopt on or prior to the Effective Time, in its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the same indemnification, limitation
of or exculpation from liability and expense advancement provisions as those set
forth in the Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, in each case as
of the date of this Agreement, and that such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed, revoked or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years and one
(1) month after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or are otherwise entitled to the benefit of such provisions, unless
such modification is required after the Effective Time by applicable Law.

     (b) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, commencing at the
Effective Time and continuing for six (6) years (or for such longer period
provided for in any applicable statute of limitations) and one (1) month
thereafter, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, and if Parent and the
Surviving Corporation do not promptly do so, Holding shall, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary and their respective estates, heirs,

                                       46

<PAGE>

personal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any Claim (whether asserted prior to, at or after, the
Effective Time) arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their
capacity as director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
their serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as
director, officer, trustee, partner or fiduciary of another Person, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise in each case occurring on or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
provided, however, that in the event any Claim or Claims for indemnification are
made within such six-year (or within such longer period provided for in any
applicable statute of limitations) and one-month period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such Claim or Claims shall continue until the
final disposition of any and all such Claims. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event of any Claim, (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, and if
Parent and the Surviving Corporation do not promptly do so, Holding shall (x)
periodically advance reasonable fees and expenses (including attorneys fees)
with respect to the foregoing and pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by each Indemnified Party, promptly after statements therefor
are received, provided that the Indemnified Party to whom fees and expenses are
advanced or for which fees and expenses of counsel are paid provides an
undertaking to repay such advances and payments if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification, and (y)
vigorously assist each Indemnified Party in such defense, and (ii) subject to
the terms of this Section 7.1, Holding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate in the defense of any matter. If any Claim is commenced as to
which an Indemnified Party desires to receive indemnification, such Indemnified
Party shall notify the Surviving Corporation with reasonable promptness;
provided, however, that failure to give reasonably prompt notice to the
Surviving Corporation shall not affect the indemnification obligations of
Holding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation hereunder except to the extent that
the failure to so notify has prejudiced the Surviving Corporation in such Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain counsel of such Indemnified
Party's own choice to represent such person; and such counsel shall, to the
extent consistent with its professional responsibilities, cooperate with
Holding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and any counsel designated by any
of Holding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Holding, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable only for any settlement of any Claim
against an Indemnified Party made with Parent or the Surviving Corporation
written consent. Holding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not,
without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Party, settle or compromise
any Claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment in
respect thereof, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes, as an
unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant to such Indemnified Party
of an unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim.

     (c) For six (6) years and one (1) month from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Holding and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide to the present and former directors and officers of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary liability and fiduciary liability insurance
protection with the same coverage and in the same amount, and on terms no less
favorable to the directors and officers than that provided by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in effect on the date
hereof and listed on Section 7.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that the



                                       47
<PAGE>

Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make premium payments for such
insurance to the extent such annual premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance; and provided,
further, that if the premiums with respect to such insurance exceed 300% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain such insurance with the
maximum coverage as can be obtained at an annual premium equal to 300% of the
annual premiums paid by the Company as of the date hereof.

     (d) All rights to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses contained
in any agreement with any Indemnified Parties as in effect on the date hereof
with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated hereby) shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect.

     (e) This Section 7.1 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal representatives and shall
be binding on Holding, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors and assigns and the covenants and agreements contained herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

     (f) If Holding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Holding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1.

     (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its officers, directors or employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1 is not prior to
or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

     7.2. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

     (a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Holding and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to individuals who are employees of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who subsequently become employees of the Surviving Corporation (the "CONTINUING
EMPLOYEES"), with employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
equivalent to the employee benefits provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to
their own similarly situated current employees.

     (b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and the vesting
of benefits under plans maintained or contributed to by Holding, Parent or its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees and for each of the
Persons set forth in Section 7.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"PURCHASER PLANS"), including, but not limited to, any



                                       48
<PAGE>

pension, severance, 401(k), vacation and sick pay plan, and for purposes of
calculating benefits under any severance, sick leave or vacation plans, Holding,
Parent or its Subsidiaries shall give credit for years of service with the
Company, as if they were years of service with Holding, Parent or its
Subsidiaries. Holding, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall recognize such service
for purposes of satisfying any waiting period, evidence of insurability
requirements or the application of any preexisting condition limitation.
Holding, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall also give the Continuing Employees
and such Persons set forth in Section 7.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Company Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Holding, Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

     (c) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Date, the
Company shall terminate the Insignia Financial Group, Inc. 401(k) Retirement
Savings Plan and any other 401(k) plan(s) that Company or its Affiliates sponsor
for the benefit of Company Employees (the "COMPANY 401(K) PLANS"), subject to
and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, unless Parent
provides notice to the Company at least 15 days prior to the Effective Time that
the Company 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated. The Parent shall receive from
the Company evidence that the Company 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant
to a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors (the form and substance of
such resolution shall be subject to review and approval of the Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, as promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Parent
shall permit Continuing Employees to participate in a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan established or maintained by the Parent or its Affiliate (the
"PARENT 401(K) PLAN") and, to the extent permitted by the Parent 401(k) Plan, to
rollover (whether by direct or indirect rollover, as selected by such
participant) his or her "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined under
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plans. No loan shall be
placed into default or declared in default, and the Parent shall consider, in
good faith, permitting participants in the Company 401(k) Plans to transfer his
or her account balance under the Company 401(k) Plans, together with the
promissory note evidencing the plan loan and the applicable loan documentation,
to the Parent 401(k) Plan through a direct rollover. In such case, the loan
shall be assumed and continued by the Parent 401(k) Plan in a manner
substantially similar to the Company 401(k) Plans.

     7.3. CONDUCT OF HOLDING, PARENT AND ACQUIROR. Holding and Parent each will,
and will take all action necessary to cause Acquiror to, perform its obligations
under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     7.4. TRANSFER TAXES AND OTHER TAX MATTERS.

     (a) The parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding all
state, local and foreign real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees or similar Taxes ("TRANSFER TAXES") which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
are required to be filed on or before the Effective Time. All Transfer Taxes
(including any interest


                                       49
<PAGE>

or penalties with respect thereto) attributable to the Merger shall be timely
paid by Holding, Parent, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation.

     (b) Any liability arising out of New York State or New York City Real
Property Transfer Taxes with respect to interests in real property owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, if applicable and due in connection with the
Merger, shall be borne by Holding, Parent or the Surviving Corporation and
expressly shall not be a liability of the Company Stockholders.

     (c) If legislation is enacted prior to the Effective Time that the Company
and Parent in good faith mutually agree reduces or eliminates the federal income
tax on dividend income that would be payable by U.S. individuals as a result of
a cash dividend on the Common Shares, then the Company shall have the right to
declare a cash dividend on the Common Shares prior to the Effective Time if the
distribution of such dividend would result in tax savings to holders of the
Common Shares. If such a dividend is declared, the Common Merger Consideration
shall be reduced by the amount of such dividend per share. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no dividend shall be declared under this Section 7.4(c) if, in the
good faith judgment of Parent, the payment of the dividend and the related
reduction of the Common Merger Consideration increases the aggregate cost of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Acquiror or otherwise adversely
affects Acquiror or its direct or indirect stockholders.

     7.5. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

     (a) Holding and Parent each hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter and the Additional Financing on the terms set forth in the
Subscription Agreement and the Blum Strategic Commitment Letter. Holding and
Parent will keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to arrange the Financing and
the Additional Financing, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment
Letter, the Subscription Agreement or the Blum Strategic Commitment Letter
without the prior written consent of the Company. Holding and Parent will be
under no obligation under any circumstances to obtain more than $100.0 million
(plus the amount, if any, required by the Blum Strategic Commitment Letter) of
equity financing for the Merger and related matters. In the event that Holding
or Parent is unable to obtain the Financing or the Additional Financing, Holding
and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative
financing with overall pricing, cost, timing and maturity terms that are no less
favorable, and other terms that are no less favorable in any material respect,
to Holding and Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter or the
Subscription Agreement and Blum Strategic Commitment Letter, as the case may be.

     (b) Each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror agrees that it will not take any
action, and it will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, that
would violate clause (e) of the eighth paragraph of the Commitment Letter.


                                       50
<PAGE>

     7.6. CERTAIN EXISTING OBLIGATIONS.

     (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
the obligations of the Company under the employment agreements and
indemnification agreements listed in Section 7.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

     (b) Holding, Parent and Acquiror acknowledge that certain employees of and
consultants to (and former employees of and consultants to) the Company or one
or more of its Subsidiaries (and assignees of such employees and consultants)
(each, a "COVERED PARTICIPANT") (i) own direct Equity Interests in, or are
assignees of economic interests associated with direct Equity Interests in, the
Covered Entities (as defined below) and/or (ii) are the beneficiaries of
contractual grants pursuant to letter agreements of rights to certain proceeds
received by certain Subsidiaries of the Company that own direct or indirect
Equity Interests in or hold debt obligations of one or more Real Estate
Investment Entities (the interests of the Covered Participants described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) that exist as of the date of this Agreement, a
summary of which has been provided to Parent, as well as any such additional
interests that may be granted or issued as permitted by Section 6.1 of this
Agreement, are collectively referred to herein as "PARTICIPATION INTERESTS"). As
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but no later than
immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall, if and to the extent
applicable, cause the relevant governing and organizational documents of each
Relevant Subsidiary that is a Covered Entity to be amended to provide that,
effective upon the Closing: (x) the Relevant Subsidiary that is a Covered Entity
may not voluntarily sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any material assets
directly held by it (it being understood this will not restrict the sale or
other disposition of the underlying Real Estate Asset(s) held by the applicable
Real Estate Investment Entity, nor will it prevent the direct or indirect sale
of any Equity Interest in the Relevant Subsidiary that is a Covered Entity)
without the approval of at least one-third in interest of the Covered
Participants who directly or indirectly own Equity Interests in such Covered
Entity; and (y) such provisions may not be amended without the approval of at
least one-third in interest of the Covered Participants who own Equity Interests
in such Relevant Subsidiary that is a Covered Entity. In addition, Holding,
Parent and Acquirer hereby expressly acknowledge the validity and existence of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with respect
to the Participation Interests, and agree to cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (or any successor thereto that is a Subsidiary of Holding,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation) to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to provide for the Participation Interests to be cashed out only when the
underlying Real Estate Asset(s) are sold (rather than on a sale by the Company
or its Subsidiary of its interest in a Real Estate Investment Entity or a
Relevant Subsidiary). The holders of Participation Interests are express,
intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.6(b). "COVERED ENTITY"
means any Subsidiary of the Company (i) that owns a direct or indirect Equity
Interest in or holds a debt obligation of a Real Estate Investment Entity, and
(ii) in which one or more employees of or consultants to (or former employees of
or consultants to) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or an assignee of any
such employee or consultant) holds an Equity Interest (either directly or
pursuant to an assignment of an economic interest by a direct holder of an
Equity Interest in such Subsidiary), and (iii) in which the direct or indirect
holders of Equity Interests do not include any Person other than (x) the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company or (y) an employee of or consultant to (or former
employee of or consultant to) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or an
assignee of any such employee or consultant).

             COVENANTS OF HOLDING, PARENT, ACQUIROR AND THE COMPANY

     The parties hereto agree as set forth below.

     8.1. EFFORTS AND ASSISTANCE.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to
file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including, without limitation, obtaining all necessary consents, waivers,
approvals, estoppels, authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental
Entities or other Third Parties. The Company, Holding, Parent and Acquiror shall
furnish all information required to be included in any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Holding, Parent, Acquiror and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance and comment thereon, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to the other and each of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger.

     (b) Each of the Company, Holding and Parent shall make, and shall cause
their respective ultimate parents, if any, to make, an appropriate filing of a
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby promptly and shall promptly respond to any
request for additional information pursuant to the HSR Act and supply such
information. In addition, the Company, Holding and Parent shall each promptly
make any other filing that is required under any Non-U.S. Competition Law and
shall promptly respond to any request for additional information pursuant to
such Non-U.S. Competition Law and supply such information. Holding, Parent,
Acquiror and the Company shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger under any antitrust, trade, competition or takeover Laws
of any Governmental Entity, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall agree to do any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clause without
the prior written consent of Acquiror. Holding, Parent and Acquiror shall
reasonably consult with the Company and, subject to being permitted to do so by
the Governmental Entity, the Company shall have the right to attend and
participate in any telephone calls or meetings that Holding, Parent or Acquiror
has with any Governmental Entity with regard to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     (c) The Company shall provide, and will cause each Company Subsidiary and
their respective officers and employees to provide, all commercially reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement and obtaining of the Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including, without limitation,
facilitating customary due diligence and arranging senior officers, as selected
by Parent, assisting in the preparation of ratings agency presentations,
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and similar documents,



                                       52

presentations, executing and delivering commitment and financing letters,
underwriting, purchase or placement agreements, pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing documents, or other requested certificates or
documents and comfort letters and consents of accountants as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, provided, however that in no event will the Company or any
Company Subsidiary be required to enter into any agreement relating to such
Financing that could impose any liability on the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to the Closing. In addition, in conjunction with the obtaining
of the Financing, the Company agrees, at the reasonable request of Parent or
Acquiror, to call conditionally for prepayment or redemption, or to prepay,
redeem and/or renegotiate, as the case may be, any then existing indebtedness of
the Company; provided, however that no such prepayment or redemption shall
themselves actually be made until contemporaneously with or after the Closing.

     (d) Each of Holding, Parent, Acquiror and the Company shall use its best
efforts to obtain the consents, approvals, actions, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations, announcements and filings set forth on Section
8.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     8.2. PROXY STATEMENT. As soon as practicable and in any event no later than
30 days after execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file
the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC.
Holding, Parent, Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall notify Acquiror of the
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall provide to Acquiror promptly copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any representative of the Company and the
SEC. The Company shall give Acquiror and its counsel the opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement and any other documents filed with the SEC or
mailed to the Company Stockholders prior to their being filed with, or sent to,
the SEC or mailed to its Stockholders and shall give Acquiror and its counsel
the opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and supplements to the
Proxy Statement and any other documents filed with, or sent to, the SEC or
mailed to the Company Stockholders and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to,
the SEC or mailed to its Stockholders. Each of the Company, Holding, Parent and
Acquiror agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation
with the other parties hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC. As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement has
been cleared by the SEC, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to the
Stockholders. Each of the Company, Holding, Parent and Acquiror promptly shall
correct any information provided by it and used in the Proxy Statement that
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
shall take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement as to correct the same and to
cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law.

     8.3. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. On the date of the signing of this Agreement,
the parties shall issue a joint press release substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B. The


                                       53

parties shall cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of,
and consult with each other before issuing, any other press release or making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other parties (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by applicable
Law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

     8.4. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.

     (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to applicable
Law, the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall, upon reasonable advance
notice, (i) give to Parent and Acquiror, their counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to its offices,
properties, books and records; (ii) furnish or make available to Parent and
Acquiror, their counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized

Persons may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate
with the reasonable requests of Parent and Acquiror in connection with such
matters. Any access pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in a manner
which will not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be in accordance with any other existing
agreements or obligations binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Unless otherwise required by Law or as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each of Parent and Acquiror will hold, and will cause its respective officers,
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to hold any nonpublic information obtained in any investigation
in confidence in accordance with and agrees to be bound by, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that Parent and Acquiror will have the right
to provide all such information to any potential purchaser in connection with a
Real Estate Asset Sale and such potential purchaser's officers, employees,
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives as
long as such persons agree to keep such information confidential and agree not
to hire or solicit the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each
case in writing reasonably satisfactory to the Company. No access pursuant to
this Section 8.4(a) shall affect any representations or warranties of the
parties herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto. From
the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with reasonable access,
upon reasonable prior notice to Adam Gilbert, the General Counsel of the Company
or any Person designated by him to receive such notices, to employees and
consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of enabling
Parent or its Subsidiaries to meet with and make offers of employment or service
to one or more of said individuals and to discuss integration and other
transition matters with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however that the Company shall have the right to have a representative
attend each such meeting.

     (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquiror, and Parent
and Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would
reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;
(ii) any failure of the Company or Parent and Acquiror, as the case may be, to
materially comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or



                                       54
<PAGE>

nonoccurrence of any event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would
reasonably be expected to cause the failure by such party to materially comply
with or satisfy , any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; (iii) any notice or other communication from any
Third Party alleging that the consent of such Third Party is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) the
occurrence of any event, development or circumstance which has had or would be
reasonably likely to result in a Company or Parent Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.4(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect (x) the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or (y) the remedies available
hereunder to the party giving or receiving such notice.

     8.5. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and otherwise
to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations
under this Agreement. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
will not intentionally amend or waive any term or rights it has under the
consent letter received from the holder of the Company Preferred Shares. At and
after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or Acquiror, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Acquiror, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger.

     8.6. DISPOSITION OF LITIGATION. The Company will consult with Parent with
respect to any action by any Third Party to restrain or prohibit or otherwise
oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Voting Agreement and, subject to Section 6.3, will resist any such effort to
restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement. Parent may participate
in (but not control) the defense of any stockholder litigation against the
Company and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Voting Agreement at Parent's sole cost and expense. In
addition, subject to Section 6.3, the Company will not voluntarily cooperate
with any Third Party which has sought or may hereafter seek to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement and will cooperate with Parent to
resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Voting Agreement.

     8.7. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NO-RAID AGREEMENTS. Subject to Section 10.2(c)
hereto, the parties acknowledge that the Company and Holding entered into the
Confidentiality Agreement and the No-Raid Agreement, which agreements shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the expiration of each such
agreement according to its terms. Subject to Section 6.3 hereto, without



                                       55
<PAGE>

the prior written consent of Acquiror, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary will waive or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or
similar agreement which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has entered into
in connection with any completed or proposed business combination relating to
the Company or such Company Subsidiary.

     8.8. RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Acquiror evidence
satisfactory to Acquiror of the resignation of all directors of the Company,
effective at the Effective Time.

     8.9. SALES OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ASSETS.

     (a) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Company
will have the right, but not the obligation, to market for sale to third parties
at or prior to the Closing any or all of the Real Estate Investment Assets. To
the extent the Company engages in any such marketing and sales activities, the
Board of Directors of the Company will instruct the current President of
Insignia Financial Services, Inc. ("IFS") to keep (and to instruct his direct
and indirect reports to keep) Parent reasonably informed of such marketing and
sale activities (including, without limitation, providing a telephonic update at
least once per week regarding such activities), to provide Parent with a
reasonable advance review of any agreements regarding the sale of Real Estate
Investment Assets (it being understood that such review shall not obligate the
Company to accept any comments of Parent with respect to such agreements) and to
consider in good faith the views of Parent (it being understood that the
obligations under this Section 8.9(a) are limited to requiring the Company's
Board of Directors to provide such instruction and do not impose any obligations
on the Company as with respect to the current President of IFS or his report(s)
or the consequences of their actions or inactions).

     (b) Holding shall have the right to require that, after the satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 but at or immediately
prior to the Closing, all or any of the Real Estate Investment Assets that have
not been sold prior to the Closing Date to be sold and transferred to Holding or
one or more of its Subsidiaries for such consideration and in such terms as
Holding shall determine, provided that in no event shall any such terms or
conditions have any force or effect until immediately prior to the Closing, and
provided, further that this Section 8.9(b) shall not obligate the Company or its
Subsidiaries to obtain any third party or governmental approval and such sale
and transfer shall not be required if the sale or transfer could cause a failure
of a condition precedent to this Agreement or if it would violate applicable
Law.

     (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company (or its appropriate Subsidiaries)
will enter into a definitive agreement to sell on or after the Closing Date the
investment set forth in Section 8.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to a
Third Party on such terms as the Company shall be able to sell it, provided that
prior to entering into any such agreement the Company will provide Parent with a
copy of all agreements relating to such sale and Parent will have two Business
Days to approve or reject such terms in writing and provided, further that the
Closing may be a condition precedent to the closing of any such agreement. If
Parent rejects such terms in writing, then the Company will not enter into such
Agreement and all obligations of the Company under this Section 8.9(c) will
immediately terminate. The parties acknowledge that the closing of any such sale
shall be subject to certain governmental approvals.

     8.10. TREATMENT OF NET PROCEEDS. In the event the amount of Net Proceeds
Deemed Received by the Company exceeds the Threshold Amount (which Net Proceeds,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any contingent rights to future
cash payments or any amounts of cash held in escrow) (the amount of Net Proceeds
in excess of the Threshold Amount is referred to herein as the "EXCESS NET
PROCEEDS AMOUNT"), each of Holding, Parent, Acquiror and the Company shall
increase the Common Merger Consideration such that the additional amounts
payable to holders of the Company Shares pursuant to Section 3.3 hereto
(assuming (a) no Common Shares are held by any of Holding, Parent, Acquiror or
any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and (b) no Dissenting Shares), holders of
Company Options pursuant to Section 3.7 hereto (assuming all Company Options are
terminated thereunder) and holders of Company Warrants (assuming all Company
Warrants are canceled thereunder), in the aggregate, shall equal the Excess Net
Proceeds Amount; provided, however that in no event shall the Common Merger
Consideration exceed $12.00 per share, subject to adjustment as contemplated by
Section 7.4(c). Each of Holding, Parent and Acquiror agree to take all necessary
actions to effect the provisions of the immediately foregoing sentence, if
applicable.

     8.11. 401(K) RESTORATION PLAN. The Company shall, and Holding and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each participant in the
Company's 401(k) Restoration Plan (the "RESTORATION PLAN") whose employment with
the Company terminates the amount owing to him under the Restoration Plan as of
the date of termination. Such payment shall be made in accordance with the terms
of the Restoration Plan.

          (i) if a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect any
     representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Holding,

     not to be satisfied, and such condition shall be incapable of being
     satisfied by the End Date; or

          (ii) as contemplated by Section 6.3(d), provided, however that

     10.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

     (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 (except as
provided in Section 10.2(b) and Section 10.2(c)), there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Holding, Parent, Acquiror, the Company or any of their
respective officers, directors, stockholders, agents or Affiliates, except no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement; provided that the
provisions of Sections 8.3, 8.7, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and Article 11 of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.

     (b) In the event that:

          (i) this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to Section
     10.1(d)(ii)(A)(1) (but only if, prior to the time the Board of Directors,
     Special Committee or other committee amended, withdrew, modified, changed,
     conditioned or qualified the Company Recommendation, the Company had
     received or there had been any public announcement or disclosure of an
     Acquisition Proposal), Section 10.1(d)(ii)(A)(2), (3) or (4), Section
     10.1(d)(ii)(B), or Section 10.1(d)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent
     (in immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent) on the
     next Business Day following such termination a cash amount equal to the
     $7,000,000 (the "TERMINATION FEE");

          (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
     10.1(c)(ii), then simultaneous with such termination, the Company shall pay
     to Acquiror (in immediately available funds to an account designated by
     Parent) a cash amount equal to the Termination Fee; or

          (iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i)
     (provided that at the time of such termination pursuant to Section
     10.1(b)(i), the condition precedent in Section 9.1(b) shall have been
     satisfied and the reason for the Closing not having previously occurred
     shall not be the failure to satisfy the condition precedent set forth in
     Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(c)), Section 10.1(b)(iii) or Section
     10.1(d)(i) (but only if such termination pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i)
     relates to the breach of or failure to perform in any material respect a
     covenant or agreement of the Company), (B) an Acquisition Proposal (with
     all percentages included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
     increased to 30% for purposes of this definition) has been made prior to
     such termination and (C) a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition
     Proposal (with all percentages included in the definition of Acquisition
     Proposal increased to 30% for purposes of this definition) is completed or
     a definitive agreement is executed by the parties thereto with respect to
     an Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages included in the definition of
     Acquisition Proposal increased to 30% for purposes of this definition)
     within twelve (12) months from the date this Agreement is terminated, the
     Company shall pay to Parent (in immediately available funds to an account
     designated by Parent) on the next Business Day following the earlier of the
     closing of the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal or the
     Company entering into a definitive agreement contemplating such Acquisition
     Proposal, a cash amount equal to the Termination Fee. Subject to Section
     11.8, in the event that the Termination Fee is paid pursuant to this


                                       61
<PAGE>

     Section 10.2(b)(iii), such payment will constitute liquidated damages and
     be in lieu of all other damages otherwise receivable by Holding, Parent or
     Acquiror and, upon receipt, will be the sole and exclusive remedy for the
     matters giving rise thereto.

     (c) If and only if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1(c)(i) or 10.1(b)(i) (but, in the case of Section 10.1(b)(i), only if the
sole reason(s) for termination is the failure of a condition precedent set forth
in Section 9.1(b) and/or 9.3(c)), the parties acknowledge and agree that,
effective immediately upon such termination, the No-Raid Agreement shall be
amended and restated in its entirety, without any action by the parties thereto,
to read as set forth in Section 10.2(c) of the Holding, Parent and Acquiror
Disclosure Schedule.

     (d) If and only if all of the conditions precedent in Article 9 have been
satisfied other than those in Section 9.3(c) and the sole reason for the failure
of such condition precedent is the breach of the Subscription Agreement and/or
the Blum Strategic Commitment Letter by the Investors (as defined therein),
Holding hereby assigns to the Company, effective as of such time, all of its
rights to enforce the Subscription Agreement and the Blum Strategic Commitment
Letter.

     10.3. FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated.

     10.4. INDEMNIFICATION.

     (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time (i) pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) or (ii) pursuant to Section
10.1(a) or 10.1(b)(i) due solely to the failure of the condition(s) set forth in
Section 9.1(b) and/or or 9.3(c) to be satisfied (in case of a termination under
either Section 10.1(a) or 10.1(b)(i)), then Parent, Holdings and Acquiror shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, "COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and against any and
all damages incurred by any Company Indemnified Party (hereinafter "COMPANY
LOSSES"), which are caused by (1) the termination or delivery of notice of
termination, during the Covered Period (as defined below), by any person that is
a commercial real estate services broker or independent contractor of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of February 7, 2003 of his or her employment or
independent contractor relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries or (2)
the termination or substantial diminution, or notice thereof during the Covered
Period, by any Person that is a client of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
February 7, 2003 of its commercial real estate services client relationship with
the Company or its Subsidiaries, including early termination of third-party
management, tenant representation and/or brokerage contracts, in each case under
clause (1) and clause (2) if (and only if) such termination or substantial
diminution (x) results from the announcement of discussions among the parties
hereto regarding the transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) does not result
from the Company's breach of this Agreement, provided that the maximum aggregate
amount of Company Losses for which the Company Indemnified Parties may be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.4 is $50,000,000 and none of Parent,
Holdings or Acquiror will be liable for any Company Losses in excess of such
$50,000,000. For the



                                       62
<PAGE>

avoidance of doubt, "Company Losses" shall not include any matters arising out
of or resulting from (x) conditions generally affecting the business or industry
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries operate, (y) U.S., U.K., French
or global general economic or political conditions or financial markets in
general or (z) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities (including, without
limitation, any declaration of war by the U.S. Congress) or acts of terrorism.
Company Losses shall not include any reduction in market price or value of the
Company Shares or any other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
nor shall any such reduction in market price or value be used as evidence of, or
otherwise be deemed relevant to, the determination of any amount of damages
incurred. The amount of Company Losses as a result of an event specified in
clause (1) will be the cost (including any signing bonus) of replacing the
relevant broker or independent contractor with a comparable broker or
independent contractor plus the lost profits of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as a result of any lost revenue. "COVERED PERIOD" means the period from February
7, 2003 through the date this Agreement is terminated (it being understood that
the period for which damages may arise is not limited to the Covered Period).

     (b) Subject to Section 10.2(c) and Section 11.8, the indemnity provided in
this Section 10.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
Indemnified Parties against Parent, Holdings or Acquiror at law or equity for
any matter covered by Section 10.4(a).

Articles 2, 3, 7, and 11 and in Section 8.7 shall survive the Effective Time.

     11.3. AMENDMENTS; NO WAIVERS.

     (a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time, if, and only if, the amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, a member of the Special
Committee on behalf of the Special Committee, Parent and Acquiror or in the case

<PAGE>

of such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto. No

or waiver on any occasion other than the one on which such extension or waiver
was granted or as an extension or waiver with respect to any provision of this
Agreement not expressly identified in such extension or waiver on the same or
any other occasion. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise

remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.

     11.4. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, that all or any of the rights or
obligations of Parent or Acquiror may be assigned to any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of such party (which assignment shall not relieve such
assigning party of its obligations hereunder); provided, further, that other
than with respect to the foregoing proviso, no party may assign, delegate or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in violation
hereof shall be null and void.

     11.5. COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party
hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other
parties hereto. Except as set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.6, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

     11.6. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed and fully performed within the state of Delaware.

     11.7. JURISDICTION. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or, if
such court does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of such proceeding
or if such jurisdiction is not available, in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, County of New Castle, and each of the parties hereby consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or proceeding in any of
those courts or that any suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any of
those courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any of the named courts. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on it by notice as
provided in Section 11.1 shall be deemed effective service of process.


                                       65
<PAGE>

     11.8. ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

     11.9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (together with the exhibits and
schedules hereto), the Voting Agreements, the No-Raid Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

     11.10. AUTHORSHIP. The parties agree that the terms and language of this
Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and, as a result,
there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be
resolved against any party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement
shall be decided without regard to events of authorship.

     11.11. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

     11.12. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

     11.13. HEADINGS; CONSTRUCTION. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement (a) words denoting the
singular include the plural and vice versa, (b) "it" or "its" or words denoting
any gender include all genders, (c) the word "including" shall mean "including
without limitation," whether or not expressed, (d) any reference herein to a

and (e) when calculating the period of time within or following which any act is
to be done or steps taken, the date which is the reference day in calculating
such period shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a
Business Day, then the period shall end on the next day which is a Business Day.
