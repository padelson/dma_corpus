iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 30,
2007, is entered into between Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Parent"), and Community Banks, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company"). Parent and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations." 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein in which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into Parent;

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Susquehanna Bank PA, a bank and trust company organized under
the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(the "Parent Bank"), and Community Banks, a bank organized under the
Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(the "Company Bank"), will enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Bank Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company Bank shall merge with
and into the Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger"), with the Parent
Bank constituting the surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank"), and it is
intended that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately following the
consummation of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL"), at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge
with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease.



 

1 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of
merger complying with the PBCL (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
prepared, executed and delivered for filing with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Department"), in each case on the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 10.1 hereof). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are filed by the Department
or at such later time as may be specified in the Articles of Merger (such time
being the "Effective Time"). 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL.

1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I,
and Sections 2.2(e) and Section 9.1(g) hereof, each share of the common stock,
$5.00 par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except for Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section 1.4(d)
hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to
the provisions of Section 1.5, either (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration
(as defined below) or (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as
defined below). The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."

For purposes of this Agreement:

"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the
Exchange Ratio.

"Per Share Cash Consideration" shall mean $34.00.

"Exchange Ratio" shall mean 1.48.

"Total Cash Amount" shall equal the product of the Per Share Cash
Consideration multiplied by 10% of the sum of (i) the shares of Company Common
Stock (excluding shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury) and (ii)
the Company Options (as defined in Section 1.6(a)), in each case outstanding
as of the close of business on the Determination Date.

"Determination Date" shall mean the third calendar day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a trading day on the NASDAQ
Stock Market, then the trading day immediately preceding such calendar day.



 

2 (b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate or direct registration statement (each a "Certificate")
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b) hereof, and (iii) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, proportionate
adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock Consideration.

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock (x) held
directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or
otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties (any
such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares") and (y) held by Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such shares of Company Common Stock, and shares of
Parent Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or
indirectly by Parent or the Company, being referred to herein as "DPC
Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of Parent,
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All
shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become
treasury stock of Parent.

(e) The calculations required by Section 1.4(a) shall be prepared jointly by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing Date.

1.5 _Election Procedures_. 

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent (as defined below)) in such form as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed 35 days prior to
the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as the Company and Parent
shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day
prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").



 

3 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock
Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common
Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration ("Cash Election Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no
election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock ("No Election
Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent
has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before
5:00 p.m., on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline")
shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form
Record Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the
Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the
certificates representing such Company Common Stock to be promptly returned
without charge to the person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects
in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent as
to such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.

(e) Within ten business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the
holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or
cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



 

4 (1) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the sum of the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of
the Cash Election Shares plus the aggregate amount of Option Cancellation
Payments under Section 1.6(a) or any other provisions of this Agreement (such
sum hereinafter, the "Section 1.5(e) Cash Amount") is greater than the Total
Cash Amount, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares
("Stock Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be
paid in the Merger (including, without limitation, any cash paid for Option
Cancellation Payments under Section 1.6(a) or any other provision of this
Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, and 

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(2) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

 

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process (excluding, to the extent possible, shares of Company
Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any incentive stock option at
any time within twelve months prior to the Effective Date), a sufficient
number of shares ("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash
amount that will be paid in the Merger (including, without limitation, any
cash paid for Option Cancellation Payments under Section 1.6(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash
Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and



 

5 (C) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

(3) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to
the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above shall not apply
and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Company.

1.6 _Option Plans; Stock Options_.

(a) Each holder of a Company stock option, whether vested or unvested, shall
have the opportunity (but not the obligation) to require the Company,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to cancel such stock option in
exchange for the payment of an appropriate cancellation payment. To facilitate
the foregoing, an option cancellation agreement (and other appropriate and
customary information and transmittal materials) in such form as Parent and
the Company shall mutually agree (an "Option Cancellation Agreement") shall be
mailed on the Mailing Date to each holder of an outstanding unexercised stock
option (whether vested or unvested) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the Companys 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2000 Directors Stock
Option Plan, Community Banks, Inc. Substitute PennRock Financial Services
Corp. Stock Incentive Plan of 2002, and Community Banks, Inc. Substitute
PennRock Financial Services Corp. Omnibus Stock Plan (collectively, the
"Company Option Plans," and such options being each a "Company Option"). The
Option Cancellation Agreements shall provide that, upon execution by the
holder of such Company Option and delivery of such Option Cancellation
Agreement to the Company in accordance with the provisions set forth herein,
such Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, and the holder of such Company Option, in cancellation and
settlement therefor, shall be entitled to a payment in cash, at the Effective
Time, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share
Cash Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Common Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Common Option immediately
prior to its cancellation (each such payment, net of the withholding of any
Taxes, and without interest, an "Option Cancellation Payment"). Option
Cancellation Agreements shall be effective only if received by the Company on
or prior to the 33rd day after the Mailing Date. The Board of Directors of
the Company shall adopt all appropriate resolutions and take all other actions
necessary with respect to Company Options subject to an Option Cancellation
Agreement, to terminate the relevant individual option agreements and cancel
the relevant Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time as
necessary to effectuate the provisions in this Section 1.6(a).



 

6 (b) At the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Option that is not subject
to an effective Option Cancellation Agreement, and each Company Option Plan,
shall be assumed by Parent in a transaction described in Sections 409A or
424(a), as applicable, of the Code. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that all Company Options shall become fully vested immediately prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 1.6(d)), except that (i)
each Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deliver to the holders of Company Options, notices
describing the conversion of such Company Options (as modified by this Section
1.6(b)), and the agreements evidencing the Company Options shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (as modified by this Section 1.6(b)).
Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Company Options. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parents obligations under this
Section 1.6(b). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) such cash as shall be necessary to pay
the Per Share Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4 and 2.2(a)
hereof, and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid in  



 

8  accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof. Such cash and certificates for shares
of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who
theretofore has not submitted such holders Certificate or Certificates with
a properly completed Election Form, a form letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The Company shall
have the right to review both the letter of transmittal and the instructions
prior to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments thereon. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.5 and upon
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter of transmittal
or Election Form, as the case may be, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder of Company Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant
to the provisions of Article I hereof and/or (y) a check representing the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and/or the amount of cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of Article I, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per
Share Cash Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



 

9 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or both, as
provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would
be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in
cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices of
Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market as reported by The Wall Street
Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional
shares and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

delivered to Parent, and Parent has delivered to the Company, a schedule (in
the case of the Company, the "Company Disclosure Schedule," and in the case of
Parent, the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things,
items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response
to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Article III, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a financial holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC
Act"). The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, copies of
which have previously been made available to Parent, are true and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As
used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with
respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of
such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any such effect
attributable to or resulting from (v) any change in banking or similar laws,
rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by
courts or governmental authorities, (w) any change in GAAP or
regulatory accounting principles applicable to banks, thrifts or their
holding companies generally, (x) changes attributable to or resulting from
changes in general economic conditions, including changes in the prevailing
level of interest rates, (y) any action or omission of the Company or Parent
or any Subsidiary of either of them taken in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or with the prior written consent of the other party hereto, or (z)
any expenses incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) the ability of such party and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due. Each of the Companys other Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has the
corporate (or equivalent) power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or the location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on such
Subsidiary. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
word "Subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any corporation,
limited liability company, partnership or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes.

(c) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries contain true
and correct records of all meetings and other corporate (or equivalent)
actions held or taken since January 1, 2004 through March 31, 2007 of their
respective shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be, and Boards
of Directors or similar governing authority (including committees thereof).

4.2 _Capitalization_. (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common

2007. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are  



 

12  fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except as referred to above
or reflected in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company does not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
other equity security of the Company or any securities representing the right

other equity security of the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, the
names of the optionees, the date of each option to purchase Company Common
Stock granted, the number of shares subject to each such option, and the price
at which each such option may be exercised under the Company Option Plans are
set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each Company
Option has been granted with an exercise price of not less than fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the date such Company Option
was granted; provided, however, that the exercise prices of the Company
Options issued in connection with the July 1, 2005 merger of PennRock
Financial Services Corp. were based, in part, on the merger consideration paid
in such merger, and were determined in accordance with Sections 409A and
424(a), as applicable, of the Code.

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except as set forth in
Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly
or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock
or other equity interests of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of
such shares or equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of the Company has
or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise

Subsidiary.

and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due

expense reimbursement provisions and  



 

37  conditions to consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, (A) is

this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company pays or causes to be paid to
Parent the Break-Up Fee, the Break-Up Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent hereunder and the Company will not have any
further obligations or liabilities to Parent with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, except as provided in Sections 7.2(b)
and 7.3(f).

"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant
to Section 9.1(f) (as a result of a breach by the Company of any of its
covenants under Section 7.3(a) or (c), Section 7.4 or 7.5) or pursuant to
Section 9.1(h), or (y) the occurrence of any of the following events within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(c), provided that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made after the
date hereof and prior to such termination (which shall not have been withdrawn
in good faith prior to such termination): (i) the Company merges with or into,
or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a Third
Party; (ii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly acquires more than 50% of
the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii)
a Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock; or (iv) the Company adopts or implements a
plan of liquidation, recapitalization or share repurchase relating to more
than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or an extraordinary dividend
relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 50% of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As used
herein, "Third Party" means any person as defined in Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than Parent or its affiliates).

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.3(e)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Company fails to pay to Parent the Break-up Fee,
promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in
collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment was
due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.



 

38 7.4 _Shareholder Meetings_. The Company and Parent each shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective shareholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after
the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject, in the case of the Company, to the right of the Company and
its Board of Directors to take action permitted by Section 7.3(b) with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Parent each will, through its
respective Board of Directors, recommend to its respective shareholders
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its shareholders in
connection with this Agreement. Parent will, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders an amendment to Parents Bylaws to permit
Parents Board of Directors to increase the number of Parent directors as
provided in Section 7.13. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the foregoing matters, with a view towards, among
other things, holding the respective meetings of each partys shareholders on
the same day.

 

7.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval.

7.6 _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company to deliver to
Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a written
agreement, in the form of Exhibit 7.6 hereto.

7.7 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, as of the Effective Time.

7.8 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. (a) Following the Effective
Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans,
including severance plans (each a "Parent Plan"), of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent that similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate; provided, however,  



 

39  that, in the case of all benefits then provided to the Company Employees,
until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent may instead provide
such employees with participation in the employee benefit plans of the
Company in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in Parents employee
benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans).
From and after the Effective Time, Parent may elect not to provide to the
Company Employees any benefits which are not then provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries to their employees notwithstanding that such benefits were
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to their employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In the case of benefits which are provided at the
Effective Time by Parent to employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries but are
not then provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to their employees,
Parent will as soon as possible, and in all events within one year, after the
Effective Time include the Company Employees in the plans under which such
benefits are made available.

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken into
account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service
credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including
for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of
defined benefit pension benefits); provided however, that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations, if permitted by the
Parent Plan. If permitted by the Parent Plan, each Parent Plan shall waive
pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable Company Plan, and Company Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Parent Plan.

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in
accordance with their terms all agreements listed in Section 7.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Benefit Agreements"). Parent acknowledges
and agrees that (i) the Merger will constitute a "change in control" of
the Company for all purposes under such agreements and (ii) calendar year
2007 shall be deemed to be the most recent "year" for purposes of calculating
any severance or change-in-control payments due under the Benefit Agreements
in connection with the Merger, the salary used in calculating any portion of
such payments shall be the individuals salary, on an annualized basis, in
effect as of the date hereof, and the Company is authorized, notwithstanding
any contrary provisions herein, to amend the Benefit Agreements to clarify
the intentions set forth in this Section 7.8(c)(ii). The provisions of this
Section 7.8(c) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each director, officer or employee that is a party to any Benefit
Agreement.



 

40 (d) Parent and the Company agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may adopt a severance plan (the "Severance Plan"), and a change in
control retention plan (the "Retention Plan") as provided in Section 6.1(i) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any Plan or otherwise, Parent agrees from and after the Closing
Date to maintain in full force and effect, without amendment or modification,
(i) for a period of no less than one year following the Closing Date, the
Severance Plan and (ii) the Retention Plan until such time as all Parent or
Company obligations are fulfilled thereunder. The Severance Plan shall provide
each Company employee two weeks of severance pay (at his then current pay
rate) for each year of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
prior to such Company employees employment termination date; provided that
the minimum benefit for Company employees shall be four weeks salary, and the
maximum severance benefit will be twenty-six weeks salary. The Severance
Plan shall also include a supplemental cash severance pool having an aggregate
amount of $350,000 from which additional severance benefits may be awarded to
Company employees at the discretion of Mr. Eddie Dunklebarger, subject to the
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend all Plans that are
or could be subject to Section 409A of the Code to comply with the final
regulations under Section 409A, subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent.

7.9 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company,
any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective
predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed
that after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as
and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation incurred by each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with
Parent; provided, however, that (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
 



 

41  defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent shall in
all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), (4) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law, and (5) Parent shall have
no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party in respect of any such loss,
claim, damage, liability, cost, expense, judgment or amount paid in
settlements which arose out of or resulted from the gross negligence, criminal
activity, willful misconduct or recklessness of the Indemnified Party. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 7.9,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall promptly notify Parent thereof, provided that the failure to so notify
shall not affect the obligations of Parent under this Section 7.9 except to
the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parents
obligations under this Section 7.9 shall continue in full force and effect
without time limit from and after the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such.

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

7.10 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the  



 

42  proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

7.11 _Coordination of Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement each of
Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock
and the record dates and payments dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that the holders of Company Common Stock shall not
receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any
single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock
and any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common
Stock receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

7.12 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all such necessary
action to terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and provide that (i) all payroll accumulations credited to participants
accounts under the ESPP for the option period (as such term is defined in the
ESPP) beginning immediately prior to and including the Effective Time shall
be promptly returned to such participants, and (ii) no shares of Company
Common Stock shall be purchased by participants for such option period. In
addition, upon the effective termination of the ESPP, the Company shall
distribute all shares held in participants accounts to the respective
participants in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

7.13 _Appointment of Directors_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause each of the three classes of its Board of Directors to
be expanded by two members, and shall appoint the Company Directors (as
defined below) to fill the vacancies on Parents Board of Directors created by
such increase, each to hold office until his or her successor is elected and
qualified or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent. If any of the Company Directors does not
become, or does not continue in the office of, a director of Parent because of
death, disability or otherwise, Parent agrees, after consultation with the
remaining Company Directors, to cause a member of the Board of Directors of
the Company as of the date hereof who is mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Company to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent as the
replacement Company Director. The term "Company Directors" shall mean Mr.
Eddie L. Dunklebarger (who shall also be appointed Vice Chairman of the Parent
Board of Directors) and five individuals who shall be mutually selected by
the Company and Parent from the independent members of the Companys Board of
Directors to become members of the Board of Directors of Parent as of the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 7.13. Nothing in this Section 7.13
shall require the election or appointment of any individual whose election or
appointment is prohibited or advised against by any Regulatory Agency.
Following the expiration of each Company Directors initial term of office,
Parent will recommend such Company Director for re-nomination to a three-year
term of office by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the
Parent Board of Directors (the "Nominating Committee"), and such
nomination will be subject to the reasonable discretion of the Nominating
Committee.

months by an outplacement agency selected by Parent.



 

44 7.17 _Dividend Reinvestment_. The Company shall take all such necessary action
to terminate the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "DRIP") effective
as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement (taking into account any
Company dividends that have been declared but not yet paid as of the date

shall distribute all shares of Company Common Stock and the value of all cash
held in participants plan accounts in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of both the Company and Parent:

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party (i)
30 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or  



 

47  recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite
Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial
or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been
filed with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided, however, that no
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein) or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before January 31, 2008, unless the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or the Company provided that it shall not be in material
breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.4 if any approval of the

obtain, after the use of all reasonable efforts, the required vote at a duly
held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement

not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such
representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under
Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by the
Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or
warranty by Parent);

(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is

product of 0.800 and the Starting Price; and



 

48 (2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below)
and subtracting 0.200 from such quotient (such number being referred to
herein as the "Index Ratio");

subject to the following. If the Company elects to exercise its termination
right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written notice to Parent; provided that such notice of election to terminate
may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned two-day period. During
the period commencing with its receipt of such notice and ending at the
Effective Time, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio
and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration in a manner such, and to the extent
required, so that the condition set forth in either clause (1) or (2) above
shall be deemed not to exist; provided, however, that the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall not be increased in a manner that would cause the failure
of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(d) or 8.3(d) hereof.

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased so
that the Per Share Consideration (calculated by using the Average
Closing Price, as provided in the definition of "Per Share Consideration")
after such increase is not less than 82% of the Per Share Consideration
calculated by using the Starting Price in lieu of the Average Closing Price.

For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:

the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased so
that the Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less than the Index Ratio.

If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio
and/or Per Share Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio and/or Per
Share Cash Consideration, and derivatively the Per Share Stock Consideration
and/or Total Cash Amount, shall have been so modified), and any references in
this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio," "Per Share Cash Consideration," "Per Share
Stock Consideration" and "Total Cash Amount" shall thereafter be deemed to
refer to the Exchange Ratio, Per Share Cash Consideration, Per Share Stock
Consideration and Total Cash Amount after giving effect to any adjustment made
pursuant to this Section  



 

49 9.1(g). For purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:

"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by dividing (x) the sum of
(A) the Average Closing Price plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the
aggregate increase in transaction value resulting from an increase in the
Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration by the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding multiplied by the initial Exchange
Ratio and the percentage offered as stock (90%), on the Determination Date, by
(y) the Starting Price. For purposes of calculating the increase in
transaction value, the price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed
to be the Average Closing Price.

"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices per
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
mutually agreed upon authoritative source) for the twenty consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the Determination Date (as defined in Section
1.4(a) hereof).

"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index. 

"Per Share Consideration" means the sum of (i) 90% of the product of the Per
Share Stock Consideration times the Average Closing Price plus (ii) 10% of
the Per Share Cash Consideration.

"Starting Date" means the trading day on the NASDAQ Stock Market preceding
the day on which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.

"Starting Price" means $22.97. 

If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the
prices for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).

(h) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, or (ii) prior to acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock
any person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) shall have become the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of at
least 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b), 7.3(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding  



 

50  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval and
adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby, by the shareholders of either the Company or Parent; provided,
however, that after any approval and adoption of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, there may not be, without
further approval and adoption of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to
be delivered to the Company shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated
by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.4 _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

10.6  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become

delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not

equity.

10.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without

Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.
