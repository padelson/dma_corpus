WEDGE Well through a wholly owned subsidiary corporation to be formed by
Pioneer under the Laws of the State of Delaware prior to the Closing.

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for all of the
Purchased Securities (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be $260,000,000 (the "
_Base Purchase Price_ "), as such amount is adjusted pursuant to this _Section
2.2_.

(a) _Acquisition Purchase Price_. The Base Purchase Price will be increased by
an amount equal to $4,867,589, which is the total purchase price paid
pursuant to the Phoenix Purchase Agreement.

(b) _Capital Expenditures_. The Base Purchase Price will be increased by an
amount equal to the sum of (i) $31,751,000 (representing the Parties
agreement as to the amount of Qualified Capital Expenditures of the Acquired
Companies between May 31, 2007 and December 31, 2007) and (ii) the aggregate
amount of Qualified Capital Expenditures of the Acquired Companies between
January 1, 2008 and the Closing Date.



 

10 (c) _Indebtedness_. The Base Purchase Price will be decreased by the
aggregate amount of all items described in the definition of " _Indebtedness_
" as of the Closing, which shall not include (i) any element of "
_Indebtedness_ " to the extent included in the definition of Net Working
Capital and deducted from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_ or (ii) any element of " _Indebtedness_ " related to the Wachovia Loan
Documents, which shall be repaid by WEDGE Energy at the Closing.

(d) _Working Capital_. The Base Purchase Price will be (i) increased by the
amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net
Working Capital or (ii) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital.

2.3 _Payment of Estimated Purchase Price at Closing_. At the Closing, Pioneer
shall deliver an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to such account or accounts as the
Seller Representative may designate for disbursement to the Sellers.

2.4 _Estimation and Reconciliation of the Purchase Price_.

(a) _Estimated Purchase Price_. On or prior to the second Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Pioneer a
statement (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth the Seller
Representatives good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the " _Estimated
Purchase Price_ ") and providing reasonable detail with respect to each
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price required pursuant to _Section 2.2_. The
Estimated Purchase Price shall be determined in accordance with GAAP
consistent with the Acquired Companies past accounting practices. The amount
set forth on the Estimated Statement shall be the amount of Estimated Purchase
Price payable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

(b) _Post-Closing Reconciliation_. Within 180 days after the Closing, Pioneer
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a statement (the "
_Reconciliation Statement_ ") setting forth Pioneers determination of the
actual amount of the Purchase Price (the " _Reconciled Purchase Price_ ") and
providing reasonable detail with respect to each adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price required pursuant to _Section 2.2_. The Reconciled Purchase
Price shall be determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Acquired
Companies past accounting practices. The Seller Representative may object to
the Reconciliation Statement within sixty (60) days after its receipt thereof
by delivering to Pioneer a response to the Reconciliation Statement setting
forth each adjustment to the Base Purchase Price that is disputed by the
Seller Representative, the particular elements comprising such adjustment that
are disputed by the Seller Representative, and the Seller Representatives
good faith determination of the correct amount of each such adjustment
and element. The Seller Representative will provide reasonable detail with
respect to the nature of its dispute with each disputed adjustment and element
and the manner of its determination of the amount(s) thereof.

(c) _Final Determination of Purchase Price_.

(i) If the Seller Representative does not deliver an objection to the
Reconciliation Statement within the sixty-day period provided in  _Section
2.4(b)_, the Reconciled Purchase Price shown on the Reconciliation Statement
shall be deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of
making any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_. 



 

11 (ii) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to the Reconciliation
Statement within the sixty-day period provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ and,
following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, Pioneer and the Seller
Representative reach agreement on the amount of the Reconciled Purchase Price
(whether by resolving each disputed item to their mutual satisfaction or
compromising any or all disputed items), then the amount of Purchase Price so
agreed by them will be deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price for
purposes of making any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

(iii) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to
the Reconciliation Statement within the sixty-day period provided in _Section
2.4(b)_ and, following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, the
difference in the amount of the Purchase Price determined by Pioneer and the
amount of the Purchase Price determined by the Seller Representative (after
reflecting the resolution of any disputed items by the parties) is less than
or equal to $75,000, then the arithmetic mean between such two amounts shall
be deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making
any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

(iv) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to the Reconciliation
Statement within the sixty-day period provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ and,
following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, the difference in the
amount of Purchase Price determined by Pioneer and the amount of the Purchase
Price determined by the Seller Representative (after reflecting the resolution
of any disputed items by the parties) is greater than $75,000, then the final
amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making any adjustment required
pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_ shall be determined in accordance with _Section
2.4(d)_.

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_.

(i) In accordance with _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_, Pioneer and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall promptly refer all remaining
disputes concerning the Purchase Price to Ernst and Young LLP (or, if Ernst and
Young LLP is not independent or otherwise refuses or is incapable of
undertaking the resolution of such disputes, to such other nationally
recognized independent accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to
Pioneer and the Seller Representative) (as applicable, the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "), together with a statement of the Purchase Price asserted
by the Seller Representative and by Pioneer. The Independent Accounting Firm
will be instructed to resolve such disputes within sixty (60) days of the
referral. 

(ii) Pioneer and the Seller Representative will make available to the
Independent Accounting Firm, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice
at any time during the pendency of any dispute under this _Section 2.4(d)_,
the work papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Reconciliation
Statement and the Seller Representatives objections to the Reconciliation
Statement, and the books and records of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies
relating to the Purchase Price. Pioneer and the Seller  



 

12  Representative shall have the right to meet jointly with the Independent
Accounting Firm during this period to present their respective positions.
The Independent Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on the
presentations by Pioneer and the Seller Representative and not by independent
review. The Independent Accounting Firm shall address only those matters in
dispute and may not allow a value greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The amount of the Purchase Price determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ will be the
final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making any adjustment
required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_. The resolution of disputes by the
Independent Accounting Firm and its determination of the Purchase Price will
be set forth in writing and will be conclusive and binding upon Pioneer, the
Seller Representative, the Sellers and all other interested Persons. The
determination of the Purchase Price by the Independent Accounting Firm will
become final and binding upon the date of such determination.

(iii) Pioneer and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) will
each pay their own respective fees and expenses (including any fees and
expenses of their accountants and other representatives) in connection with
the resolution of disputes pursuant to this _Section
2.4(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm incurred in connection with the resolution of
disputes arising under this _Section 2.4(d)_ will be paid by Pioneer and the
Seller Representative in proportion to the difference between the Purchase
Price determined by the Independent Accounting Firm and the respective amounts
of the Purchase Price asserted by each such party at the time of the initial
referral of the Purchase Price disputes to the Independent Accounting Firm.

(e) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. The amount, if any, by which the
final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid by
Pioneer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as the Seller Representative may designate for disbursement to the
Sellers. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds
the final Purchase Price shall be paid by the Seller Representative (on behalf
of the Sellers) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as Pioneer may designate. Any payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(e)_ will be (i) due and payable five (5) Business Days following
the determination of the final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_
(and if necessary  _Section 2.4(d)_) and (ii) deemed to be an adjustment to
the Estimated Purchase Price.

(f) _Availability of Records_. Pioneer will make available to the Seller
Representative and its accountants and other representatives, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice (and copies thereof at Pioneers sole cost
and expense), at any time during (i) the review by the Seller Representative
of the Reconciliation Statement and (ii) the pendency of any dispute
resolution under _Section 2.4(d)_, the books and records of the Acquired
Companies relevant to the Purchase Price. 

2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Pioneer and the Sellers shall treat for
all Tax purposes (including the filing of all Tax Returns) $134,413,000 as
the amount that Pioneer pays at the Closing to the Sellers for all the capital
stock of WEDGE Wireline and shall treat for all Tax purposes (including the
filing of all Tax Returns) the balance of the Purchase Price that Pioneer
pays at the Closing  



 

13  to the Sellers as having been paid for the limited liability company
interests of WEDGE Fishing and of WEDGE Well. Any adjustments to the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_ or _Section 10.6_ shall increase or
decrease, as the case may be, the amount that is so treated as having been
paid for (a) all of the capital stock of WEDGE Wireline or (b) the
limited liability company interests of WEDGE Fishing and of WEDGE Well to the
extent that such adjustment is determined by facts that relate to (x) WEDGE
Wireline or (y) WEDGE Fishing or WEDGE Well, respectively. The amount (as
adjusted) that is treated as having been paid for all of the limited
liability company interests of WEDGE Fishing and of WEDGE Well shall be
allocated for federal income Tax purposes among the assets of WEDGE Fishing
and the assets of WEDGE Well in accordance with their respective fair market
values. Each of Pioneer and the Sellers may file its Tax Returns reflecting
the allocation of such amount among the assets of WEDGE Fishing and the assets
of WEDGE Well as determined by it. In an effort to use the same values for
such purposes, Pioneer agrees to provide the Seller Representative with
information as to the fair market values that it intends to use for such
filings and Seller Representative agrees to provide Pioneer with information
as to the fair market values that the Sellers intend to use for such filings.

2.6 _The Closing_.

(a) _Date and Location of Closing_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other than
conditions that are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and in

outstanding Order to which any Acquired Company is subject or by which its

result in or cause any payment (whether of separation, severance or

distribution or increase in benefits with respect to any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or any current or former director, officer or employee of any
Acquired Company or give rise to any obligation to fund any such payment or

(e) Each Employee Benefit Plan and all related trusts, insurance contracts
and funds have been maintained, funded and administered in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and

Plan, or any party dealing with such Company Employee Benefit Plan, to any
material Tax or penalty (whether civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA or the
Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.18(e) of the Disclosure Schedule,
no Proceedings with respect to the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other than

such Company Employee Benefit Plans are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened and there are no facts that could reasonably give rise to
or reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Proceedings.

3(37) of ERISA, has been, during the six (6) years preceding the Closing,
transferred out of the controlled group of companies (within the meaning
of Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) of the Code) of which any Acquired Company is
a member or was a member during such six-year period.



 

28 (g) No Seller, no Acquired Company and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no
officer, director, employee or agent of any Seller or any Acquired Company
has made any statements, whether oral or written, regarding the Company
Employee Benefit Plans or other compensation or benefit arrangements to be
maintained (or not to be maintained) by Pioneer or the Acquired Companies
after the Closing that will result in additional liability to the Acquired
Companies or Pioneer, whether direct or indirect, in excess of any existing
liability of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing.

seeking such a determination has not expired. The Sellers have delivered to
Pioneer a copy of the most recent such determination letter and, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, nothing has occurred since the date of
such determination letter that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualification of such Employee Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt
status of such related trust.

provided Pioneer with true, complete and correct copies, to the extent
applicable, of (i) all documents pursuant to which the Company Employee

all Liabilities for Taxes for the periods covered by such Tax Returns. All
Taxes due and owing under applicable Laws by each Acquired Company for any
period beginning on or after January 1, 2004 (whether or not shown to be due
and payable on such Tax Returns), have been paid in full. No Acquired Company

of time within which to file any Tax Return for any period beginning on or
after January 1, 2004, which Tax Return has not been filed.

(b) No Acquired Company is under audit or examination by any Taxing Authority

result of any such examinations that have not been resolved and fully paid)
or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment
and collection under applicable Laws, after giving effect to extensions or
waivers, has expired. No Tax Return filed by any Acquired Company with
respect to any Tax period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, has been
examined by any Taxing Authority, and no Acquired Company has agreed to any
extension or waiver of the statute of limitations applicable to any Tax, or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or

closing agreement, compromise, ruling or other agreement with any Taxing
Authority that relates to the assessment or collection of Taxes and which will
not have been terminated prior to the Closing Date, and from and after the
Closing Date, no Acquired Company shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder for any taxable period (whether past, current or future
taxable periods).

(f) Except for liens for property Taxes not yet due and payable, there are no
Security Interests for unpaid Taxes on the assets of any Acquired Company and
no claim for unpaid Taxes has been made by any Taxing Authority that could
give rise to any such Security Interest.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.19(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Acquired Company (i) is, or ever has been, a member of an "affiliated group"
of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code with respect to
any period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, or (ii) has or may have any
liability for any Tax of any Person under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), or as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. 

(h) The aggregate liability of the Acquired Companies for unpaid Taxes for all
periods ending on or before the Latest Balance Sheet Date does not exceed the
amount of the current liability accrual for Taxes (excluding reserves for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. Since the Latest Balance Sheet
Date, no Acquired Company has incurred Taxes other than Taxes incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

(i) Each Acquired Company has withheld or collected and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority all Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld or collected on or after January 1, 2004, including withholding of
Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441 through 1464, 3401 through 3406, 6041 and
6049 of the Code and similar provisions under any state, local or foreign Law.
Each Acquired Company has properly received and maintained any and all
certificates, forms and other documents required by applicable Law for any
exemption from withholding and remitting any Taxes that would otherwise have
been withheld or collected on or after January 1, 2004.

(j) No Acquired Company is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
plan, individually or in the aggregate, that has resulted, or could result
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
(A) the payment of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code, or (B) an obligation to indemnify, gross-up or otherwise
compensate any Person, in whole or in part, for any excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code that is imposed on such Person or any other Person.

or intended to be governed by Section 355 of the Code.

(l) No Acquired Company has engaged in any transaction described as a
"reportable transaction" in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b),
including any transaction that is the same or substantially similar to a
transaction that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction or
that the IRS has identified through a notice, Treasury Regulation or other
form of published guidance as a "listed transaction," as such term is defined
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

(m) No Acquired Company owns a direct interest in real estate that as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would
result in the imposition of any realty transfer Tax or similar Tax.

(n) Each of the entities set forth in Section 3.19(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule will, at the Closing and on the day before the Closing Date, be
disregarded for U.S. federal Tax purposes under Treasury Regulations §§
301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 (and state, local, and foreign tax purposes where
applicable) (a " _Disregarded Entity_ ") and, therefore, the purchase of the
existing and outstanding limited liability company interests of each of such
entities pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes as the purchase by Pioneer of all the assets held by each of such
entities. No action has been or will be taken prior to the Closing that would
result in any of the entities set forth in Section 3.19(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule being classified as an entity that is not a Disregarded Entity for
U.S. federal tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign tax Law for purposes
of which it is stated to be disregarded in such Section 3.19(n)).

(o) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any action by an
Acquired Company, or by another Person that binds an Acquired Company, that
was in either case taken at or before the Closing as to any:

(i) change in the method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date of any Acquired Company;

(ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law)
executed by an Acquired Company, or by another Person that binds an Acquired
Company, on or prior to the Closing Date;

(iii) intercompany transaction that occurred on or before the Closing Date or
excess loss account described in the Treasury Regulations promulgated
pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law) that existed as of the
close of business on the Closing Date;



 

32 (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made by an Acquired
Company on or prior to the Closing Date; or

(v) prepaid amount received by an Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing
Date. 

(p) Since January 1, 2004, no Acquired Company has received written notice
that a claim has been made by any Taxing Authority or other governmental
entity in a jurisdiction where the applicable Acquired Company does not file
Tax Returns that the Acquired Company is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits.

(e) There are no material Environmental Liabilities relating to the Acquired
Companies that arise out of the operations of the Acquired Companies prior to
Closing, except for such Liabilities as have been satisfied or otherwise
resolved. No valid and subsisting Security Interests arising under or
pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws exist against any property
owned, used, operated or leased by any Acquired Company.

(f) No Acquired Company has received any written notice from any Person
(including any governmental authority or the current or prior owner or
operator of any Acquired Companys properties or facilities) for the last five
years alleging (i) any material violation or failure to comply by an Acquired
Company with any Environmental Law, (ii) any obligation for any Acquired
Company to undertake or bear the cost of any material Environmental
Liabilities or (iii) any harm to the Environment for which an Acquired Company
is potentially responsible at any Relevant Property or any other facility or

33  been generated, manufactured, refined, processed, treated, used, imported,

copies of all material final reports, studies, analyses and tests relating to
compliance by the Business or an Acquired Company with Environmental Laws that

default with respect to its obligations under any of such insurance policies
(including with respect to the payment of premiums), and, to the Knowledge of
the Sellers, no event has occurred that, with notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute such a default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration under such policy. No Acquired Company and no Seller
has received any written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier
with respect to the policies described in Section 3.21 of the Disclosure
Schedule that there has been or will be a cancellation or non-renewal of, or

such Confidential Information in accordance with and for the limited purpose
of compliance with such subpoena, court order or process, without liability

such Acquired Companys certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws
(or similar governing documents for any non-corporate Acquired Company), (ii)
any Released Party from any obligations under the Prior Acquisition Agreements
to the extent such obligations are to be paid or performed after the Closing
Date, (iii) any Released Party from any rights that the Seller and its Related
Parties may have under _Section 9.11_ of this Agreement, (iv) any Released

current payroll period through and including the Closing Date and (B) benefits
to which such person is entitled under the health, disability and welfare
plans, policies or arrangements of the Acquired Companies in which such person
 



 

44  participates to the extent relating to the period prior to and including the
Closing Date, in each case consistent with the Acquired Companies
historical plans, policies and past practices (and specifically excluding any
change of control, severance, retention or transaction payments or any other
one-time transaction bonuses or fees). Except as set forth in _Section 9.11_,
no Seller shall be entitled to contribution from, subrogation to or recovery
against any Acquired Company with respect to any liability of any Seller that
may arise under or pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreements and
documents executed in connection with or to be executed in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.11 _Antitrust Matters_. Pioneer and the Sellers shall promptly respond to
all requests from the Federal Trade Commission and the United States
Department of Justice for additional information or documentation with respect

by Pioneer.

6.12  _Employment Offers_. The Seller Representative acknowledges and agrees
that Pioneer has approached certain employees of WEH Services, L.L.C., a
subsidiary of WEDGE Energy, and made arrangements or entered into agreements
with one or more such employees concerning becoming employees of Pioneer or
any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing. All of such offers of
employment are and shall be expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the
Closing.

6.13 _Receivables Repurchase_. If the aggregate accounts receivable of the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing (the " _Closing Date AR_ ") is not
collected in full by the Acquired Companies, using reasonable and customary
collection efforts, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the due date
therefor, Pioneer shall have the right, by giving written notice to the
Seller Representative at any time before the six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing, to cause the Acquired Companies to put the uncollected portion of the
Closing Date AR, net of any reserve established therefor deducted from Net
Working Capital for purposes of determining the final amount of the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (the " _Closing Date Bad Debt Reserve_ "),
back to the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). If Pioneer
exercises such put option, then, within five (5) Business Days of Pioneers
delivery of the notice of exercise, the Acquired Companies shall assign the
uncollected portion of the Closing Date AR to the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) and the Seller Representative shall (on behalf of the
Sellers) assume such accounts from the Acquired Companies and pay to Pioneer
an amount with respect to such accounts (collectively, the " _Repurchase
Price_ ") that is equal to the difference between (a) the aggregate amount of
such accounts (net of the Closing Date Bad Debt Reserve) and (b) the aggregate
amount actually collected by the Acquired Companies with respect to such
accounts as of the date of such assignment. The Seller Representative shall
deliver the Repurchase Price to Pioneer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as Pioneer may designate.
Any payment of Repurchase Price will be deemed to be an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. Any amounts received by Pioneer in payment of an account shall
be applied to the oldest outstanding balances for that account, unless
otherwise specified by the party making such payment (without consultation
with Pioneer) or unless the party making such payment indicates that they are
not paying any older outstanding balance for any reason (including disputes as
to pricing or service level). Pioneer shall not be entitled to reduce,
eliminate or otherwise compromise any accounts receivable subject to its put
right under this _Section 6.13_ without the prior consent of the Seller
Representative. Pioneer shall provide Sellers with an aging accounts
receivable report on the 31st, 61st and 91st days after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything therein to the contrary, if the aggregate amount of
the Closing Date AR that is not collected in full is less than the Closing
Date Bad Debt Reserve, then Pioneer shall pay the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) an amount equal to the difference between (a) Closing
Date Bad Debt Reserve and (b) the uncollected portion of the Closing Date AR.

following the end of such negotiation period. A claim asserted in a Claim
Certificate that has become a Non-Litigated Claim may not be reasserted in a
separate Claim Certificate as a new claim subject to the provisions of this 
_Section 6.14_ or _Article 9_.

prior to such three (3) year anniversary), then the stated amount of the
Letter of Credit shall be reduced to such dollar amount of Pending Claims and
unpaid Resolved Claims as of such date.

(e) _Presentment Events_. Subject to _Section 6.14(f)_, Pioneer shall have
the right, power and authority, without prior demand on, or payment by, the

ceases to maintain a long-term senior unsecured credit rating of AA or better
from SandP (or a comparable rating from another nationally recognized rating
service), unless within such thirty (30) day period the Seller Representative
has delivered a substitute Letter of Credit, identical in amount and terms

which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to the Letter of Credit
being replaced, issued or confirmed by a U.S. Bank; or



 

47 (iii) the current expiration date of the Letter of Credit has not been
extended for an additional period of not less than twelve months (or a
replacement or substitute Letter of Credit having an expiration date not less

identical in amount and terms (other than such changes in non-material terms
to which Pioneer may consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) to the expiring Letter of Credit, issued or confirmed by a U.S.
Bank, has not been delivered to Pioneer) before the close of business on the
tenth (10th) Business Day prior to such expiration date unless the Required
Letter of Credit Period has expired in accordance with _Section 6.14(c)_.

(f) _Conditions Precedent to Draws_. In order to draw any funds on the Letter

Presentment Event. In order to draw on such funds, Pioneer shall deliver a
presentation certificate (in the form attached to the Letter of Credit)
certifying, _inter alia_ , that Pioneer has complied with all conditions
precedent specified in this _Section 6.14(f)_. In no event shall the Issuing
Bank have any obligation to confirm or consult with any other party, including
the Seller Representative, as to the permissibility of the draw and shall
immediately pay over such amounts to or at the direction of Pioneer in
accordance with this _Section 6.14_.

(g) _Termination_. If no Presentment Events have occurred or if no
Presentment Events have occurred that resulted in drawing down the entire
amount of the Letter of Credit, then upon the expiration of the Required
Letter of Credit Period, Pioneer shall execute and deliver to the Seller
Representative a termination statement (in the form attached to the Letter of
Credit) and shall surrender or return the original Letter of Credit to the
Seller Representative, whereupon the Seller Representative may present both
the executed termination certificate and the original Letter of Credit to the
Issuing Bank for termination.

responsible for all fees, expenses and other costs relating to the Letter of
Credit.

Pioneers independent public accountants) all historical accounting records in
its possession related to the Business and (b) use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with Pioneers efforts to prepare, and obtain
reports of independent public accountants with respect to, such financial
statements and any related footnotes and disclosures as Pioneer may be
required to file with its Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Purchase
Transaction, provided that the preparation of such financial statements is not
a condition to Closing.

6.16 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Sellers shall have the right from time to
time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which if existing or
known at the date of this Agreement would have been required to be set forth
or described in such Disclosure Schedule. Any such supplemental or amended
disclosure (other than the disclosure of an item (individually or
together with other items so disclosed or otherwise)  



 

48  that results in or constitutes a Material Adverse Change) shall be deemed to
have cured any such breach of representation or warranty made in this
Agreement and to have been disclosed as of the date of this Agreement, in
each case solely for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth
in _Section 7.1_ has been satisfied (and in no event for purposes of
determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 7.3_ has been
satisfied or for purposes of indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_ ).

6.17  _Books and Records_. For so long as any Tax year of the Sellers or of
an Acquired Company remains open, Pioneer shall preserve and retain the books
and records of the Acquired Companies and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, shall make such books and records available at the then
current administrative headquarters of Pioneer to the Seller Representative
and its officers, directors, employees and agents, upon reasonable notice and
at reasonable times, at the Seller Representatives cost and expense, it
being understood that the Seller Representative shall be entitled to make
copies of any such books and records as shall be reasonably necessary. For a
period of five years after the Closing Date, Sellers shall preserve and
retain their books and records pertaining to the Acquired Companies and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall make such books and records
available at a reasonable location within the United States to Pioneer and
its officers, directors, employees and agents, upon reasonable notice and at
reasonable times, at Pioneers cost and expense, it being understood that
Pioneer shall be entitled to make copies of any such books and records as
shall be reasonably necessary.

6.18 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Pioneer shall cause each Acquired Company to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under such
Acquired Companys certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar governing documents for any non-corporate Acquired Company) in effect
on the date hereof, each director and officer of such Acquired Company prior
to the Closing, including, without limitation, officers and directors serving
as such on the date hereof (collectively, " _Covered Persons_ "), against any
losses or expenses incurred by any such Person in such Persons capacity as
an officer or director of such Acquired Company in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Acquired Company shall be obligated to indemnify any officer or director for
any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(b) From and after the Closing, Pioneer shall cause each Acquired Company to
indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person in accordance with the
indemnification provisions currently set forth in such Acquired Companys
certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing
documents for any non-corporate Acquired Company) in effect on the date hereof
for a period of not less than six (6) years following the Closing,
irrespective of whether any such provisions are amended after the Closing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Pioneer shall obtain a six-year officer and director
insurance policy covering the Acquired Companies officers and directors as of
the date of this Agreement (provided, however, that, if such insurance
expires, is terminated or is canceled during such six-year period, Pioneer
shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, obtain officers and
directors liability insurance covering such acts or omissions with
respect to each such Person for the remainder of such six-year period).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that no Seller
shall have any claim for indemnification against any of the Acquired Companies
pursuant to such  



 

49  provisions by reason of the fact that he or she was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of any such Acquired Company or was serving at the request
of any such Acquired Company as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
employee, or agent of another entity (whether such claim is for judgments,
damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses,
expenses, or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute,
charter document, bylaw, agreement, or otherwise) with respect to any
Proceeding brought by any Pioneer Indemnitee against the Sellers pursuant to
_Article 9_ (it being understood that a Seller who is an individual may
pursue a claim for indemnification against any of the Acquired Companies
pursuant to such provisions in connection with any third party claim brought
against such Seller who is an individual, including a third party claim for
which indemnification is required under _Article 9_ ).

(e) If any Acquired Company or its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of such Acquired Company assume in full the
obligations set forth in _Section 6.18(a)_, _Section 6.18(b)_ and  _Section
6.18(c)_.

6.19 _Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, Pioneer, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates shall fully cooperate with the
Sellers and their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") as such
Seller Parties may reasonably request, at such Seller Parties expense, in
connection with (a) any audit (an " _Insurance Audit_ ") by any carrier
providing insurance coverage for the business, properties and assets of the
Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date, (b) the defense or prosecution
of any Proceeding against or by the Seller Parties relating to or arising out
of the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing
Date (other than litigation among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising
out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and (c) the collection
of Retained AR. Such cooperation shall be provided during the normal business
hours of the Acquired Companies (and their respective Affiliates) and in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of their
respective businesses. In that connection, Pioneer and its Affiliates shall
afford the Seller Parties a reasonable opportunity to investigate the facts
relating to the Insurance Audit, Proceeding or Retained AR, including,
but not limited to, interviewing prospective witnesses under the control or
influence of Pioneer or its Affiliates and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, inspecting books, records and properties of Pioneer and its
Affiliates relevant to the Insurance Audit, Proceeding or Retained AR.

6.20 _Assignment of Prior Acquisition Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, WEDGE
Energy shall assign the Prior Acquisition Agreements to the Acquired
Companies (to the extent not in the name of an Acquired Company as of the date
of this Agreement) pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Pioneer and the Seller
Representative.

6.21 _Repayment of Intercompany Indebtedness_. Prior to or on the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall net and settle, forgive, dividend or
contribute all intercompany accounts (including obligations to pay any
dividends declared prior to the Closing) (a) between the Sellers and their
respective subsidiaries and Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquired
Companies, on the other hand or (b) between or among the Acquired Companies.
The effect of the foregoing shall be to remove or satisfy, prior to the
Closing, all such intercompany accounts and all obligations to pay dividends
declared prior to the Closing. In connection with the foregoing, all cash and
cash equivalents held by any Acquired Company may be used (i) to pay any such
intercompany account liabilities of such Acquired Company and (ii) to make
dividends or distributions to the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries
and Affiliates (provided that any dividends so declared are paid prior to the
Closing), so as to minimize cash and cash equivalents taken into account in
determining the Estimated Purchase Price and the Reconciled Purchase Price.



 

50 6.22 _Retained AR_. Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall assign
to Sellers any and all accounts receivable of the Acquired Companies that
have been written off by the Acquired Companies as a bad debt in accordance
with GAAP (collectively, the " _Retained AR_ ").

ARTICLE 8

Agreement in the circumstances and in the manner provided below:

(a) Pioneer and the Seller Representative may terminate this Agreement by
mutual written agreement;



 

53 (b) Pioneer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Seller Representative if (i) Pioneer is not then in breach in any material
respect of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) any Seller is in
breach in any material respect of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement (which breach has not been cured within ten (10)
Business Days after notice thereof has been received by the breaching party
from Pioneer);

(c) Pioneer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Seller Representative if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
close of business on the Closing Deadline by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.1_ to be satisfied (other than a
condition to be fulfilled by action to be taken at the Closing), unless the
failure results primarily from Pioneers breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement;

(d) The Seller Representative may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to Pioneer if (i) no Seller is not then in breach in any material
respect of its respective obligations under this Agreement and (ii) Pioneer is
in breach in any material respect of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement (which breach has not been cured within ten (10)
Business Days after notice thereof has been received by Pioneer from the
Seller Representative); or

(e) The Seller Representative may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to Pioneer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
close of business on the Closing Deadline by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied (other than a
condition to be fulfilled by action to be taken at the Closing), unless the
failure results primarily from any Sellers breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party to
consummate the Purchase Transaction or the other transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the provisions of  _Section 8.3_,
if applicable, shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement, (b) no such termination shall relieve any Party
from liability for damages arising out of or with respect to the breach of
this Agreement by such Party prior to such termination and (c) the
confidentiality provisions of _Section 6.9_ and the expense allocation
provisions of _Section 12.11_ shall remain in full force and effect and
survive any termination of this Agreement.

8.3 _Termination by Pioneer Upon Failure of Financing Condition_.

(a) In the event that Pioneer terminates this Agreement on or prior to March
14, 2008 pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ solely by reason of the failure of the
condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.1(g)_ to be satisfied (a " _Phase
1 Financing Failure Termination_ "), Pioneer shall reimburse the Sellers, in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000, for their documented, out-of-
pocket fees and expenses paid to outside professional consultants and advisors
in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "). The Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to such account or accounts as the Seller Representative may designate for
disbursement to the Sellers, no later than five (5) Business Days after the
Seller Representatives delivery to Pioneer of a statement setting forth the
amount of the Expense Reimbursement together with documentation supporting the
amount claimed therein.  



 

54  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
_Section 12.15_), the Sellers right to receive payment of the
Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Sellers against Pioneer and its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents for any Losses
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and upon payment of the Expense Reimbursement following a Phase 1
Financing Failure Termination (but in no other event), none of Pioneer and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In the event that Pioneer delivers written notice to the Seller
Representative that Pioneer is extending the Closing Deadline to March 31,
2008 because the condition to the obligations of Pioneer in _Section 7.1(g)_
has not been satisfied as of March 14, 2008, then Pioneer shall pay the
Sellers a termination fee of $1,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if
Pioneer terminates this Agreement after March 14, 2008 pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ solely by reason of the failure of the condition precedent set forth
in _Section 7.1(g)_ to be satisfied (a " _Phase 2 Financing Failure
Termination_ "). The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to such account or accounts as the Seller
Representative may designate for disbursement to the Sellers, no later
than April 7, 2008. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including _Section 12.15_), the Sellers right to receive payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall be the sole

Termination, the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.3_ shall not be
applicable.

ARTICLE 9

INDEMNIFICATION 

9.1 _Risk Allocation_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made herein are intended, among other things, to allocate among
the Parties the risks inherent in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Accordingly, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to the remedies
prescribed in this Agreement by reason of any breach of any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement regardless of whether such
Indemnified Party (or any employee, representative or agent of such
Indemnified Party) knew or had reason to know of such breach, except that no
Pioneer Indemnitee shall be entitled to the remedies prescribed in this
Agreement by reason of any breach of a particular representation or warranty
if the Seller Representative can establish (with the Seller Representative
having the burden of proof) that either Wm. Stacy Locke or Joyce M. Schuldt
had actual knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, of such breach. Except
as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, the right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements will not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. With respect to any claim
for indemnification under this _Article 9_ relating to a breach of a
representation or  



 

55  warranty that contains a materiality qualifier (including "in all material
respects" and "Material Adverse Change"), such materiality qualifier will be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach of such
representation and warranty has occurred and for purposes of determining the
amount of the Losses arising out of such breach (other than the use of
"Material Adverse Change" in the first sentence of _Section 3.9_, which
shall not be disregarded).

9.2 _Survival_.

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Sellers and Pioneer set forth in this Agreement, and in any certificate
or instrument delivered at the Closing, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and continue in full force and
effect thereafter until the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date,
except that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.16_ (Employee Benefits), _Section 3.19_ (Taxes) and _Section 3.20_
(Environmental Matters) will survive until thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.7_ (Capitalization),
_Section 4.1_ (Legal Existence or Capacity), _Section 4.2_ (Due Execution;
Enforceability) and _Section 4.6_ (Title to Shares) will survive
indefinitely. No claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or
_Section 9.4_ based on the breach of a representation or warranty may be
asserted after the date on which such representation or warranty expires,
except to the extent that such claim is based on fraud in which case it may be
asserted at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable thereto. A claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.3_ or
_Section 9.4_ based on the breach of a representation or warranty that is
asserted in reasonable detail prior to the date on which such representation
or warranty expires may be maintained until such claim is finally resolved in
accordance with this _Article 9_.

(b)  _Covenants_. All covenants and agreements made by the Parties in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter for so long as such
covenants remain executory in nature.

9.3 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.6_ (including with respect to the limited liability of the
Individual Sellers), from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall be jointly
and severally obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by
reimbursement for Losses) Pioneer and its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Pioneer Indemnitees_ ")
from and against the entirety of any Loss that any Pioneer Indemnitee may
suffer that results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the nature of, or
is caused by, any one or more of the following:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 3_ (or any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by or
on behalf of any of the Sellers);

(b) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 4_ (or any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by or
on behalf of any of the Sellers);

(c) any breach or non-performance by such Seller of any covenant, agreement
or undertaking contained in this Agreement (or any certificate or instrument
delivered at the Closing by or on behalf of any of the Sellers);



 

56 (d) any claim by or through an equityholder, director, officer or employee (or
former equityholder, director, officer or employee) of any Seller, any
Acquired Company, any Affiliate of any Seller or any predecessor entity of any
of the foregoing for any payment (or alleged payment) arising out of, relating
to or resulting from the consummation of the Purchase Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any claim for any
change in control, transaction bonus, severance payment or any entitlement to
the Purchase Price (or any portion thereof or interest therein), based on any
obligation or liability arising or existing prior to the Closing;

(e) any Proceeding disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section 3.18 of
the Disclosure Schedule;

(f) any matter disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section 3.20 of the
Disclosure Schedule; and

(g) any and all Taxes imposed on any of the Acquired Companies with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date and
any and all Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Straddle Period
as provided in _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_, as applicable; _provided_
, _however_ , that the amount of any payment in respect of such a Tax under
this _Section 9.3(g)_ or any other portion of this _Section 9.3_ shall be
(i) reduced by the specific amount of any such Tax set forth as a liability
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be net of any estimated payments
made prior to the Closing to the appropriate Taxing Authority in respect of
that Tax) on the Reconciliation Statement that has become final and binding
pursuant to _Section 2.4_, and (ii) increased by the specific amount set
forth as an asset with respect to such Tax on the Reconciliation Statement
that has become final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.4_ to the extent
such amount has not been refunded (whether in cash or as a credit or offset to
another Tax) to Pioneer or an Acquired Company.

9.4 _Indemnification by Pioneer_. From and after the Closing, Pioneer shall be
obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by reimbursement
for Losses) each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") from and against the entirety of any Loss that any Seller
Indemnitee may suffer that results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the
nature of, or is caused by, any one or more of the following:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in 
_Article 5_ or any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by or on
behalf of Pioneer;

(b) any breach or non-performance by Pioneer of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement or any certificate or instrument
delivered at the Closing by or on behalf of Pioneer;

(c) any matter arising out of the operation of the Business after the Closing;
and

(d) any obligations arising under the Prior Acquisition Agreements to be paid
or performed after the Closing.

9.5 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(a) _Notice_. If any third party (including any Taxing Authority) shall make
or assert a claim against any party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ")  



 

57  with respect to any matter that may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against a party required to provide indemnification under this _Article 9_
 (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), then the Indemnified Party shall notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof promptly; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability or obligation under this
Agreement unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is
damaged or prejudiced thereby.

(b) _Defense and Settlement of Claims_. In the case of any such claim pursuant
to which only the recovery of a sum of money is being sought, the
Indemnifying Party may, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
assume the defense thereof. In such case, (i) the Indemnifying Party will
defend the Indemnified Party against such matter with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and (ii) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense.
In the event that the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or does not,
assume control of the defense of a claim pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 9.5(b)_, the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel at
its sole cost and expense to participate in such defense and, in any event,
the Indemnified Party shall (A) provide the Indemnifying Party with all
material information requested by such party relating to the defense of such
claim, (B) confer with the Indemnifying Party as to the most cost-effective
manner in which to defend such claim and (C) use its reasonable efforts to
minimize the cost of defending such claim. The Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to such matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to
be withheld unreasonably), and the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such matter
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld
unreasonably). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a claim
may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim, but the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any claim so
defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

the contrary in _Section 9.3_, no Individual Seller shall be liable to any

matter described in _Section 9.3(a)_, _Section 9.3(d)_, _Section 9.3(e)_,

(d) _Limitation on Environmental Remediation Claim_. In connection with any
claim relating to a release of Hazardous Materials requiring remediation of
real property, and subject to the other limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the Sellers liability for response action costs under
Environmental Laws shall be limited to the reasonable cost of a risk-
based remediation approach consistent with the use of the affected property
at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that for Leased Real Property, the
remediation approach shall be consistent with the requirements of the relevant
Real Property Lease and/or those set requirements established by the land
owner.



 

59 9.7 _Procedures for Assertion of Claims_.

(a) _Claim Certificate_. In connection with any claim (including any Tax
claim) for reimbursement of Losses subject to indemnification under this
_Article 9_ , including any Losses attributable to matters subject to _Section
9.5_ that are not paid by an Indemnifying Party directly to third parties, the
Party seeking reimbursement (the " _Claimant_ ") shall prepare, and deliver
to the party from which reimbursement is sought (the " _Respondent_ "), a
certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ "): (i) stating that the Claimant has
paid or sustained Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
9_ and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the Loss included in the amount so
stated.

(b) _Resolution of Claims_. As soon as practicable following the delivery of a
Claim Certificate, the Seller Representative and Pioneer shall attempt to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each claim set
forth therein. If the Seller Representative and Pioneer should so agree, a
written memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by the Seller Representative and Pioneer, and a copy of such memorandum shall
be delivered to the Claimant and the Respondent. Such memorandum and the
agreements contained therein shall be final and binding on the Seller
Representative, Pioneer, the Claimant, the Respondent and all other Persons
having any interest therein.

(c) _Failure to Resolve Objections_. If the Seller Representative and Pioneer
cannot agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
the claims in a Claim Certificate within sixty (60) days after delivery of the
Claim Certificate (as such period may be extended only by mutual written
agreement of the Seller Representative and Pioneer, by giving notice thereof
to the Claimant and the Respondent), the Claimant may pursue any and all legal
remedies that may be available to it. If an action with respect to a claim
within a Claim Certificate is not commenced in a court of competent
jurisdiction by a Claimant within sixty (60) days following the end of the
negotiation period provided in this _Section 9.7(c)_, then such claim may
not be reasserted in a separate Claim Certificate as a new claim subject to
the provisions of this _Article 9_.

(d) _Entitlement to Indemnity_. The Claimant shall be entitled to receive
payment for all amounts that (i) Respondent has agreed to pay pursuant to a
written memorandum between the Seller Representative and Pioneer pursuant to 
_Section 9.7(b)_ or (ii) the Respondent has been found liable to pay pursuant
to a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) _Payment of Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.8_, the
Respondent shall pay all amounts to which a Claimant is entitled promptly
upon demand of the Claimant by certified check or wire transfer of immediately
available funds, as the Claimant may specify.

9.8 _Recourse to Letter of Credit_. Pioneer shall be entitled to deliver a
presentation certificate (in the form attached to the Letter of Credit) to
draw under the Letter of Credit any amount to which any Pioneer Indemnitee is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 9.7(d)_. Prior to the expiration of
the Letter of Credit, Pioneer shall be required to first draw upon the Letter
of Credit for reimbursement of any amount to which Pioneer or any other
Pioneer Indemnitee is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 9.7(d)_ and
only to the extent that such claim is not satisfied thereby will such Pioneer
Indemnitee be entitled to a direct payment from the Respondent pursuant to 
_Section 9.7(e)_.



 

60 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims for specific performance of the
terms of this Agreement or claims based upon fraud, the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 9_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims from and after
the Closing relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Each Party
hereby expressly waives and releases any other claim or cause of action
arising under law, including laws based on negligence or strict liability, or
otherwise against the other party with respect to any matter, including
environmental matters, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

9.10 _Limitation on Losses_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO
THE CONTRARY, PIONEER AND THE SELLERS AGREE THAT THE RECOVERY BY ANY PARTY
HERETO OF ANY LOSSES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY IT OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY
AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH BY ANOTHER PARTY OF ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL
DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY SUCH NON-BREACHING PARTY OR OTHER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH BY THE BREACHING PARTY OF
ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER AND IN NO EVENT
SHALL THE BREACHING PARTY BE LIABLE TO SUCH NON-BREACHING PARTY OR OTHER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR
OPPORTUNITIES OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY SUCH NON-
BREACHING PARTY OR OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH BY THE
BREACHING PARTY OF ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may however, include
indirect consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages to the extent
that (a) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise to such damages
are incurred or suffered by a third party that is not an Indemnified Party or
an Affiliate of any Indemnified Party and (b) such damages are recovered
against an Indemnified Party by a third party that is not an Indemnified Party
or an Affiliate of any Indemnified Party. This _Section 9.10_ shall operate
only to limit a Partys liability and shall not operate to increase or expand
any contractual obligation of a Party hereunder or cause any contractual
obligation of a Party hereunder to survive longer than provided in _Section
9.2_.

9.11 _Subrogation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any Losses
pursuant to this _Article 9_ , the Indemnifying Party shall have subrogation
rights, to the extent of such payment, as to the Indemnified Party
with regards to any other rights, claims, causes of action, or demands that
the Indemnified Party may have to recover, in whole or in part, such Losses
from any insurance carrier or third party, including any rights or claims for
contribution, indemnity, and/or insurance. These subrogation rights in favor
of any Indemnifying Party include any rights of Pioneer and its Affiliates
under all Prior Acquisition Agreements. Furthermore, the Indemnified Parties
hereby assign all such rights to the Indemnifying Parties. For illustrative
purposes only as to the intent of this provision, if an Indemnifying Party
indemnifies an Indemnified Party for a Loss, then the Indemnifying Party will
succeed to any and all rights, claims, and causes of action that the
Indemnified Party may have to recover said Loss from any insurance carrier or
another third party. Without limiting the generality of any other provision
hereof, each Indemnified Party (a) will execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above described subrogation
rights; (b) will not take any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in the release, termination, modification or waiver of such
subrogation rights in any manner adverse to the Indemnifying Party; and (c)
will use best efforts to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in identifying,
asserting, and prosecuting all such subrogation rights as to the recovery of
any indemnified Losses, all at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party.



 

61 ARTICLE 10

TAX MATTERS

10.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

(a) As used in this Agreement:

(i) the term " _Straddle Period_ " means a Tax period or year commencing on or
before and ending after the Closing Date; and

(ii) the term " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ " means a Tax period or year ending
on or before the Closing Date or the portion of a Straddle Period that ends
on and includes the Closing Date, as the case may be.

(b) Sellers will cause each Acquired Company to be included in each
consolidated, combined affiliated, aggregate or unitary federal or state
income or franchise Tax Return which includes such Acquired Company and one or
more Sellers or one or more Affiliates of any Seller (other than any Acquired
Company) for all periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date, and Sellers shall cause to be fully paid to the appropriate taxing
authority the amount of Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return. In addition,
the parties understand that each of WEDGE Well and WEDGE Fishing is a
Disregarded Entity and, therefore, the items of income, gain, deduction, loss,
credit and other Tax items of each of WEDGE Well and WEDGE Fishing with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, for federal income Tax purposes
(and any state income Tax purposes where such state follows such federal
income Tax treatment), be included on the federal income Tax Return and
applicable state income Tax Returns of the Person who is treated, for federal
and applicable state income Tax purposes, as the owner of the assets of WEDGE
Well or WEDGE Fishing, as the case may be, with respect to such Pre-Closing
Tax Period (and shall not be included on a federal or applicable state income
Tax Return that is filed by either WEDGE Well or WEDGE Fishing) and such
Person shall be responsible for the payment of any Taxes shown as due on any
such Tax Return. The following provisions of this _Section 10.1_ shall not
apply to Tax Returns described in this _Section 10.1(b)_.

(c) Pioneer and the Seller Representative shall jointly engage
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (" _PWC_ "):

(i) to prepare each federal or state income or franchise Tax Return and each
other Tax Return covering a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is not a Straddle
Period and that is required to be filed by any Acquired Company after the
Closing Date, and

(ii) to (A) prepare each federal or state income or franchise Tax Return and
each other Tax Return covering a Straddle Period of an Acquired Company, and
(B) determine the amount of Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that would
be due from such Acquired Company in respect of the Pre-Closing Period of such
Straddle Period as if the books of the Acquired Company were closed as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

(d) Each Tax Return described in _Section 10.1(c)_ shall be prepared in
accordance with past Tax accounting practices, methods and elections used with
respect to the Tax return in question and the matters described in Section
10.1(d) of the Disclosure Schedule  



 

62  (except to the extent any such past practice, method or election or any such
matter is not, or is no longer, permissible under the applicable Tax Law),
and to the extent any items are not covered by such past practices, methods
or elections or such matters (or in the event any such past practice, method
or election or any such matter is not, or is no longer, permissible under the
applicable Tax Law), in accordance with reasonable Tax accounting practices
selected by PWC after consultation with, and with the consent of, Pioneer and
the Seller Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, no position shall be taken in any such Tax Return unless PWC, after
consultation with Pioneer and the Seller Representative, reasonably determines
that the tax treatment of such position would more likely than not be
sustained on its merits if challenged, and (i) any such determination by PWC
shall be binding on Pioneer and the Seller Representative for purposes of the
preparation of such Tax Return and (ii) no consent of Pioneer or the Seller
Representative shall be required for PWC to reflect such determination in such
Tax Return.

(e) Sellers shall pay to Pioneer the amount of Tax that is shown as due on a
Tax Return that PWC so prepares pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(i)_ and the
amount of Tax that PWC so determines is due pursuant to _Section
10.1(c)(ii)_ within five (5) days after the completion of such Tax Return or
the determination of such Tax; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of any
such payment shall be (i) reduced by the specific amount by which the Purchase
Price was reduced pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ from the inclusion of such
Tax in the definition of " _Indebtedness_ " and (ii) the specific amount of
any such Tax set forth as a liability (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be net of any estimated payments made prior to the Closing to the
appropriate Taxing Authority in respect of that Tax) on the Reconciliation
Statement that has become final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.4_, and
(ii) increased by the specific amount set forth as an asset with respect to
such Tax on the Reconciliation Statement that has become final and binding
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ to the extent such amount is not shown on such Tax
Return as an overpayment to be refunded (whether in cash or as a credit or
offset to another Tax) to Pioneer or an Acquired Company.

(f) The engagement of PWC as provided in this _Section 10.1_ shall be at the
expense of Pioneer. Each of Pioneer and the Seller Representative shall have
access to PWC and its work papers relating to any work that PWC is to do
therefor pursuant to this  _Section 10.1_. PWC shall confer with the Seller
Representative and Pioneer during the course of such work so as to permit
Seller Representative and Pioneer to comment on its work and results prior to
the completion of any Tax Return or the determination of any Tax.

10.2 _Property Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 10.1_
to the contrary, in the case of any liability for any real or personal
property Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period, the total amount of such
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
the product of (a) such Tax for the entirety of such Straddle Period,
multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days for
such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Date Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and
the balance of such Taxes shall be allocable to the Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

10.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, sales, use, registration and other
transfer Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or stock
transfer Taxes) and fees incurred in connection with the Purchase Transaction
or this Agreement shall be paid by the Sellers.

10.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns, and in connection with any audit or Proceeding,
including making employees available on a mutually convenient  



 

63  basis in connection therewith. Upon request by Pioneer, the Sellers shall
deliver to Pioneer originals or copies of all books and records within
the Sellers control with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired
Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Parties agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Party as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.5 _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Article 10_ and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Article 10_ shall control.

10.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.

10.7 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Sellers shall cause any and
all Tax sharing or allocation agreements, intercompany agreements or other
agreements or arrangements among the Acquired Companies and any other
Person(s) relating to any Tax matters to be terminated with respect to each
of the Acquired Companies as of the day before the Closing Date, and from and
after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall not be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder for any taxable period (whether past, current
or future taxable periods); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
any accrued Taxes included in the definition of Net Working Capital and
deducted from the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

10.8 _Refunds_. If Pioneer or any Acquired Company receives a refund after the
Closing Date (whether in cash or as a credit against or offset to another
Tax) of any Tax (a) attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Acquired
Company or (b) that was reflected as a liability (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall be net of any estimated payments made prior to the Closing to
the appropriate Taxing Authority in respect of that Tax) in the Reconciliation
Statement that has become final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.4_, then
Pioneer shall pay the amount of such refund (together with any interest
received thereon) to the Seller Representative within five (5) days after such
refund is received, credited, or applied as an offset; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) Pioneer shall retain any amount that was refunded (and any
interest thereon) that increased the amount paid to Sellers pursuant hereto
because such amount was reflected in the Reconciliation Statement that has
become final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.4_ as an asset of the
Acquired Company that increased Net Working Capital, and (ii) to the extent
such amount so reflected exceeds such amount that was refunded, the Sellers
shall pay to Pioneer an amount equal to such excess within five (5) days
after such excess is determined.

ARTICLE 11

Agreement that the Seller Representative may consider necessary or appropriate
in the judgment of the Seller Representative to accomplish the foregoing and
to otherwise effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

be subject to termination by operation of law, whether by the death or
incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Seller or the occurrence of
any other event or events, and the Seller Representative may not terminate
this power of attorney with respect to any Seller or such Sellers successors
or assigns without the consent of Pioneer. No bond shall be required of the

or from each Seller.

11.2 _Reliance_. The Seller Representative may rely on and shall be protected
in relying on or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Seller Representative shall not be liable for other parties
forgeries, fraud or false representations.



 

65 11.3 _Professionals; Limitation of Liability_. The Seller Representative shall
be authorized to engage, and to rely upon the advice and opinions of, legal
counsel, accountants or other administrative or professional advisors as the
Seller Representative may deem advisable to carry out its duties under this
Agreement. The Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Seller Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of legal counsel, accountants or other administrative or

is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement) of any out-of-
pocket administrative fees, costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors)
reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with the
administration of its duties under this Agreement. Each Seller also hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and
against such Sellers pro-rata share (based on the proportion of the aggregate
Purchase Price to which such Seller is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement) of any other loss, damage, liability or expense (including fees and
disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors)
that the Seller Representative may sustain as a result of any action taken by
the Seller Representative without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith in connection with the administration of its duties under this Agreement
or in connection with any dispute arising between the Sellers and Pioneer
under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no Party shall issue any such press release or make
any such statement or disclosure without the prior approval of Pioneer and
the Seller Representative (which approval shall not be unreasonably

12.6 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

12.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Texas, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

12.8 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) _WAIVER_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(b) _CERTIFICATION_. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH  



 

68  OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.8_.

12.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
each Party. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

12.10  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration
of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

12.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 8.3_ and this
_Section 12.11_, regardless of whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, each Party will bear its own expenses (including
fees and disbursements of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors
and other professional advisors) incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement (and each
of the other agreements and instruments contemplated by or executed in
connection with this Agreement) and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pioneer shall
reimburse WEDGE Parent for any incremental third-party accounting and auditing
fees and expenses incurred by WEDGE Parent and its Affiliates as a result of
the preparation of financial statements or data relating to the Business
(including, for this purpose, Phoenix and, if acquired, Prairie) necessary to
be filed by, or included in the financial statements and related schedules
of, Pioneer (" _Incremental Fees_ "); _provided_ that Pioneer shall not be
responsible for the reimbursement of any Incremental Fees unless, prior to
WEDGE Parent or its Affiliates becoming obligated to pay such Incremental
Fees, (a) WEDGE Parent notifies Pioneer of the scope and nature of the
proposed work, the terms of the engagement for such proposed work and the
estimated amount of Incremental Fees associated therewith and (b) Pioneer
approves such work and the amount of Incremental Fees to be paid therefor.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fees and expenses described in that
certain engagement letter, dated January 8, 2008, by and between Fitz Roberts
and Co., P.C. and WEDGE Energy relating to services performed for WEDGE Energy
in connection with the filing by Pioneer of its Form 8-K relating to the
Acquired Companies, constitute " _Incremental Fees_ " under this Agreement.

12.12 _Construction_. The Parties have jointly participated in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumptions or burdens of proof shall
arise favoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions
of this Agreement.  



 

69  The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has
breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

12.13 _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The exhibits and schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

12.14 _Number and Gender_. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form. Each gender-
specific term used herein has a comparable meaning whether used in a
masculine, feminine or gender-neutral form.

12.15  _Remedies_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that each
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that each
other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

12.16 _Directly or Indirectly_. Where any provision in this Agreement refers
to action to be taken by any person or entity, or that such person or entity
is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether the
action in question is taken directly or indirectly by such person or entity.

12.17 _Writings_. For purposes of the representations and warranties in
_Article 3_ , the word "writing" shall be deemed to include electronic mail.

12.18 _Including_. As used in this Agreement, the word "including" shall be
deemed to mean "including, without limitation" and, unless otherwise
expressly provided, shall not limit the words or terms preceding such word.

12.19 _Non-Business Days_. If any time period for giving notice or taking
action hereunder expires on a day that is not a Business Day, the time period
shall automatically be extended to the Business Day immediately following such
day.

12.20 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
may be executed by facsimile, photo or electronic signature and such
facsimile, photo or electronic signature shall constitute an original for all
purposes.
