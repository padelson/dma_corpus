"CLOSING DATE"). Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after the
Closing, a properly executed Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective at the time specified in the Certificate of Merger or, if
no time is specified, at the time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "EFFECTIVE Time").

         1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

         (A) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time;

         (B) the Bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time

         (C) the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time.

         1.5 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further approval of the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

         (A) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of

paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.

         (B) MERGER CONSIDERATION. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or
any Stockholder, each share of capital stock of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 1.7, the following (the "MERGER

shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Company
Shares (a "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE") is presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.

         1.7 CERTIFICATES; PAYMENT. At the Closing, each Stockholder and each
registered holder of an Original Promissory Note will deliver to Parent for

outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, whether vested or
unvested, shall terminate if not exercised in accordance with the terms of the
stock option plan of the Company.

         1.9 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

         1.10 NOTES AND PROMISSORY NOTES. At Closing, Parent shall cause the
Company to pay in immediately available funds the amounts on the Notes set forth

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

         Except as set forth on the corresponding Part or subpart of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or as expressly cross-referenced to disclosure elsewhere on
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent and Merger Sub hereby make the following
representations and warranties which are limited in scope and time as provided
herein:

         3.1 CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER.

         (A) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Florida. Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all corporate power
required to conduct its business as now conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a
material adverse effect on Parent's business, financial condition or results of
operations.

         (B) Part 3.1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule accurately sets forth
(i) the names of the members of Parent's board of directors, (ii) the names of
the members of each committee of Parent's board of directors, and (iii) the
names and titles of Parent's officers.

         3.2 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; RECORDS. Parent has
delivered to the Company accurate and complete copies of: (1) the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, including all amendments thereto, of Parent; and (2)
the minutes and other records of the meetings and other proceedings (including
any actions taken by written consent or otherwise




                                       17
<PAGE>

without a meeting) of the stockholders of Parent and the board of directors of
Parent (the items described in (1) and (2) above, collectively, the "PARENT
CONSTITUENT DOCUMENTS").

         3.3 CAPITALIZATION, ETC.

         (A) The authorized capital stock of Parent, as of the date hereof,
consists of 13,333,333 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the
"PARENT COMMON STOCK"), 6,782,938 of which are issued and outstanding; 2,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "PARENT PREFERRED
STOCK"), 268,265 of which are designated as Series C Preferred Stock of which
2,000 are issued and outstanding and convertible into 13,333 shares of Parent
Common Stock and 1,731,735 shares of which are undesignated "blank check"
preferred stock.

         (B) The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Parent
Common Stock and the Parent Preferred Stock are as stated in the articles of
incorporation of Parent. All of the outstanding Parent Common Stock and Parent
Preferred Stock is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and free of any liens or encumbrances and were issued in
compliance with the registration and qualification requirements of all
applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws.

         (C) 1,786,706 shares of Parent Common Stock are reserved for issuance
under the stock option plans of Parent and options to purchase 1,087,538 shares
are outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (stock options granted by
Parent pursuant to the stock option plans of Parent, as well as any stock
options granted outside of the stock option plans of Parent, are referred to
collectively herein as "PARENT OPTIONS.").

         (D) Except for warrants to purchase 631,395 shares of Parent Common
Stock, there are no outstanding subscriptions, warrants, options, calls, rights
of first offer, rights of first refusal, tag along rights, drag along rights, or
commitments or rights of any character relating to or entitling any person to
purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Parent directly
from Parent and there are no obligations or securities having the right to vote
on any matters on which the stockholders may vote or convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of Parent or any commitments of any
character relating to or entitling any person to purchase or otherwise acquire
any such obligations or securities from Parent. There are no stockholder
agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements, instruments or
understandings with respect to the purchase, sale or voting of the outstanding
shares of Parent capital stock to which the Parent is a party or to which any
other Person is a party. No shares of outstanding capital stock of Parent is
subject to any antidilution protections. There are no Contracts under which
Parent is obligated to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its
capital stock or register under the Securities Act of 1933, any shares of its
capital stock. Parent has not declared or paid any dividends on any shares of
its capital stock. No anti-dilution rights of any capital stock or other
securities issued by the Company shall be triggered as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of Parent has
determined that the issuance of the Parent 4% Convertible Notes is an issuance
of securities in connection with a strategic acquisition for purposes of the
warrant issued to Commonwealth Associates, L.P. and therefore no anti-dilution
adjustment is required thereto.

Agreement), to continue in effect after the consummation of the Merger and to
survive the Merger and to be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law for a period of six years from the
Effective Time.

         (B) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the

insurance and employee practices liability insurance maintained by the Company
as of the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be
obligated to make premium payments for such insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed in the aggregate $383,000.00, which amount reflects a credit

         6.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement shall survive the Merger and the
Effective Time until 5 p.m. (New York City time) on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date. The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

any present, former or future customer, creditor or vendor of the Company, (such

conduct of the business of the Company after the Effective Time; IT BEING
EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD, that the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to be

warranties have expired pursuant to Section 6.1.

<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party written notice of such claim or Legal Proceeding (a "CLAIM");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any failure on the part of any of the Indemnitees to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the Indemnitees' rights to
indemnification under this Section 6 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).

         (B) Within ten days of delivery of such written notice, the
Indemnifying Party may elect (by written notice delivered to the Indemnitee) to
take all necessary steps properly to contest any Claim involving third parties
or to prosecute such Claim to conclusion or settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party makes the foregoing election, an Indemnitee will have the right to
participate at its own expense in all proceedings. If the Indemnifying Party
does not make such election within such period or fails to diligently contest
such Claim after such election, then the Indemnitee shall be free to handle the
prosecution or defense of any such Claim, and will take all necessary steps to
contest the Claim involving third parties or to prosecute such Claim to
conclusion or settlement. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor any Indemnitee will
compromise or settle any such Claim without the written consent of the other
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
upon five-day written notice to the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party
may settle any such Claim if (i) such settlement is without monetary cost to the
Indemnified Parties, (ii) such settlement fully and finally resolves all claims
arising in such Claim as against the Indemnified Parties with prejudice, and
(iii) such settlement does not result and does not give rise to any future
obligation or other Liability (whether to perform any covenant or refrain from
engaging in any activity or otherwise) on the part of any of the Indemnified
Parties or their respective Affiliates.

         SECTION 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         7.1 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
