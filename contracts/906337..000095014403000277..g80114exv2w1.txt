approved by the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company and have been adopted and approved by Parent, as the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub, and adopted and approved by the Stockholders.  
AGREEMENT   The parties to this Agreement agree as follows:  SECTION 1.
DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION   1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
"EFFECTIVE TIME" (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the

shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.   1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "CLOSING") shall take
place at the offices of the Company at 11452 El Camino Real, San Diego, CA
92130, or at such other place as mutually agreed by the parties, on the date
of this Agreement (the "CLOSING DATE"). Contemporaneously with or as promptly
as practicable after the Closing, a properly executed Certificate of Merger
(the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") shall be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time
specified in the Certificate of Merger or, if no time is specified, at the
time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the "EFFECTIVE Time").   1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (A) The Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the

Time;   (B) the Bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time; and   (C) the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior

outstanding share of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, no par
value, of the Surviving Corporation.   (B) MERGER CONSIDERATION. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any Stockholder, each share of capital
stock of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into
the right to receive upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with

interest, set forth opposite the name of such Stockholder in ANNEX I.

bank or trust company selected by Parent as escrow agent (the "ESCROW
AGENT") in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement substantially in
the form of EXHIBIT B (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT") a Parent 4% Convertible Note
with an aggregate principal amount of $4,000,000 (the "ESCROWED PARENT 4%

Stockholder the portion of the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration set forth
opposite such Stockholder\'s name in ANNEX I with respect to all Company

Stock, whether vested or unvested, shall terminate if not exercised in
accordance with the terms of the stock option plan of the Company.   1.9
FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action
is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or
Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such
action.   1.10 NOTES AND PROMISSORY NOTES. At Closing, Parent shall cause
the Company to pay in immediately available funds the amounts on the Notes

of the Company through the Chairman of the Board or other directors of the
Company and through the "Leadership Team" of the Stockholder payers. All
properties and assets owned by the Company are owned free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except for (i) any lien for current Taxes not yet due
and payable, and (ii) liens that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and that (A) were not incurred in connection with any indebtedness,
(B) do not render property encumbered thereby unmarketable, and (C) do not

assets subject thereto or materially impair the operations of the Company
(the liens described in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as "PERMITTED
ENCUMBRANCES").   (B) OWNED REAL PROPERTY. The Company does not own any real
property.   (C) LEASED REAL PROPERTY. Part 2.6(c) of the Company

Property, including all amendments and modifications pursuant to which the
Company leases the Leased Property (the "LEASES"). The Leased Property is all
of the real property used in the business of the Company as currently
conducted. The Company has not received notice of, nor has Knowledge of,
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings pending or threatened against any
Leased Property.   (I) The Company has good marketable leasehold title to
the Leased Property, the Leases are in full force and effect and are valid,

accordance with their respective terms;   (II) No amount payable under any
Lease is past due, except amounts contested as due and owing under a
Lease;   (III) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
all covenants, commitments and obligations on their part to be performed

no failure by any other party to such Leases to comply in all material
respects with all of its commitments and obligations;   (IV) The Company
has not received any written notice of a material default (which has not been
cured), offset or counterclaim under any Lease;   (V) The Company has not
subleased, assigned, mortgaged, pledged or otherwise encumbered its interest
under any Lease or entered into any license, sublease or occupancy agreement
with respect to any Leased Property, nor has the Company entered into any
agreement or commitment to take any such action;   (VI) To the Knowledge of
the Company, all Improvements owned, leased, or used by the Company on the
Leased Property are in reasonably good condition and repair in all material

accurately sets forth (i) the names of the members of Parent\'s board of
directors, (ii) the names of the members of each committee of Parent\'s board

liens or encumbrances and were issued in compliance with the registration and
qualification requirements of all applicable federal, state and foreign
securities laws.   (C) 1,786,706 shares of Parent Common Stock are reserved
for issuance under the stock option plans of Parent and options to purchase
