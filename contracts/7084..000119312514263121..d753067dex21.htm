    5.2 | Locked Box Covenant 
---|--- 

In addition to the Locked Box Guarantee, the Sellers shall procure that,
during the period from the Signing Date until the Closing Date and except with
the consent of the Purchasers, no Leakage other than Permitted Leakage occurs
that will not have been remedied prior to or on the Closing Date (the _Locked
Box Covenant_ ).



   5.3 | Leakage Notice; Breach of Locked Box Guarantee or Covenant 
---|--- 



   5.3.1 | The Sellers shall provide to the Purchasers no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a written confirmation stating the
amount of Leakage (if any) that has occurred since the Effective Date until
and including the date preceding the date on which the written notice is made
(the _Leakage Notice_ ). 
---|--- 



   5.3.2 | If the Sellers were to breach the Locked Box Guarantee or the
Locked Box Covenant (the _Leakage Breach_ ), they shall, in a proportion of
65% by HPW and 35% by KKR, or in the proportion that the Sellers
may otherwise determine or that is determined in accordance with Section 5.4,
reimburse the Target or the relevant WILD Flavors Company on a Euro-for-Euro
basis an amount equal to the amount of Leakage constituting the Leakage Breach
at the latest on the Closing Date (or, if for whatever reason such Leakage
amounts have not been reimbursed on or before the Closing Date, then, subject
to Section 8.5, following Closing). 
---|--- 
 



   5.3.3 | Instead of the reimbursement pursuant to Section 5.3.2, the
relevant Seller may, at its sole discretion, in the Leakage Notice allow, but
not require, the Purchasers to offset the amount of Leakage constituting
the Leakage Breach set out in the Leakage Notice against the Purchase Price
attributable to the relevant Seller ( _i.e_. HPW Purchase Price or KKR
Purchase Price). 
---|--- 
 



   5.4 | Procedure 
---|--- 

To the extent that the Sellers do not, be it jointly or
individually, reimburse the Target or the relevant WILD Flavors Company for
Leakage Breaches on the Closing Date and such amounts are not offset against
the Purchase Price, the Purchasers shall be entitled to demand full
reimbursement from either or both of Sellers in each case up to the full
amount of such Leakage but, ultimately, each Seller shall be liable only to
the extent he/it is held responsible according to the procedure described
below. Any arbitration proceedings in regard to such reimbursement may be
initiated and conducted as proceedings against both Sellers for the payment by
both of them of the full amount. In addition, if and to the extent
procedurally possible, the Purchasers shall request the arbitration tribunal
to determine whether one of the Sellers was solely responsible for the
Leakage Breach and, if not, to what extent each of

5 July 2014

  30  | 76



 

 the Sellers was so responsible, in all cases adding up to 100% and the full
amount of the Leakage Breach. The Sellers undertake to reimburse the amount of
the Leakage Breach to the Purchasers in the proportions determined by the
arbitration tribunal, it being understood and agreed that each Seller shall be
liable towards the Purchasers only for the portion of the Leakage Breach for
which such Seller has been found responsible (which can be up to 100% of such
Leakage Breach). In the event that the requested determination is procedurally
not possible or the arbitration tribunal cannot or does not make the
determination, the Sellers shall reimburse the Purchasers in the proportion of
65% by HPW and 35% by KKR as to the Leakage Breach.

reasonable cooperation and assistance as set forth herein, ensure that
any filings required in connection with the Merger Control Clearance and to
be made with any Merger Control Authority or Governmental Authority, to the
extent they have not already been made prior to the Signing Date, will be made
without undue delay after the Signing Date and in compliance with the
applicable time periods (including any extensions) under the applicable laws
and regulations. Such filings shall be made by the Purchasers on behalf of the
Parties and the Target (save where mandatory law requires the Sellers or the
Target to make the filing, in which case Sellers shall do so), provided,
however, that each of the Purchasers and the Sellers (as the case may be)
shall provide the other Parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on
all filings and other material relevant correspondence, including any
documents or other written (or material oral) communications before they are
sent out to such Merger Control Authority or Governmental Authority. However,
each Party reserves the right to file confidential information about its

      |  shortest time period possible; provided that the Purchasers
shall be entitled to lead and exercise ultimate authority and control over all
strategy, discussions, negotiations, submissions and proceedings. The
Purchasers (or the Sellers) may withdraw ( _zur ucknehmen_) filings made with
any Merger Control Authority or Governmental Authority or agree with any
Merger Control Authority or Governmental Authority on the extension of any
examination period only with the express prior written consent of the Sellers
(or Purchasers), such consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld. 
---|--- 



   6.4.4 | Except as provided herein, the Purchasers shall without undue
delay take any and all action necessary, required or advisable to obtain the
Merger Control Clearance from any Merger Control Authority or
Governmental Authority without undue delay and any and all action necessary,
proper or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or
threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any
Merger Control Authority or Governmental Authority that would delay, enjoin,
prevent, restrain, or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Transaction
including but not limited to accepting the imposition of and complying with
any conditions and obligations required by any Merger Control Authority or
Governmental Authority in order to obtain Merger Control Clearance. 
---|--- 



   6.4.5 | In the event that any Merger Control Authority or Governmental
Authority requires (the _Requirement_ ) the Purchasers to agree to offer to
sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or
impair any businesses, assets or properties located in jurisdictions other
than Germany or the U.S. of the Target or any WILD Flavors Company (the
_Retained Assets_ ), the Purchasers shall be entitled, but not obligated,
to elect that the Sellers agree to, and implement, acting in good faith, a
mechanism whereby one or both of the Sellers retain and hold separate for the
Purchasers, or transfer to a third party designated by the Purchasers, the
Retained Assets, in whole or in part, to the extent legally permissible
pursuant to appropriate contractual arrangements that reflect the commercial
goals of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the _Hold Separate
Agreements_ ), which Hold Separate Agreements the Purchasers shall be
entitled to amend at any time and the Sellers will cooperate in order to
effect the implementation of any such amendments. 
---|--- 
 

The Purchasers shall, at all times, be entitled to dispose of the Retained
Assets subject to the reimbursement of the Sellers of any external costs and
expenses including any out-of-pocket costs and any liabilities thereby
incurred by the Sellers. If the Purchasers exercise their right as aforestated

 



EXECUTION COPY Project Kronos

 

5 July 2014

  35  | 76



 

 and the Parties enter into Hold Separate Agreements, then (i) on the Closing
Date, the Purchase Price shall be paid in full and the Shares shall be
transferred to the Purchasers, and (ii) the Parties shall give each other
prompt notice if the Requirement is withdrawn, in which case the Sellers
shall, without undue delay, transfer full title and control over the Retained
Assets to the Purchasers; the allocation of the Retained Assets as between
the Purchasers shall be as reasonably directed by the Purchasers. If the
Purchasers do not exercise their right as aforestated, and the Parties fail to
agree on a Hold Separate Agreement for the relevant Retained Assets, or such
a Hold Separate Agreement is not legally feasible or sufficient to address the
requirements of the relevant Merger Control Authority, the Purchasers shall
agree, subject to the next following sentence, to offer to sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair, first
the Retained Assets and then any assets or properties of the Purchasers
(including for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or other interests in the
Target) in order to satisfy the Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchasers
shall not be required to agree to offer to sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair (i), directly or
indirectly, any assets or properties of the Target or any WILD Flavors Company
located in the U.S. or Germany, or (ii) any assets or properties of
the Purchasers (including for the avoidance of doubt, any equity or other
interests in the Target) to the extent such assets have a value in excess of
EUR 50,000,000 (in words: fifty million Euros). In all cases, the Sellers will
reasonably cooperate to achieve to the extent possible the intentions
expressed in this Section 6.4.5.



   6.4.6 | The Purchasers shall ensure that neither the Purchasers nor any
of the Purchasers Affiliates will, prior to the Closing Date, enter into any
acquisition, merger or similar business transaction which may prevent, delay
or interfere with the Merger Control Clearance (except for the WDI
Transaction). The Sellers shall not, and shall ensure that the Target and the
WILD Flavors Companies will not, enter into any acquisition, merger or similar
business transaction that may prevent, delay or interfere with the Merger
Control Clearance. 
---|--- 



   6.4.7 | If the consummation of the Closing is prohibited by any Merger
Control Authority of any jurisdiction other than the European Union or the
U.S., upon Sellers reasonable request, the Parties shall without
delay contest such decision (including by way of litigation).

In the event of any breach or non-fulfilment by the Sellers of any of the
Sellers Guarantees or covenants pursuant to Section 10 ( _Ordinary Course of
Business Covenant_ ) or any other guarantee, covenant or undertaking of the
Sellers under this Agreement (collectively the _Purchasers  Claims_, each of
them a _Purchasers  Claim_, which definition for purposes of defining
recoverable damages or limitation of Sellers liability shall not include
liabilities under Section 2 through Section 6, Section 11 and any obligations
or liabilities relating to periods subsequent to Closing), the Purchasers are
entitled to demand from the Sellers (i) that the Sellers put the Purchasers,
or at the choice of the Purchasers, the Target or the respective WILD Flavors
Company, into the position the Purchasers or the Target or the respective
WILD Flavors Company would have been in had the guarantee, covenant or
undertaking not been breached (restitution in kind; _Naturalrestitution_ ), or
(ii) that the Sellers pay an amount sufficient to compensate all damages
suffered by the Purchasers, the Target or the respective WILD Flavors Company
in connection with such breach or non-fulfilment and recoverable by the
Purchasers under this Agreement. If the Sellers fail to achieve such position
within sixty (60) Business Days after having been notified in reasonable
detail by the Purchasers of the potential breach or measure, or if the breach
is not subject to restitution in kind, the Purchasers or, at the Purchasers
choice, the Target or the respective WILD Flavors Company, shall be entitled
to claim monetary damages ( _Schadensersatz in Geld_ ), provided, however,
that such damages shall only cover actual damages suffered directly by the
Purchasers or the Target or the respective WILD Flavors Company, and shall in
particular not cover (i) internal administration or overhead costs of the
Purchasers, the Target or a WILD Flavors Company, as the case may be, (ii)
consequential damages ( _Folgesch aden_) or lost profits _(_ _entgangener
Gewinn_ ), (iii) frustrated expenses ( _vergebliche Aufwendungen_ ), (iv) any

arguments that the Purchase Price was calculated upon incorrect assumptions,
and further provided that for any Purchasers Claim resulting from a
defective or non-existent title to, the non-existence of, an encumbrance or
other right over the Shares, the shares or interests in the Target or any WILD
Flavors Company, monetary damages shall be calculated on the basis of the

Company, as the case may be.

the Parties.

be entitled to any Purchasers Claim, whether for restitution in kind or for

not limited to, through insurance policies maintained by the Target and/or
the WILD Flavors Companies;

Purchasers with a good faith estimate of the aggregate expected costs,
expenses and liabilities. If the aggregate expected costs, expenses and
liabilities were to exceed EUR 10,000,000 (in words: ten million Euros), the
Purchasers are entitled, at their election, (i) to require the Sellers to use
their best efforts to cause the Target or the relevant WILD Flavors Company
to carry out such action, insofar as it is lawful to do so, in which case the
Indemnity shall apply in respect of the full amount, or (ii) to determine that
Section 6.6 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_. For the avoidance of doubt,
any claims of the Sellers, the Target or any WILD Flavors Company under this
Section 11.1.2 shall not be subject to the limitations (including, without
limitation, the De Minimis Amount and the Threshold Amount) set forth in
Section 8\. In the event the Sellers fail, or fail to cause the Target or the
relevant WILD Flavors Company, to carry out such requested actions, the
business operations, activities, assets, personnel, rights and obligations
that are the subject of such requested actions shall be excluded from the
Transaction and shall be retained by HPW or at his option by one of HPWs
Affiliates, in which case HPW shall be the beneficiary of the Indemnity in
respect of costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by him, unless reimbursed
by the Target or any WILD Flavors Company. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in
such a case, the Purchasers shall not have purchased, obtained or assumed, and
shall not be obligated to purchase, obtain or assume, whether directly or
indirectly, any such business operations, activities, assets, personnel,
rights or obligations, and (ii) the Purchasers shall not be entitled to any
reduction or adjustment of the Purchase Price, or any Purchasers Claim,
on the basis that such business operations, activities, assets, personnel,
rights or obligations are not (or no longer are) part of the WILD Flavors
Business.

monthly management reports for the Target and the WILD Flavors Companies.



   11.3 | Covenant with regard to the Targets Tax Status 
---|--- 



   11.3.1 | To the extent permissible under applicable laws and without
any liability owed to the Sellers and any of their Affiliates, the Purchasers
will instruct the Target after the Closing to: 
---|--- 
 



     | (1) | not make an election in a Swiss Tax Return to be treated as
(A) a Swiss holding company pursuant to Section 68 of the Tax Act of the
Canton Zug ( _Steuergesetz des Kantons Zug_ ) or (B) a so-called mixed
company ( _gemischte Gesellschaft_ ) pursuant to Section 69 of the Tax Act of
the Canton Zug ( _Steuergesetz des Kantons Zug_ ) (any such election referred
to under (A) or (B) above, a _Swiss Holding Tax Election_ ) for the fiscal
year 2014 and, if Closing were to occur in the fiscal year 2015, for the
fiscal year 2015, and 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | not make a Swiss Holding Tax Election for the fiscal year
2013. 
---|---|--- 

The Purchasers shall (i) send a copy of the relevant Swiss Tax Returns of the
Target for the fiscal year 2014 and, if Closing were to occur in the fiscal
year 2015, for the fiscal year 2015 to KKR prior to the Target filing such
Swiss Tax Returns, and (ii) make available to KKR a copy of a relevant
document from the Tax authorities of the Canton Zug showing the Tax status of
the Target, which KKR reasonably needs for establishing KKRs Luxembourg
corporate income tax status in relation to the sale of the Shares pursuant to
this Agreement, provided that Purchasers may redact all information in any
document which may not be relevant in this respect. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchasers, the Target and their Affiliates shall have no legal
obligation or liability vis-a-vis the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with
respect to any action, omission, information or otherwise under, or in
connection with, this Section 11.3.1.

    11.3.2 | KKR shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers and the
Target against all Taxes and other costs, expenses and liabilities resulting
from one or more of the following: 
---|--- 
 



     | (1) | the fact that the Target (i) has not made the Swiss Holding
Tax Election for the fiscal year 2013 or (ii) will not make a Swiss Holding
Tax Election for the fiscal year 2013 after Closing; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | the fact that the Target has not made, or will not make, a
Swiss Holding Tax Election for the fiscal year 2014 and/or, if Closing were to
occur in the year 2015, for the fiscal year 2015; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (3) | in case Closing occurs in 2014, the fact that the Target is,
as a result of a filing prior to Closing, precluded, or otherwise not legally
permitted, to make a Swiss Holding Tax Election for the fiscal year 2015.  
---|---|--- 

Claims of the Purchasers and the Target under this Section 11.3 shall not be
subject to the limitations (including, without limitation, the De Minimis
Amount and the Threshold Amount) set forth in Section 8, except that such
claims under this Section 11.3 shall count towards, and shall be subject to,
the KKR Liability Portion as defined in Section 8.2.2. Claims of the
Purchasers and the Target under this Section 11.3 shall become time-barred (
_verj ahren_) eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date.

 

If and to the extent that the respective Tax assessments for the respective
fiscal year are not issued within fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date,
claims of the Purchasers and the Target under this Section 11.3 in relation to
Taxes shall be finally and conclusively determined and payable based on the
expected future Tax liabilities as reflected in the respective Swiss Tax
Return duly prepared and filed by the Target in compliance with applicable
Swiss Tax laws, irrespective of whether such Tax liabilities have already been
assessed or are due or payable and irrespective of whether the respective Tax
assessments following such Swiss Tax Returns deviate from such Tax Returns.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.3 shall apply irrespective of the
Purchasers or the Targets actions, measures or transactions in the
respective fiscal years.



   11.3.3 | Section 203 BGB shall not apply with respect to the limitation
periods stipulated in Section 11.3.2, unless the Parties agree in writing that
the expiry period shall be tolled ( _gehemmt_ ).

    11.4 | WILD Intellectual Property Rights 
---|--- 

Except as provided in this Section 11.4, HPW will not, and will ensure that
the HPW Affiliates (other than the Target, the WILD Flavors Companies and, if
Closing of this Agreement and closing of the WDI Transaction occur together,
other than WDI) will not use the Intellectual Property Rights after the
Closing. HPW and the HPW Affiliates may, however, continue the use of
trademarks in the manner and to the extent used on the Signing Date, on (i)
letterheads, other stationery, on the internet and websites for a period of
twelve (12) months from the Closing Date; (ii) inventory on stock at Closing
for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, and (iii) external
signs on buildings and vehicles for a period of twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date. Upon the reasonable request of HPW, the Purchasers shall at
their discretion consider an extension of the aforementioned time periods.

 

SECTION 12

 

HPWS NON-COMPETE COVENANT

 



   12.1 | HPWs Non-Compete Covenant 
---|--- 

For a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date, HPW shall
refrain, and shall procure that HPWs Affiliates refrain from competing,
directly or indirectly, with the Target and the WILD Flavors Companies in
respect of the WILD Flavors Business, in jurisdictions in which the Target
and the WILD Flavors Companies currently operate or conduct their business, as
conducted by the Target and the WILD Flavors Companies as of the Closing Date
(including projects and planned launches of new products as set forth in the
business plan for the WILD Flavors Business for the fiscal year 2014, the
respective RandD business plans for any of WILD Flavor Companies or the budget
of the WILD Flavors Business for the fiscal year 2014). This undertaking shall
include, without limitation, that HPW and HPWs Affiliates shall not (i) act
as director, officer, employee, consultant, contractor or otherwise for a
competitor of the WILD Flavors Business, or (ii) hold, directly or indirectly,
any shareholding or equivalent interest in a competitor of the WILD Flavors
Business (excluding HPWs existing ownership in Dallant, Spain), except for
shares in publicly listed corporations which represent a capital participation
of less than fifteen (15) per cent, or (iii) influence or attempt to
influence any customer, supplier, employee, consultant or other third party
maintaining a contractual or other business relationship with any

5 July 2014

  64  | 76



 

 WILD Flavors Company to terminate or discontinue such contractual or other
business relationship or to reduce the volume of goods or services provided
thereunder other than by exercising contractual rights. The foregoing
limitations shall not apply to (x) any business activities of HPW or his
Affiliates as conducted on the Signing Date and on the Closing Date (including
any activities of the WILD Flavors Business to be retained by HPW or any of
his Affiliates pursuant to Section 11.1.2), (y) the manufacturing or
production by any other business owned or controlled by HPW, including for the
avoidance of doubt the Capri Sun business, of any base compounds for flavors
for use in end-products produced by them, or their licensees provided such
end-products, but none of the compounds are distributed to their or their
licensees customers (business-to-customer relationship).

 



   12.2 | Specific Performance 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that in case of a breach of the non-compete covenants set
forth in Section 12.1, the remedies available to the Purchasers under this
Agreement are not sufficient to hold the Purchasers, the Target and the WILD
Flavors Companies fully harmless against the detriments suffered
therefrom, and that, therefore, the Purchasers shall be entitled to enforce
any claims for specific performance of the non-compete obligation (
_Unterlassungs- und Beseitigungsanspr uche_) through injunctive relief (
_einstweiliger Rechtsschutz_ ). 



   12.3 | Additional Remedy 
---|--- 

In each case of a breach by HPW or any of his Affiliate of the non-compete
covenant set forth in Section 12.1, HPW shall pay to the Purchasers (and/or,
at the Purchasers discretion, to the Target or any WILD Flavors Company) for
each breach a contractual penalty ( _Vertragsstrafe_ ) in the amount of EUR
200,000 (in words: two hundred thousand Euros). In the event of continuing
violation, for each additional month that the violation continues, HPW shall
pay a further contractual penalty in the amount of EUR 200,000 (in words:
two hundred thousand Euros).

HPWS NON-SOLICITATION COVENANT

 

HPW shall not, and shall procure that HPWs Affiliates do not, from the
Signing Date until the expiry of a period of twenty-four (24) months
following the Closing Date, solicit, encourage or induce any employees of the
Target or a WILD Flavors Company except for the current Head of Strategic
Development (such employees hereinafter collectively referred to as the 
_Employees_ and each of them as an _Employee_ ) to leave the employment of the
Target or any of the WILD Flavors Companies. Solicitation, encouragement or
inducement shall be deemed to have occurred if an Employee is employed by HPW
or one of HPWs Affiliates, unless the employment followed an unsolicited
approach by that person on his own instigation or in response to an
advertisement or otherwise by means not specifically directed towards the
Employee.

 

SECTION 14

 

UNTERSTÜTZUNGSKASSE



   14.1 | Pension Obligations of RWKG operated by Unterstutzungskasse 
---|--- 

The Parties shall use their best efforts to find a mutual agreement regarding
the future operation of the pension obligations of RWKG which are currently
operated through the Unterstutzungskasse der Rudolf-Wild-Werke e.V. (the
_WILD Unterst utzungskasse_) between the Signing Date and the Closing Date.
In particular the Parties shall assess the following options: (i) operation of
the pension obligations of RWKG through a new support fund ( _Unterst
utzungskasse_), (ii) operation of the pension obligations of RWKG based on a
direct pension grant ( _Direktzusage_ ) and secured by a contractual trust
arrangement, or (iii) continuing the operation of the pension obligations
through WILD Unterstutzungskasse.



   14.2 | Operation of RWKG Pension Scheme outside of the
Unterstutzungskasse 
---|--- 

If continuing the operation of pension obligations by WILD
Unterstutzungskasse is not agreed between the Parties, the Parties further
agree to, and shall procure, to the extent possible, that RWKG is released
from participation in the WILD Unterstutzungskasse and agree that the funds
allocated to RWKG are transferred from the WILD Unterstutzungskasse to RWKG or
an alternative funding vehicle as reasonably requested by RWKG and permitted
under statutory requirements, in particular to such alternative funding
vehicles as described in Section 14.1.

Business.

With effect as of the Closing Date, the Sellers hereby release, and
shall procure that the Sellers Affiliates release, the directors, officers
and the employees of the Target and the WILD Flavors Companies from any and
all liabilities and other legal obligations of such director, officers and
employees towards the Seller and the Sellers Affiliates on any legal basis
which is in any manner related to the subject matter of this Agreement or the

If and to the extent a Tax Authority assesses a Tax liability vis-a-vis
either the Purchasers or the Target or a WILD Flavors Company which is (A)
owed by HPW or any of his Affiliates, excluding the Target and any WILD
Flavors Company, (B) attributable to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date and (C) based on the application of
section 75 of the German Fiscal Code ( _Abgabenordnung_ ) or comparable rules
(including Tax provisions relating to secondary liabilities for
withholding taxes), HPW shall hold harmless and indemnify the Purchasers or
the Target or the relevant WILD Flavors Company from such Tax liability,
unless and to the extent the Target or the relevant WILD Flavors Company is

referred to in Section 17.1.1 is required by law or regulation, such
disclosure may be made by the Party which has been addressed, but only upon
advice of its legal counsel and to the extent legally permissible and

---|--- 



     | (1) | having informed the other Parties without undue delay about
the existence and scope of such obligation and the circumstances under which
the obligation has been imposed upon it; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | ensuring the confidential treatment of such information
disclosed to the relevant public authority, court or regulatory body;

shareholders, KKR funds or fund investors as is necessary to enable
such persons to comply with their contractual, statutory or regulatory
reporting and compliance obligations (including those of any relevant stock
exchange or governmental or regulatory authorities or agencies), provided that
any such disclosure shall be limited to that required to comply with such
obligations and, to the extent legally permissible, shall be made subject to
reasonable obligation of confidentiality. 
---|--- 
 



   17.2 | Purchasers Confidentiality; Return of Documents 
---|--- 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated or will terminate without the

return all documents and information embodied otherwise received from the

    22.8 | Severability 
---|--- 



   22.8.1 | Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid,
ineffective or unenforceable as a whole or in part, the validity,
effectiveness and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be
affected thereby. Any such invalid, ineffective or unenforceable provision
shall be deemed replaced by such valid, effective and enforceable provision as
comes closest to the economic intent and the purpose of such invalid,
ineffective or unenforceable provision as regards subject-matter, amount,
time, place and extent. The Parties are aware of the Federal Supreme Courts (
_Bundesgerichtshof_ ) case law, whereby a severability clause merely reverses
the burden of proof. However, it is the express intention of the Parties to
maintain the validity of the remaining provisions at all events and thus to
exclude the applicability of Section 139 BGB as a whole. 
---|--- 
 



   22.8.2 | The aforesaid shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any gap in
this Agreement.
