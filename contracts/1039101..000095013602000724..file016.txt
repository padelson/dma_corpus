the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.4, a schedule setting forth
a proposed allocation of the Tax Purchase Price among the Sellers. The Buyer
shall deliver to Raytheon, within 30 days after delivery of such allocation
schedule, either a notice indicating that the Buyer accepts such allocation
schedule or a statement detailing its objections to such allocation schedule.
If the Buyer delivers to Raytheon a notice accepting Raytheon\'s allocation
schedule, or if the Buyer does not deliver a written objection within such
30-day period, then, effective as of either the date of delivery of such
notice of acceptance or as of the close of business on such 30th day, such
allocation schedule shall be deemed to be accepted by the Buyer. If the Buyer
timely objects to Raytheon\'s schedule and the Buyer and Raytheon cannot
reach agreement on such allocation within 15 days following the date that the
Buyer notified Raytheon of the objection, then the Buyer and Raytheon shall
jointly engage a mutually agreeable "big five" accounting firm (other than
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) (the "Neutral Accountant"). If the Neutral
Accountant determines that the allocation schedule provided by Raytheon was
reasonable, such allocation schedule shall be final. If the Neutral
Accountant determines that the allocation schedule provided by Raytheon was
unreasonable, the Neutral Accountant shall prepare the allocation schedule
based upon appraisal of the fair value of the assets among which the Tax
Purchase Price is to be allocated and such appraisal shall be determined
by an independent appraisal firm. The Buyer and Raytheon agree to provide to
the    11   Neutral Accountant such information as the Neutral
Accountant may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of such
schedule and shall request that the Neutral Accountant prepare and deliver to
Raytheon and the Buyer such allocation schedule as promptly as practicable.
The Buyer and Raytheon shall share equally the costs and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant and the independent appraisal firm for its services under
this Section 1.2(b)(i).   (ii) Within 30 days following the final
determination of the allocation of the Tax Purchase Price among the Sellers
in accordance with clause (i) above, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Raytheon a schedule with respect to each Seller setting forth a proposed
allocation of the portion of the Tax Purchase Price allocated to such Seller
pursuant to clause (i) above among the Acquired Assets that were acquired
from such Seller and the covenant contained in Section 10.2 hereof in
accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule
so proposed by the Buyer shall be final unless Raytheon in good faith objects
to such Allocation Schedule within 30 days after receiving the Allocation
Schedule from the Buyer. If Raytheon timely objects to the Allocation
Schedule and the Buyer and Raytheon cannot reach an agreement on the
Allocation Schedule within 15 days following the date that Raytheon notified
the Buyer of the objection, then the Buyer and Raytheon shall jointly engage
the Neutral Accountant. If the Neutral Accountant determines that the
Allocation Schedule provided by the Buyer was reasonable, the
Allocation Schedule shall be final. If the Neutral Accountant determines that
the Allocation Schedule provided by the Buyer was unreasonable, the
Neutral Accountant shall prepare the Allocation Schedule based upon appraisal
of the fair value of the assets among the assets to which the Tax Purchase
Price is to be allocated and such appraisal    12   shall be determined
by an independent appraisal firm. The Buyer and Raytheon agree to provide the
Neutral Accountant with such information as the Neutral Accountant may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Allocation
Schedule and shall request that the Neutral Accountant prepare and deliver to
the Buyer and Raytheon such Allocation Schedule as promptly as possible. The
Buyer and Raytheon shall share equally the costs and expenses of the Neutral
Accountant and the independent appraisal firm for its services under this
Section 1.2(b)(ii).   (iii) The Buyer and the Sellers agree that amounts
payable to any parties pursuant to the agreements set forth in clauses (x)
through (xxii) of Section 1.3(b) were separately agreed upon and represent
arm\'s length payments for the goods and services to be provided thereunder.
Accordingly, no portion of the Tax Purchase Price is properly allocable to
such agreements or the goods or services provided thereunder.   (iv) The
final determination of the Allocation Schedule shall be used by each party in
preparing any filings required pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code or any
similar provisions of state or local law and all relevant income and
franchise Tax Returns. Neither the Buyer nor any Seller shall take a position
before any taxing authority or in any judicial proceeding that
is inconsistent with such Allocation Schedule without the prior written
consent of the other Party. The Parties shall in good faith exercise
reasonable efforts to support such Allocation Schedule in any audit
proceedings initiated by any taxing authorities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Allocation Schedule has not been finally determined in
accordance with this Section 1.2(b) by the time (taking into account all
applicable extensions) that any Seller, the Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates is required to file any Tax Return    13   reflecting an
allocation of the Tax Purchase Price between the Sellers and/or among the
Acquired Assets and the covenant contained in Section 10.2 hereof, such party
shall be entitled to file such Tax Return based upon an allocation of the Tax
Purchase Price that reflects (i) any allocation pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(i)
that has become final, (ii) any allocation to any item pursuant to Section
1.2(b)(ii) hereof upon which the Parties have agreed or with respect to which
the 30-day period for objecting has passed with no objection having been made
by Raytheon to the allocation to the item and (iii) an allocation of
any remaining amounts based upon a good faith determination by such party of
the respective fair market values of the Acquired Assets, provided that
such allocation is not inconsistent with any allocations specified in clauses
(i) and (ii) of this sentence.   1.3 The Closing.   (a) Time and
Location. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
("Closing") shall take place at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP in Boston,
Massachusetts, commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on February 28, 2002 or,

referred to in clauses (iii) through (xxii) above are referred to herein as
the "Ancillary Agreements."   1.4 Post-Closing Adjustment. The Purchase
Price set forth in Section 1.2(a) shall be subject to adjustment after the
Closing Date as follows:   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Target
Net Tangible Book Value" shall be $475,200,000. Such figure is $25,000,000 in
excess of the figure derived from the Most Recent Balance Sheet in the manner
shown on Schedule 1.4.   (b) Within 75 days after the Closing Date, Raytheon
shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement")
that is prepared in accordance with GAAP (provided that in the event of any
inconsistency between GAAP and the methodologies described below, the
methodologies described below shall control) and that sets forth the Acquired
Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing (without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and also showing the excess
of the Acquired Assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, over
the Assumed Liabilities as shown thereon (the "Closing Net Tangible Book
Value"), together with a special purpose audit report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP which shall state that the Closing Statement
fairly presents, in all material respects, the Acquired Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing Date on a basis consistent with
this Section 1.4. All fees, costs and expenses of the services rendered
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement shall be borne by the Sellers. Subject to the methodologies
and procedures described in the balance of    18   this Section 1.4(b),
the Closing Statement shall be prepared using the same accounting principles,
practices, procedures, policies and methods, with consistent classifications,
judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies,
that were employed in the preparation of the balance sheet attached as
Schedule 1.4 and the derivation of the Target Net Tangible Book Value. Except
as specifically provided in the following sentence, (A) the Closing Net
Tangible Book Value, and any difference between the Target Net Tangible Book
Value and the Closing Net Tangible Book Value, shall not reflect any of the
following items: (i) the effect of any changes to estimates used to prepare
the Most Recent Balance Sheet (it being agreed that increases in percentage
of completion resulting from normal cost-to-cost accounting applied to
additional contract expenditures shall not be considered estimates
for purposes of this section), (ii) any changes in or adjustments to the
reserves or estimates at completion used in the preparation of the balance
sheet attached as Schedule 1.4, (iii) deferred tax asset or liability
accounts, or (iv) any changes in any of the assets or liabilities of the AIS
Business between the Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Date, and (B) all
estimates at completion, contract profit rates and loss or other reserves
associated with contracts in process used in the preparation of the balance
sheet attached as Schedule 1.4 shall be the same in Schedule 1.4 and in the
Closing Statement, and any associated impacts on any other accounts which
change based on a change in such estimates at completion, contract profit
rates and loss or other reserves shall be ignored. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the following items and changes shall be taken into
account in preparing the Closing Statement: (i) all amounts of any reserve or
valuation accounts shall be reduced for any cash payments with respect to
such reserve and valuation accounts after the Balance Sheet Date; (ii)
changes shall be made to any    19   reserves or valuation accounts
relating to depreciation of physical assets to the extent that such changes
are required by the passage of time after the Balance Sheet Date; (iii)
estimates at completion, contract profit rates and loss and other reserves
associated with contracts in process used in the preparation of the Most
Recent Balance Sheet may be revised from the amount used in such preparation
for, and only for, the occurrence of a Third Party Event, and only to the
extent of the impact of that Third Party Event; and (iv) changes to other
components of the Acquired Assets (excluding goodwill and other intangible
assets and excluding estimates at completion, contract profit rates and loss
or other reserves associated with contracts in process used in
the preparation of the balance sheet attached as Schedule 1.4) and the
Assumed Liabilities that result from the operation of the AIS Business
between the Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Date shall be reflected. A
"Third Party Event" is an event that (i) occurs between the Balance Sheet
Date and the Closing, (ii) is communicated to a Seller on or prior to the
date 30 days after the Closing Date, from a source outside the personnel,
premises and operations of the Sellers, and (iii) states a claim or provides
notice of a condition, the financial statement effect of which is probable of
occurrence and reasonably stated or estimable, and would therefore require,
under GAAP, the revision, upward or downward, of a contract reserve or
estimate at completion in the absence of the other provisions of this Section
1.4. For the purposes of the previous sentence only, "communicated" shall
mean the receipt by a Seller of a written notice from a customer,
Governmental Entity, subcontractor or third-party vendor. The intent of the
Buyer and the Sellers with regard to the methodologies described above is to
prohibit a Purchase Price adjustment with respect to changes in estimates at
completion and/or    20   views of risks, opportunities or judgments
with respect to agreements existing as of September 30, 2001, except upon the
occurrence of a Third Party Event.   (c) Upon receipt of the Closing
Statement by the Buyer, the Buyer and the Buyer\'s independent accountants
shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to the Closing
Statement working papers of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the extent
reasonably required to complete review of the Closing Statement. The Buyer
shall deliver to Raytheon, within 30 days after delivery by Raytheon to the
Buyer of the Closing Statement, either a notice indicating that the Buyer
accepts the Closing Statement or a statement describing the
Buyer\'s objections to the Closing Statement, which statement of objections
shall describe in reasonable detail the specific nature and amount of each
objection and shall state in reasonable detail all bases upon which the Buyer
believes the Closing Statement is not in conformity with the requirements set
forth in Section 1.4(b). If the Buyer delivers to Raytheon a notice accepting
the Closing Statement, or the Buyer does not deliver a written objection to
the Closing Statement within such 30-day period, then, effective as of either
the date of delivery of such notice of acceptance or as of the close of
business on such 30th day, the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be
accepted by the Buyer.   (d) If the Buyer timely objects to the Closing
Statement, such objections shall be resolved as follows:   (i) The Buyer
and Raytheon shall first use reasonable efforts to resolve such
objections.   (ii) If the Buyer and Raytheon are able to resolve
such objections within 30 days after delivery to Raytheon of such statement
of objections, the Buyer and    21   Raytheon shall, within 45 days
after delivery of such statement of objections, jointly prepare and sign a
statement setting forth the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of the
Closing and the Closing Net Tangible Book Value, which amounts shall reflect
the resolution of objections agreed to by the Buyer and Raytheon.   (iii)
If the Buyer and Raytheon do not reach a resolution of all objections set
forth on the Buyer\'s statement of objections within 30 days after delivery
of such statement of objections, the Buyer and Raytheon shall, within 30 days
after the expiration of such 30-day period, (A) jointly prepare and sign a
statement setting forth (1) those objections (if any) that the Buyer and
Raytheon have resolved and the resolution of such objections and (2)
those objections that the Buyer and Raytheon did not resolve (the
"Unresolved Objections") and (B) engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve the
Unresolved Objections.   (iv) The Buyer and Raytheon shall jointly submit
to the Neutral Accountant, within 10 days after the date of the engagement of
the Neutral Accountant (as evidenced by the date of the engagement
agreement), a copy of the Closing Statement (along with
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\'s special purpose audit report thereon), a copy
of the statement of objections delivered by the Buyer to Raytheon, and the
joint statement referred to in Section 1.4(d)(iii)(A) above. Each of the
Buyer and Raytheon shall submit to the Neutral Accountant (with a copy
delivered to the other Party on the same day), within 45 days after the date
of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum (which may include
supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Objections. Each of the Buyer and Raytheon may (but shall not be
required to) submit to the Neutral Accountant (with a copy delivered to
the other Party on the same day), within 75 days after the date of the   
22   engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum responding to the
initial memorandum submitted to the Neutral Accountant by the other Party.
Unless requested by the Neutral Accountant in writing, neither the Buyer nor
Raytheon may present any additional information or arguments to the Neutral
Accountant, either orally or in writing.   (v) The Buyer and Raytheon shall
instruct the Neutral Accountant that (A) the scope of its review and
authority shall be limited to resolving the Unresolved Objections, (B) in
resolving the Unresolved Objections, the Neutral Accountant shall accept each
of the values set forth on the Closing Statement unless the Buyer
demonstrates that such value is contrary to the requirements of the Closing
Statement set forth in Section 1.4(b) (in which case its resolution of each
Unresolved Objection shall consist of the determination of an appropriate
value for each Closing Statement item that is the subject of an Unresolved
Objection, which value shall be equal to one of, or between, the values
proposed by Raytheon in the Closing Statement and by the Buyer in
its statement of objections), and (C) issue a ruling which sets forth the
resolution of each Unresolved Objection and includes a statement setting
forth the Closing Net Tangible Book Value, reflecting the Neutral
Accountant\'s resolution of the Unresolved Objections. The "Final Closing
Statement" shall be the statement accepted (or deemed accepted) by the Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.4(c), prepared and signed pursuant to Section
1.4(d)(ii) or delivered by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this Section
1.4(d)(v), as the case may be.   (vi) The resolution by the Neutral
Accountant of the Unresolved Objections shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Buyer and the Sellers. The Buyer and the Sellers agree that the procedure
set forth in this Section 1.4(d) for resolving disputes with respect to the
Closing Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
such disputes;     23   provided that this provision shall not prohibit
any Party from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of the Neutral
Accountant.   (vii) The Buyer and Raytheon shall share equally the fees
and expenses of the Neutral Accountant for its services under this Section
1.4(d). Other than such fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant, the
Buyer and Raytheon shall each be responsible for their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any actions taken pursuant to Section 1.4(c) and
this Section 1.4(d).   (e) If the Closing Net Tangible Book Value as shown
on the Final Closing Statement is less than the Target Net Tangible Book
Value, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such deficiency and Raytheon
shall pay to the Buyer, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately
available funds, within three Business Days after the date on which the Final
Closing Statement is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, an
amount equal to such deficiency (plus interest thereon at the rate of 8.0%
per annum, compounded monthly, from the Closing Date). If the Closing Net
Tangible Book Value as shown on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the
Target Net Tangible Book Value, the Purchase Price shall be increased by such
excess amount and the Buyer shall pay to Raytheon, by wire transfer or other
delivery of immediately available funds, within three Business Days after the
date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.4, an amount equal to such excess (plus interest thereon at
the rate of 8.0% per annum, compounded monthly, from the Closing Date).  
1.5 Consents to Assignment. If (a) any Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease
may not be assigned and transferred by the applicable Seller to the Buyer (as
a result of either the    24   provisions thereof or applicable laws,
statutes, rules, regulations, judgments, rulings, decisions, writs, orders or
decrees) without the consent or approval of a third party (including, for
example, a Governmental Entity) and (b) such consent or approval has not been
obtained prior to the Closing, then, with respect to each such Assigned
Contract or Real Estate Lease, (i) notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, such Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease shall not be
assigned and transferred by such Seller or assumed by the Buyer at the
Closing, (ii) such Seller and the Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable
respects, to obtain the necessary consent or approval as soon as practicable
after the Closing, provided that neither Party shall be required to make any
payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection
therewith (except to the extent provided in Section 4.1), (iii) if and when
such consent or approval is obtained, such Seller and the Buyer shall execute
such further instruments of conveyance (in substantially the form executed at
the Closing) as may be necessary to assign and transfer such Assigned
Contract or Real Estate Lease to the Buyer and (iv) from and after the
Closing until the assignment of such Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease
pursuant to clause (iii) above, such Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate, in
all reasonable respects to (1) provide the Buyer with all of the rights and
obligations under any such Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease, (2)
cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to provide such
rights and obligations to the Buyer, including subcontracting, sublicensing
or subleasing to the Buyer or the appointment of the Buyer as the agent of
the Seller for purposes of such Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease, and
(3) enforce, at the request of the Buyer and for the account of the Buyer,
any and all rights of the applicable Seller arising under any such Assigned
Contract or    25   Real Estate Lease (provided that Section 10.3(b),
and not this clause (iv), shall apply in the case of any such Assigned
Contract that is a Government Contract (as defined in Section 2.13)) .  
1.6 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Party\'s expense,
the other Party or Parties shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as
are necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLERS    The Sellers jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Buyer that, except as set forth in the Schedule of Exceptions provided by the
Sellers to the Buyer on the date hereof (the "Schedule of Exceptions"), the
statements contained in this Article II are true and correct as of the date
hereof and will be true and correct as of the Closing to the extent required
by Section 5.1(a). The Schedule of Exceptions shall be arranged in sections
and subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Article II. The disclosures in any section or
subsection of the Schedule of Exceptions shall qualify other sections and
subsections in this Article II to the extent it is clear from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections and
subsections. The inclusion of any information in the Schedule of Exceptions
(or any update thereto) shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material to the AIS Business, has resulted
in or would result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
2.1), or is outside the ordinary course of business.    26   For
purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "to the knowledge of the Sellers"
or any phrase of similar import shall mean and be limited to the actual
knowledge of the following individuals: Richard F. Anderson, Gary Arnold,
William H. Cooke, Robert Drewes, Ed Gloviak, Anthony F. O\'Brien, Robert
O\'Rourke, Steven Post, Barry K. Pride, Cheryl Y. Whitis, Walter S. Hogle,
Jr., Harold D. Smith, Thomas S. Brown, and E. Dean Calvert, and with respect
to ASTOR, Tom Yeager, Bob Bearden and Angelo Strano.   2.1 Organization,
Qualification and Corporate Power. Each of the Sellers is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified to
conduct business under the laws of each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties or assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities, in each case as they relate exclusively to the AIS Business,
makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failures to
be qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller has
all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on the AIS Business in
which it is now engaged and to own, lease and use the Acquired Assets
currently owned, leased and used by it. For purposes of this Agreement, "AIS
Material Adverse Effect" means any material adverse effect on (a) the assets,
financial condition or results of operations of the AIS Business as a whole
(other than (i) any effect arising out of or resulting from economic factors
affecting the economy as a whole or factors generally affecting the industry
in which the AIS Business competes, (ii) any effect proximately caused by the
announcement of this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (iii) the failure of a Seller to be    27   awarded any particular
new contract or contracts), or (b) the ability of the Sellers to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   2.2 Authorization of
Transaction. Each Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
will be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement and such Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation by each Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of each Seller. This Agreement has been, and
such Ancillary Agreements will be, validly executed and delivered by
each Seller and, assuming this Agreement and each such Ancillary Agreement
constitute the valid and binding agreement of the Buyer, constitutes or will
constitute a valid and binding obligation of each Seller, enforceable against
each Seller in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and those providing for equitable defenses.   2.3
Noncontravention. Subject to compliance with the applicable requirements of
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"Hart-Scott-Rodino Act"), and applicable foreign antitrust or
trade regulation laws, neither the execution and delivery by any Seller of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which such Seller will be a
party, nor the consummation by any Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, will:   28    (a) conflict with or violate any
provision of the charter or bylaws of any Seller;   (b) except for consents
to transfer or novations required with respect to contracts with Governmental
Entities, require on the part of any Seller any filing, designation,
declaration or registration with, or any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Governmental Entity, except for any filing, designation,
declaration, registration, permit, authorization, consent or approval which
if not obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect;   (c)
conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due notice
or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the acceleration of
obligations under, result in the loss of a benefit or increase in
liabilities or fees under, create in any party the right to terminate, cancel
or modify, or require any notice, consent, approval, authorization or waiver
under, any Assigned Contract or Real Estate Lease, except for (i) any
conflict, breach, default, acceleration, loss, increase, or right to
terminate, cancel or modify that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
any notice, consent, approval, authorization or waiver the absence of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in an AIS Material Adverse Effect;   (d) violate any order, writ,
injunction, judgment, ruling, decision or decree specifically naming, or
statute, rule, law, ordinance or regulation applicable to, any Seller or any
of their respective properties or assets or the Acquired Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, except for any violation that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse
Effect; or   29    (e) result in the creation of any Encumbrance (as
defined in Section 2.8) upon any of the Acquired Assets.   2.4 Financial
Statements. Schedule 2.4 includes copies of the following financial
statements with respect to the AIS Business: (a) the audited combined balance

damages in excess of $500,000 or (iii) equitable relief that would materially
impair the operation of the AIS Business as currently conducted. There is no
(i) judgment, writ, order, decree, stipulation, ruling, decision or
injunction of a Governmental Entity specifically naming any Seller that
relates to the AIS Business or (ii) action, suit, arbitration or proceeding

AIS Employees whose annual rate of compensation exceeds $150,000, along with

There is not currently in effect any litigation between any Seller and the
Union relating to the collective bargaining relationship or the collective
bargaining agreement, including but not limited to grievances, arbitrations
or unfair labor practice proceedings, except any which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an
AIS Material Adverse Effect. The Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be
deemed an Assigned Contract.   2.17 Employee Benefits.   (a) Schedule
2.17 contains a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement,
of all Employee Benefit Plans (as defined below) maintained, or contributed
to, by any Seller for the benefit of AIS Employees (and their beneficiaries)
or under which the AIS Business would otherwise reasonably be expected to
have liability in respect of the AIS Employees (the "AIS Benefit Plans"). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Employee Benefit Plan" means (i) any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) other than a   
45   "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii)
any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
and (iii) any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement involving
compensation, including without limitation insurance coverage, severance
benefits, vacation, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses,
stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other
forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement compensation or benefits,
but excluding any Employee Benefit Plan required to be maintained or
contributed to under foreign law. Complete and accurate copies of all AIS
Benefit Plans (or, if no written plan or agreement, a complete and accurate
written summary thereof) and all related trust agreements, insurance
contracts and summary plan descriptions have been made available to the
Buyer.   (b) Each AIS Benefit Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and each Seller has met its
obligations with respect to such AIS Benefit Plan. Each AIS Benefit Plan is
in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), the regulations thereunder and any other applicable laws.   (c)
There are no termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for
benefits payable in the normal operation of the AIS Benefit Plans
and proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations orders), suits
or proceedings against or involving any AIS Benefit Plan or asserting any
rights or claims to benefits under any AIS Benefit Plan, or, to the knowledge
of the Sellers, any pending or threatened such proceedings or other claims,
suits, proceedings, or investigations by any Governmental Entity involving
any AIS Benefit Plan, which could reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the AIS Business.   46    (d) The AIS Benefit
Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have
received determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that such AIS Benefit Plans are qualified and the plans and the trusts
related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and nothing has occurred, whether by
action or failure to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss
of any such qualification, except for such failures to qualify which may be
corrected without material liability to the AIS Business.   (e) None of the
Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) has withdrawn from any
multiemployer plan in a complete or partial withdrawal which has resulted in
any material withdrawal liability which has not been satisfied in full, and
none of the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate reasonably expects to incur any
such liability. All required contributions by any Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate to any such multiemployer plan have been made in full. For
purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means any entity which is a
member of (i) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code), (ii) a group of trades or businesses under common
control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code), or (iii) an affiliated
service group (as defined under Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations
under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes any Seller.   (f)
No AIS Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits after termination of employment
to any AIS Employee (or to any beneficiary of any such employee), excluding
continuation of health coverage required to be continued under Section 4980B
of the Code or other applicable laws.   47    (g) No act or omission has
occurred and no condition exists with respect to any AIS Benefit Plan
maintained by any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate that would subject any Seller
or any ERISA Affiliate to any fine, penalty, Tax or liability of any kind
imposed under ERISA or the Code (other than liabilities for benefits accrued
under AIS Benefit Plans for AIS Employees and their beneficiaries), except
for any fine, penalty, Tax or liability that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material.   (h) No AIS Benefit
Plan is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of
the Code.   2.18 Environmental Matters.   (a) For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms have the meanings provided below.   (i)

Environmental Law (including, without limitation, strict liability under
CERCLA and analogous Environmental Law) relating to the properties and the
business which are the subject of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Off-Site Liabilities.   (vi)
"Off-Site Liabilities" means Environmental Matters resulting from any
transportation, treatment, storage, disposal or Release, or the arrangement
therefor, in connection with the AIS Business, of any Materials
of Environmental Concern to or at any property, location, site or facility
other than an AIS Property, but Off-Site Liabilities do not include
Environmental Matters to the extent arising from Releases on an AIS Property,
manifested by contamination on such property which has migrated beyond a
boundary of such property through soil or ground water.   (vii) "AIS
Properties" means the Owned Real Property and Leased Facilities or
government-owned facility now or formerly operated by the AIS Business, but

of Exceptions or in a document listed in the Schedule of Exceptions:   (i)

aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse
Effect;   (ii) there is no pending or threatened civil or
criminal litigation, written notice of violation or formal administrative
proceeding, investigation or claim relating to any Environmental Law
involving the AIS Business, any of the AIS Properties, any property formerly
owned or operated by the AIS Business, except for any such litigation,
notice, proceeding, investigation or claim that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse
Effect;   (iii) The Sellers have those permits, licenses and
approvals required under Environmental Law to operate the AIS Properties as
currently operated by the Sellers, except for any such permit, license or
approval the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect; and  
(iv) No Materials of Environmental Concern have been Released by the AIS
Business that would require remediation under applicable Environmental Law,
except for any such Release that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect.   (c)
The Parties agree that the only representations and warranties of the Sellers
herein as to any Environmental Matters are those contained in this Section
2.18. Without    50   limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Buyer specifically acknowledges that the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 2.15, 2.19 and 2.20 do not relate to Environmental
Matters.   2.19 Legal Compliance. Each Seller is in compliance with all
applicable laws (including rules, regulations, statutes, writs, orders,
judgments and decrees thereunder) of any federal, state or foreign
government, or any Governmental Entity, currently in effect with respect to
the AIS Business, except where the failure to comply therewith would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AIS
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Sellers has received written notice of
any pending action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation relating to
the AIS Business alleging any failure to so comply, except for any that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an
AIS Material Adverse Effect.   2.20 Permits. Schedule 2.20 lists all Legal
Permits held by any Seller relating to the AIS Business or the use and
ownership of the Acquired Assets, the absence of which would, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Sellers, (a) each Legal Permit listed in
Schedule 2.20 is in full force and effect and none of the Sellers is in
violation of or default thereunder, and (b) no suspension or cancellation of
any such Legal Permit is threatened, except for any violation, default,
suspension or cancellation that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the AIS
Business or materially impair the operation of the AIS Business.   51   
2.21 Title to Assets. Each of the Sellers owns or has the right to
transfer all of the Acquired Assets. All of the tangible Acquired Assets have
been adequately maintained for their continued operation, subject to normal
wear and tear, except where the failure to maintain such Acquired Assets
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an AIS Material Adverse Effect.   2.22 Government-Furnished Equipment.
Schedule 2.22 incorporates by reference to their location the most recent
schedules delivered to any Governmental Entity, as of the date of this
Agreement, which identifies by description or by inventory number certain
equipment and fixtures loaned, bailed or otherwise furnished to or held by
any Seller by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity and used exclusively or
primarily in the AIS Business. Such schedules are maintained in the files of
the respective projects and were accurate and complete and, as of the Closing
Date, would contain only those additions and omit only those deletions of
equipment and fixtures that have occurred in the ordinary course of business,
except for such inaccuracies that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   2.23
Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of the AIS Business,
as reflected in Most Recent Balance Sheet, arose from sales actually made
or services actually performed in the ordinary course of business.   2.24
Brokers Fees. Except for Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc., whose fees and expenses
will be paid by the Sellers, no finder, broker, agent or other intermediary
has worked for or on behalf of any of the Sellers in connection with the
negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.  
52    2.25 Affiliate Relationships. No agreement, arrangement or
relationship exists between the AIS Business on the one hand and any of the
Sellers or their Affiliates on the other hand, except for agreements,
arrangements and relationships (i) with respect to accounts receivable and
accounts payable relating to the AIS Business that do not constitute Acquired
Assets or Assumed Liabilities, and (ii) contemplated by the Ancillary
Agreements or Section 10.5 of this Agreement.   2.26 Liability for Cost and
Pricing Data. To the knowledge of the Sellers, there exists no reasonable
basis for a claim for any liability of the AIS Business by any Governmental
Entity as a result of defective cost and pricing data submitted to any
Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, any such data relating to
liabilities accrued on the books of the AIS Business or in the financial
accounts for deferred compensation to any AIS Employee, except any such
liability that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in an AIS Material Adverse Effect.   ARTICLE III

the case of either clause (a) or (b), would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.   3.5 Financing. The Buyer has, and at the Closing will have,
sufficient sources of financing in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and to fulfill its obligations hereunder,
including without limitation payment to the Sellers of the Purchase Price at
the Closing.   3.6 Due Diligence by the Buyer. The Buyer acknowledges that

not limit the scope of the representations and warranties contained herein
and in the Ancillary Agreements, including Sections 2.4, 2.6 and 2.26 hereof

COVENANTS   4.1 Closing Efforts; Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.   (a) Each of the
Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to take all actions and to do
all things reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable commercial efforts
to (i) obtain all waivers, permits, consents, approvals or other
authorizations from Governmental Entities and other third parties (the "Third
Party Consents"), (ii) effect all registrations, declarations, filings and
notices with or to Governmental Entities (the "Governmental Filings"), (iii)
otherwise comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, statutes,
orders, decrees, judgments, rules and regulations in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)
take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary or as another Party
may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article V
hereof or otherwise to comply with this Agreement. Each of the Parties shall
promptly notify each of the other Parties of any fact, condition, or
event known to it that could reasonably be expected to prohibit, make
unlawful or delay the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby.
Each of the    57   Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses
associated with obtaining Third Party Consents from Governmental Entities and
effecting Governmental Filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parties shall be required to pay any out-of-pocket costs associated with
obtaining Third Party Consents from entities other than Governmental
Entities; provided that if an out-of-pocket payment is required to obtain a
Third Party Consent which is listed on Schedule 5.1(f) or which Raytheon and
the Buyer agree is advisable to obtain, Raytheon and the Buyer shall each pay
50% of such out-of-pocket payment.   (b) Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of the Parties shall (or shall cause the appropriate

related material that it may be required to file with the Federal Trade

Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (ii) use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (iii) make any further filings or information

challenges to the transactions contemplated hereby by any
Governmental Entity. Each of the Parties shall promptly inform each other of
any material communication (and shall send a copy of any such written or
electronic communication to the other Parties) received by such Party from
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other    58   Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (unless the provision of such information
would (i) violate the provisions of any applicable laws or regulations
(including without limitation those relating to security clearance or export
controls) or any confidentiality agreement or (ii) cause the loss of the
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto); provided that each such
Party shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to promptly communicate to
the other Parties the substance of any such material communication, whether
by redacting parts of such material communication or otherwise, so that such
communication would not violate applicable laws or regulations or cause the
loss of the attorney-client privilege with respect thereto.   4.2
Replacement of Guarantees and Letters of Credit. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Seller Guarantees" means all guarantees, covenants,
indemnities, letters of credit and similar credit assurances provided by any
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates that relate exclusively or
primarily to the AIS Business. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Sellers, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange,
prior to the Closing, for replacement arrangements (which shall include a
full and complete release of each Seller and their respective Affiliates),
from all Seller Guarantees. To fulfill such obligation, the Buyer shall not
be obligated to pay any consent fee or similar amount, but shall be obligated
to offer to provide substitute security or guarantees that it reasonably
believes to be of like character, quality and amount. The Buyer will consult
with the Sellers from time to time concerning the progress made with respect
to such efforts, and shall permit the Sellers reasonable participation in
such process. All Seller Guarantees as of the date of this Agreement are
listed on Schedule 4.2. This Section 4.2 (and Section 5.2(e)) shall not apply
to any Seller Guarantee issued between    59   the date of this
Agreement and the Closing unless (a) notice of such Seller Guarantee is
provided to the Buyer at least 15 days prior to the Closing and such Seller
Guarantee is for an amount of not more than $500,000, provided, however, that
the aggregate amount of all Seller Guarantees issued pursuant to this clause
(a) does not exceed $5,000,000, or (b) such Seller Guarantee is issued with
the consent of the Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).   4.3 Operation of Business. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, or as set forth on Schedule 4.3, during the period from the date
of this Agreement until the Closing, each of the Sellers shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to (i) operate the AIS Business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and (ii) preserve the present business
organization of the AIS Business intact. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, prior to the Closing, none of the Sellers shall, without the
written consent of the Buyer:   (a) sell, assign or transfer any portion of
the Acquired Assets in a single transaction or series of related transactions
in an amount in excess of $1,000,000, except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice;   (b) incur or guarantee any
Indebtedness relating exclusively or primarily to the AIS Business;   (c)

past practice of the AIS Business;   60    (d) make any capital

stock purchase or asset purchase (except for any such business which will not

existing agreement) with any AIS Employee whose annual base salary exceeds
$150,000, except in the ordinary course of business;   (g) establish,

law;   (h) materially change its accounting principles, methods or

Designated Intellectual Property or the maintenance of the books, accounts,
files and records of the AIS Business, except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice;   (k) amend, modify, terminate,
cancel, or allow to lapse any insurance policies related exclusively or
primarily to the Acquired Assets or the AIS Business;   61    (l) take
any action that would not be in compliance in all material respects with all

other obligations related to the AIS Business, the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities;   (m) except for any agreement, bid, proposal or other
commitment relating to Operation Enduring Freedom, (i) enter into any

send to the applicable Seller (in writing or via e-mail) an objection within
two business days following receipt, in writing or via e-mail, by such Seller
to the Buyer of written notice (including a reasonable description thereof)
of such agreement, bid, proposal or other commitment) or which is expected to
result in a loss in excess of $100,000 for any individual agreement or
$500,000 in the aggregate; or (iii) amend, supplement, waive, modify,

under an existing Government Contract; or (ii) enter into any new Government
Contract with respect to an existing Government Bid which is expected to

Seller shall permit the representatives, agents, employees, counsel, advisors
and potential financing sources of the Buyer to have access (at reasonable

interfere with the normal business operations of the AIS Business) to
the premises, properties, financial, accounting, tax and operating
records, contracts, and other records and documents, of or pertaining to the
AIS Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Sellers shall be
obligated (i) to provide any information, documents or access to any person
unless the Buyer is responsible, pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality
letter agreement dated September 28, 2001 between the Buyer    64   and
Raytheon (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), for the use and disclosure of any
information obtained by such person from Raytheon, or such person enters into
a confidentiality agreement with Raytheon on terms that are substantially the
same as those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) to
provide any information, documents or access that would (A) violate the
provisions of any applicable laws or regulations (including without
limitation those relating to security clearance or export controls) or any
confidentiality agreement to which it is a party or (B) cause the loss of the
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto; provided that each Seller
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide information, documents and
access to the Buyer and its representatives, agents, employees, counsel,
advisors and potential financing sources in a manner that would not violate
applicable laws or regulations or cause the loss of the attorney-client
privilege with respect thereto. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer and its
representatives shall not contact or communicate with the employees,
customers and suppliers of any Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
applicable Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (b) The
Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality
Agreement remains in full force and effect and that information provided by
any Party to the other Party or Parties pursuant to this Agreement prior to
the Closing shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms. If the Closing occurs, the Confidentiality
Agreement, insofar as it covers information relating exclusively or primarily
to the AIS Business, shall terminate effective as of the Closing, but shall
remain in effect insofar as it covers other information disclosed
thereunder.   65    (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the Buyer and its representatives shall not have any access
at any time prior to the Closing to any information regarding pending or
proposed bids for new contracts or subcontracts or any related information
where the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer also has submitted or intends to
submit a bid for such contract or subcontract.   4.5 Purchase of Equipment.
One of the Sellers shall, prior to the Closing, purchase any equipment or
other tangible assets that (i) relate exclusively or primarily to the AIS
Business and (ii) are leased by any Seller or an Affiliate thereof pursuant
to a lease that is not an Assigned Contract. Such purchased equipment and
tangible assets shall be deemed Acquired Assets and shall be sold, conveyed,
assigned and transferred to the Buyer at the Closing.   4.6 Exclusivity.
Each Seller shall not, and shall use its best efforts to cause its officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents not to, (i) initiate,
solicit or encourage any proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other
than the Buyer) concerning any merger, business combination, sale of stock or
sale of assets (other than sales of assets in the ordinary course
of business) involving the AIS Business (other than as part of a sale of
Raytheon substantially in its entirety) or (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any party (other than the Buyer) concerning any such
transaction.   4.7 Schedules. The Sellers shall be entitled to submit to the
Buyer, from time to time between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
written updates to the Schedule of Exceptions to disclose any events or
developments that occur between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date. The Sellers\' representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be construed for all purposes of Section 5.1 and Article VII
of this Agreement in accordance with    66   the Schedule of
Exceptions, as so updated; provided that the Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as a result of any such update to the Schedule of
Exceptions to the extent provided in Section 6.1(c); and provided, further,
that no updates to the Schedule of Exceptions shall be taken into account for
purposes of Article VII unless, as a result of any particular update or
updates, the Buyer had but did not exercise a right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(c).   4.8 Title Insurance. The Buyer
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, commitments for the Title Policies (the
"Title Commitments") and the ALTA surveys referred to in Section 5.1(h). The
Buyer shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses of obtaining
such Title Commitments and ALTA surveys. The applicable Seller shall provide
to the Buyer, promptly following a request by the Buyer, an affidavit of
title with respect to each piece of Owned Real Property in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Title Company and such other affidavits with respect to
each piece of Owned Real Property as may be reasonably requested by the Title
Company. Unless the Buyer notifies Raytheon in writing within 30 days after
the date of this Agreement that a Title Policy contains any exceptions
(beyond those set forth in Section 2.9(a)) which are not acceptable to the
Buyer, the condition to Closing set forth in Section 5.1(h) shall be deemed
waived by the Buyer; provided, however, that if after the expiration of such
30-day period but prior to Closing, a new title exception (other than those
set forth in Section 2.9(a)) appears of record which is not reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer, the Buyer shall be entitled to object to such new
title exception as not in conformity with the condition to Closing set forth
in Section 5.1(h).   67    4.9 Cooperation in Financing.   (a) From the
date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall request their auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to
reasonably cooperate, on a timely basis with the Buyer and the Buyer\'s
auditors in their preparation of any audited financial statements of the AIS
Business that are required for SEC filings required to be made by the Buyer
in connection with the purchase of the AIS Business. The Buyer anticipates
requiring audited financial statements of the AIS Business for the most
recent three years, including statements of operations, cash flows
and investment equity for three years and two balance sheets. The
cooperation required of the Sellers shall include providing reasonable and
customary management and legal representations to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
and the cooperation requested of the Sellers\' auditors shall include
providing consent to the Buyer to include their audit reports on the AIS
Business in the Buyer\'s SEC filings.   (b) Without limitation of the
foregoing paragraph (a), each of the Sellers agrees to provide, and will
request their respective accountants, investment bankers, advisors, counsel
and other representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of financing by the Buyer to be consummated prior to or
at the Closing in respect of transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the replacement of the Seller Guarantees. Such cooperation shall include, to
the extent reasonable and customary, participation in meetings and due
diligence sessions and assistance with the preparation of offering memoranda,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that such cooperation
is not intended to condition the Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the obtaining of any
financing,    68   and the Buyer may not assert a breach by the Sellers
of this Section 4.9 as a basis for its failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   4.10 Tax Certificates.   (a) Raytheon
shall provide the Buyer with a certificate that complies with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b) that states that it is not a foreign person.
Raytheon Australia shall provide the Buyer with a statement that complies
with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) that certifies that the
assets acquired from Raytheon Australia are not U.S. real property interests.
If either Raytheon or Raytheon Australia fails to deliver such certificate or
statement, as applicable, by the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be entitled to
withhold from any amounts payable to such Seller at the Closing
all applicable withholding taxes under Section 1445 of the Code.   (b) The
Sellers shall provide to the Buyer, no later than the Closing, a certificate
on Raytheon letterhead providing all information reasonably required by the
Buyer relating to the base period research and experimental expenses and any
other information reasonably requested by the Buyer to allow the Buyer to
claim research and experimentation tax credits in accordance with the Code
and regulations promulgated thereunder.   ARTICLE V   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

which the Owned Real Property is located, as may reasonably be   
71   required by the Buyer or its lender, and (ii) an ALTA survey with

other customary certificates (such as certificates of good standing of the

transactions to be consummated at the Closing is subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver in writing by the Sellers) of the following conditions:   (a) the
representations and warranties of the Buyer set forth in Article III shall be

except (i) for those representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a particular date (which shall be true and correct as of such date,
subject to clause (ii) below), and (ii) where the failure of
the representations and warranties to be true and correct would not

with Raytheon Systems Limited attached hereto as Exhibit M;   73    (g)
all applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Act and applicable foreign antitrust or trade regulation laws

in a material adverse effect on the Sellers, taken as a whole;   (h) the

6.1 Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate this Agreement prior
to the Closing as provided below:   (a) the Parties may terminate this
Agreement by mutual written consent;   74    (b) the Buyer may terminate
this Agreement by giving written notice to Raytheon in the event any Seller
is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination with any
other such breach, (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 5.1(a)
or Section 5.1(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured within 30 days
following delivery by the Buyer to Raytheon of written notice of such
breach;   (c) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to Raytheon, within 10 days following the end of the 30-day period
referred to below in this Section 6.1(c), in the event any Seller provides an
update to the Schedule of Exceptions pursuant to Section 4.7 which contains
information that, absent such disclosure and the provisions of Section 4.7
permitting the update of representations and warranties, would have the
effect of causing the condition set forth in Section 5.1(a) not to be
satisfied, and the Sellers fail to cure the event or condition causing the
failure of such condition within 30 days following delivery by the Buyer to
Raytheon of written notice under this Section 6.1(c);   (d) Raytheon may
terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer in the event
the Buyer is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, and such breach, individually or in combination
with any other such breach, (i) would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured
within 30 days following delivery by Raytheon to the Buyer of written notice
of such breach;   (e) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to Raytheon if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the date six months after the date of    75   this Agreement by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.1 (unless
the failure results primarily from a breach by the Buyer of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement); and   (f) Raytheon may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the date six months after the date of this Agreement by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.2 (unless the failure
results primarily from a breach by any Seller of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement).   6.2 Effect
of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.1, all obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any
liability of any Party to the other Parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from
liability for any breach by such Party, prior to the termination of this
Agreement, of any covenant or agreement (but not any representation or
warranty) contained in this Agreement or impair the right of any Party to
obtain such remedies as may be available to it in law or equity with respect
to such a breach by any other Party.   ARTICLE VII   INDEMNIFICATION  
7.1 Indemnification by Raytheon. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VII, from and after the Closing, Raytheon shall indemnify the
Buyer in respect of, and hold the Buyer harmless against, any and all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, fines, fees, penalties, costs and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees,
disbursements and expenses) (collectively, "Damages") incurred by the Buyer
or any of its    76   directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, representatives or advisors resulting from, arising out of or
constituting:   (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Sellers contained in this Agreement or the Raytheon Certificate (other than
Section 2.18);   (b) any failure by any Seller to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;   (c)
any Excluded Liabilities; or   (d) any Environmental Matters, but only to
the extent the liability or obligation relating thereto arises from
conditions existing or events occurring prior to the Closing, and provided
that Raytheon\'s indemnity obligation under this Section 7.1(d) shall be
limited to 50% of the Damages covered by this Section 7.1(d).   7.2
Indemnification by the Buyer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VII, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify
each Seller in respect of, and hold each Seller harmless against, any and all
Damages incurred by any Seller or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, representatives or advisors
resulting from, arising out of, or constituting:   (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in this Agreement or the
Buyer Certificate;   (b) any failure by the Buyer to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; or   (c)
any Assumed Liabilities, except to the extent Raytheon is liable therefor
under Section 7.1(d).   77    7.3 Defense or Control of Third Party
Actions and Environmental Claims.   (a) A person entitled to indemnification
under this Article VII (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written
notification to the person from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
commenced by a person or entity (other than a Party or an Affiliate of a
Party) for which indemnification may be sought under this Article VII (a
"Third Party Action"); provided that any claim, demand, action, suit or
proceeding covered by Section 7.3(b) shall not be considered a Third Party
Action and shall not be governed by this Section 7.3(a), other than
as expressly provided in Section 7.3(b). Such notification shall be given
within 10 days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice of such Third
Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by
the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party
Action and the amount of the claimed damages; provided, however, that no
delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or
obligation hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is damaged
or prejudiced by such failure. Within 20 days after delivery of such
notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action
with counsel of its choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.
An Indemnifying Party\'s decision to assume control of such defense shall not
be an admission that the Third Party Action is indemnifiable under this
Article VII. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under
the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party
Action, or thereafter abandons or fails to diligently pursue the defense of a
Third Party Action, the Indemnified Party shall control    78   such
defense. The party not controlling the defense of such Third Party
Action (the "Non-controlling Party") may participate in such defense at its
own expense, except as provided below. The party controlling the defense of
such Third Party Action (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-
controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any
written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the
Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of a Third Party Action,
any fees and expenses of separate counsel to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for which the
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII
only if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on written advice
from counsel, that (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Action or (ii)
there are defenses available to such Indemnifying Party and the
representation of both parties by the same counsel would therefore be
inappropriate, and the Indemnified Party so notifies the Indemnifying Party
in writing before incurring such fees and expenses (provided that in such
situation, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to employ more than
one law firm, plus one firm acting solely as local counsel). The Indemnifying
Party shall not agree to any settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Action without the prior written
consent of    79   the Indemnified Party; provided that the consent of
the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees
in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement, compromise
or judgment and such settlement, compromise or judgment includes a complete
written release of the Indemnified Party from further liability and does not
impose any injunctive relief or other operational restrictions on the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (b) The Buyer shall give
prompt written notice to Raytheon of (i) the commencement of any claim,
demand, action, suit or proceeding by a person or entity (other than a Party)
involving Environmental Matters for which indemnification may be sought under
Section 7.1 and (ii) the assertion of any claim, commencement of any inquiry
or receipt of any notice involving Environmental Matters for which
indemnification may be sought under Section 7.1 (collectively, an
"Environmental Claim"). Such notification shall be given within 10 days after
receipt by the Buyer of notice of such Environmental Claim, and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Buyer) the facts
constituting the basis for such Environmental Claim and the amount of
the claimed Damages; provided, however, that no delay or failure on the part
of the Buyer in so notifying Raytheon shall relieve Raytheon of any liability
or obligation hereunder except to the extent Raytheon is damaged or
prejudiced by such failure. Except for Off-Site Liabilities, the defense of
which shall be controlled by Raytheon, Buyer, shall control the defense of
such Environmental Claim (with counsel of its choosing reasonably acceptable
to Raytheon), and manage, direct and perform any related environmental
assessment    80   or remediation on any affected AIS Property
("Environmental Response Activities"). If the Buyer has conducted any
Environmental Response Activities on the affected AIS Property prior to
notifying Raytheon, Raytheon shall have no responsibility or liability for
the costs of such activities conducted more than 10 days prior to such
notice. The Buyer hereby grants Raytheon and its employees, agents, servants,
consultants and contractors a license, subject to security requirements,
including entry by only U.S. citizens, to enter upon the affected AIS
Property for purposes related to overseeing its obligations under this
Agreement, subject to the following conditions:   (i) Raytheon shall have
reasonable access at reasonable times pre-arranged at least 48 hours in
advance where practical, unless Raytheon received less than five business
days advance notice of an activity it reasonably wishes to oversee;   (ii)
Raytheon shall hold harmless and indemnify the Buyer from any claims,
demands, actions, suits or proceedings for injuries to persons or damages to
property caused by Raytheon or its agents, servants, consultants
and contractors while on the affected AIS Property overseeing Environmental
Response Activities pursuant to the license granted by this Section
7.3(b);   (iii) Raytheon assumes no responsibility for notification, removal
or remediation of contaminants which may be in, on, under or at the affected
AIS Property as a result of the actions or operations of (A) the Buyer or
its employees, agents, servants, consultants and contractors or (B) third
parties or their respective employees, agents, servants, consultants and
contractors after the Closing;   81    (iv) the Buyer shall hold
harmless and indemnify the Sellers (and their agents) from any claims,
demands or actions for injuries to persons or damages to property caused by
the Buyer or its agents, servants, consultants and contractors while on the
affected AIS Property managing, directing or performing Environmental
Response Activities; provided that the required procedures and conditions for
indemnification set forth in this Article VII shall apply with respect to any
indemnification by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)(iv);   (v) the
Buyer shall cause this license to survive any transfer of ownership or
operational control of an AIS Property to a third party, and to be binding
upon such third party;   (vi) if the Buyer, or any successor owner, occupant
or operator of any property subject to said license, defaults under this
Section 7.3(b) or terminates the license granted hereunder for any reason,
Raytheon\'s obligations to conduct the Environmental Response Activities (or
to indemnify the Buyer for Damages relating thereto) shall cease;   (vii)
Buyer shall use consultants and counsel reasonably acceptable to Raytheon;
and   (viii) Buyer shall provide Raytheon with copies of all reports
and correspondence relating to the indemnified matter, and, if practicable,
provide Raytheon with an opportunity to comment upon all submissions to a
regulatory agency at least five business days prior to submission. Buyer
shall incorporate reasonable, timely comments, unless in Buyer\'s opinion,
such comments: (1) are more likely to increase the cost of Buyer\'s
obligations; or (2) are not consistent with Buyer\'s obligations hereunder,
provided, however, that Buyer\'s decision not to include comments proposed by
Raytheon shall not alter the limitations on Raytheon\'s   
82   indemnity obligation set out in this Section VII. If Raytheon agrees
in writing and without qualification to pay all increased costs identified by
Buyer under subpart (1) of the preceding sentence, Buyer will incorporate
Raytheon\'s reasonable comments.   7.4 Claims for Indemnification.   (a)
In order to seek indemnification under this Article VII, an Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notification (a "Claim
Notice") which contains (i) a description of the Damages incurred by the
Indemnified Party and the amount (the "Claimed Amount") of such Damages, (ii)
a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this Article VII for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the
basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such
Damages.   (b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
(the "Response") in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which
case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire
transfer), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive some,
but not all (the "Agreed Amount") of the Claimed Amount (in which case the
Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer) or
(iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.   (c) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a
Response that disputes the Indemnified Party\'s right to receive some or all
of the Claimed Amount (a    83   "Dispute"), the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If
the Dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, then the Dispute shall
be resolved by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts (if initiated by
the Buyer) or New York, New York (if initiated by a Seller) conducted by a
single independent arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the
"AAA") in effect from time to time (the "AAA Rules"). Either the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party may submit such Dispute to arbitration by
submitting to the AAA a Demand for Arbitration in accordance with the AAA
Rules. If such Dispute is not submitted to arbitration as provided in this
Section 7.4(c) within 60 days following the expiration of the 30-day period
referred to in this Section 7.4(c), then the indemnification claim which is
the subject of such Dispute (but only to the extent it is subject to such
Dispute) shall be deemed waived by the Indemnified Party for all purposes and
the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying
Party the portion of the Claimed Amount which is subject to such Dispute.
Arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.4 shall be the
exclusive means of resolving such Dispute, and neither the Indemnifying Party
nor the Indemnified Party may commence litigation for damages with respect to
such Dispute.   (d) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under
the AAA Rules or otherwise, to (i) modify or disregard any provision of this
Agreement, including those set forth in Section 7.6, (ii) address or resolve
any issue other than the Dispute submitted to such arbitration in accordance
with this Section 7.4, (iii) make an award of Damages in excess of the
portion of the Claimed Amount that is subject to such Dispute or (iv) grant
injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall    84   request that
the Arbitrator prepare and distribute to such Parties, as promptly as is
practicable, a written decision setting forth the Arbitrator\'s decision with
respect to such Dispute and the Arbitrator\'s reasons therefor
(the "Arbitration Award"). The Arbitration Award shall be final, conclusive
and binding upon the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and
judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction (as provided in Section 11.11).   (e) The Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party shall each bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with the arbitration, and shall share equally the fees and
expenses of the Arbitrator and AAA.   7.5 Survival. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Raytheon Certificate and the
Buyer Certificate shall survive the Closing and shall expire on the date 15
months following the Closing Date, except that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.11 (and the portion of the Raytheon
Certificate relating thereto) shall survive until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.7
(and the portion of the Raytheon Certificate relating thereto) shall survive
until 60 days following expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.18 (and the portion
of the Raytheon Certificate relating thereto) shall expire at the Closing,
and the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1
and 3.2 (and the portion of the Raytheon Certificate or the Buyer Certificate
relating thereto) shall survive the Closing without limitation. All covenants
and other agreements contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. No claim for
indemnification under Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.2(a) may be made under   
85   this Agreement after the expiration of the survival period for
such representation or warranty. Any investigations by or on behalf of a
Party shall not constitute a waiver of such Party\'s right to enforce a
representation or warranty of any other Party contained herein or in the
Ancillary Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnification
claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section 7.4 prior to the
expiration as provided in this Section 7.5 of the representation or warranty
that is the basis for such claim, then such representation or warranty shall
survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim.  
7.6 Limitations.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the following limitations shall apply to indemnification
claims under this Article VII:   (i) Raytheon shall be liable with respect
to claims under Section 7.1(a) for only that portion of the aggregate Damages
related to such claims which exceeds 2% of the Adjusted Purchase Price;
and   (ii) the Buyer shall be liable with respect to claims under Section
7.2(a) for only that portion of the aggregate Damages related to such claims
which exceeds 2% of the Adjusted Purchase Price;   (iii) the aggregate
liability of Raytheon for all Damages under Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.1(d)
shall not exceed an amount equal to 15% of the Adjusted Purchase Price;
and   (iv) the aggregate liability of the Buyer for all Damages
under Section 7.2(a) shall not exceed an amount equal to 15% of the Adjusted
Purchase Price.   86    (b) No Party shall be entitled to make any claim
for indemnification with respect to any matter to the extent the Purchase
Price has been adjusted to reflect such matter pursuant to Section 1.4. The
amount of Damages for which the Buyer is entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.1(a) shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or
provisions therefor reflected in the Final Closing Statement.   (c) In no
event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any Damages
or other amounts under this Article VII that are incidental, consequential,
in the nature of lost profits, special, multiple or punitive or any equitable
equivalent thereof or substitute therefor (collectively, "Special Damages")
based upon, or arising out of, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements or
any course of conduct, course of dealing, statements or actions of any Party
relating thereto; provided, however, that Special Damages shall
be indemnifiable under this Article VII to the extent owed by a Party to a
third party.   (d) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified
Party under this Article VII with respect to an indemnity claim shall be
reduced by the amount of any payment received by such Indemnified Party (or
an Affiliate thereof), with respect to the Damages to which such indemnity
claim relates, from an insurance carrier, net of any retroactive premium
increase payable by such Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) as a
result of such insurance payment; provided, however, that no Indemnified
Party shall be required to provide notice of or pursue recovery in respect of
any claim under the Indemnified Party\'s insurance policies where the
Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable discretion that such notice or
pursuit is likely to invalidate any portion of the coverage available under
such policy or result in the imposition of retroactive premiums or material
prospective premium increases; and, provided, further, that if   
87   an Indemnified Party makes such a determination after it has notified
its insurer, it shall be entitled to retract such notice. An Indemnified
Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue, and to cause its
Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims to which it may be entitled in
connection with any Damages it incurs, and the Parties shall cooperate with
each other in pursuing insurance claims with respect to any Damages or any
indemnification obligations with respect to Damages. If an Indemnified Party
(or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in connection with any claim
for Damages for which it has already received an indemnification payment from
the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within 60
days of receiving such insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess of
(A) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party under this
Article VII with respect to such claim plus the amount of the insurance
payments received (net of the offsets described in the first sentence of this
Section 7.6(d)), over (B) the amount of Damages with respect to such claim
which the Indemnified Party has become entitled to receive under this Article
VII.   (e) Each Party agrees that (i) it shall not offset any payment it
is entitled to receive (or it claims it is entitled to receive) from
an Indemnifying Party under this Article VII against any other payment or
other obligation it owes to such Indemnifying Party (or any Affiliate
thereof) under this Agreement or otherwise (other than payments or
obligations owed pursuant to this Article VII) and (ii) it shall not offset
any payment it is obligated to make to an Indemnified Party under this
Article VII against any other payment or other obligation it is entitled to
receive (or it claims it is entitled to receive) from such Indemnified Party
(or any Affiliate thereof) under this Agreement or otherwise (other than
payments or obligations owed pursuant to this Article VII).   88    (f)
If the Buyer incurs any Damages resulting from, arising out of,
or constituting Environmental Matters and arising from conditions existing
or events occurring prior to the Closing, Raytheon shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to pursue any indemnity claim it may have under the
Chrysler Agreement with respect to such Damages. Any payment Raytheon
receives pursuant to such indemnity claim, net of any costs incurred by
Raytheon in pursuing such indemnity claim, shall be promptly remitted to the
Buyer, and the amount of such payment to the Buyer shall reduce the amount of
Damages to which Raytheon\'s obligation under Section 7.1(d) (covering 50% of
such Damages) shall apply.   (g) Except with respect to claims for equitable
relief, including specific performance, made with respect to breaches of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, the rights of the Parties under this Article VII, from and after
the Closing, shall (in the absence of fraud) be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to
claims covered by Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 or otherwise relating to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any Party, its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions
consummated by this Agreement.   (h) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:   (i) In the event Raytheon becomes obligated
pursuant to Section 7.1 to indemnify the Buyer for any Damages involving
Environmental Matters, Raytheon\'s obligations hereunder shall be satisfied
by and limited to indemnifying Buyer for 50% of those costs of investigation
or remediation of Materials of Environmental Concern at such AIS Property to
(unless otherwise required under Environmental Law) the less expensive of
either the    89   (A) levels of contamination consistent with
applicable industrial or commercial risk-based cleanup standards based upon
future commercial or industrial use of such property or (B) the highest
residual levels of contamination acceptable to the jurisdictional government
environmental agency (including the right to perform a risk-based remediation
to commercial or industrial standards). Raytheon shall not be required to do,
or to indemnify Buyer for doing, more.   (ii) Raytheon shall have no
liability under Section 7.1 for any Damages in connection with an
Environmental Matter in any way arising out of or related to any actual or
proposed (A) movement, excavation or grading of land, or construction,
reconstruction, refurbishment, renovation, modification, restoration,
conversion, structural alteration or relocation of any structure, except to
the extent reasonably necessary to repair or replace any building
or structure or utilities, facilities and appurtenances related
thereto; enlargement of any building or structure; change in use of any
building or land or any change in zoning or government land use approval, or
(B) change of any use of land at an AIS Property to the extent the change
increases the cost of any Environmental Response Activities.   (iii) The
Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1 for Damages
in connection with an Environmental Matter directly arising as a result of
the Buyer\'s voluntary disclosure to a third party (other than an Affiliate
of the Buyer) of information or data, except to the extent that it would be
unlawful not to provide such information to such third party. Nothing in this
paragraph shall preclude the Buyer from being indemnified for 50% of the
costs incurred in addressing circumstances it reasonably
determines constitute a condition    90   of ongoing noncompliance in
connection with the AIS Business, to the extent indemnification for such
costs otherwise is available under this Article VII.   (iv) The Buyer shall
only be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1(d) for such Damages
that result directly (A) from a determination (whether by judgment, order or
other legal directive) in a judicial or administrative Third Party Action
that the AIS Business has an obligation to investigate, remediate or pay
Damages on account of an Environmental Matter incurred in connection with the
AIS Business prior to the Closing Date or (B) from the settlement (with the
consent of the Seller) of such a Third Party Action. Nothing in this
paragraph shall preclude the Buyer from being indemnified for 50% of the
costs incurred in addressing circumstances it reasonably determines
constitute a condition of ongoing noncompliance in connection with the AIS
Business, to the extent indemnification for such costs otherwise is available
under this Article VII.   (v) Without limiting the generality of Section
7.6(g), this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of (i) the
Buyer and its Affiliates against the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates, and their respective present or former officers, directors and
employees, agents, attorneys or contractors, and (ii) the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and their
respective present or former officers, directors and employees, agents,
attorneys or contractors, for any and all claims, Damages or other matters
related directly or indirectly to the AIS Business and arising at any time
under Environmental Laws or under any common law with respect to Materials of
Environmental Concern. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, hereby waive (on behalf of themselves and their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns) any right to seek contribution   
91   or other recovery from each other or their respective Affiliates or
any present or former officer, director or employee, agent, attorney or
contractor of the Buyer, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
with respect to events related directly or indirectly to the AIS Business
that any of them may now or in the future have under any Environmental Law or
any common law providing for any remedy or right of recovery with respect to
Environmental Matters or Materials of Environmental Concern other than as
expressly provided for in this Article VII. In the absence of fraud, the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, hereby release
(on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns) each other, such Party\'s Affiliates, and their respective present
or former officers, directors and employees, agents, attorneys and
contractors from any and all such claims, demands and causes of action.  
7.7 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price.   ARTICLE VIII   TAX MATTERS   8.1
Responsibility for Taxes and Filing of Tax Returns.   (a) Except as provided
in Section 8.1(d) below, the Sellers shall remain responsible, and indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer, for all Taxes payable in connection with the
operation of the AIS Business for all periods through the Closing, and shall
be responsible for the filing of all related Tax Returns.   92    (b)
The Buyer shall be responsible, and indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers,
for all Taxes payable in connection with the operation of the AIS Business
from and after the Closing, and shall be responsible for the filing of all
related Tax Returns.   (c) Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a) to the contrary,
any Tax Return that pertains to both Taxes for which the Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and Taxes for which the Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(b) shall be prepared by the Buyer on a
basis consistent with the applicable Seller\'s last previous similar Tax
Return, and the Buyer shall consult with the Sellers concerning each such Tax
Return and report all items relating to the Taxes for which the Sellers are
responsible in accordance with the instructions of the Sellers; provided,
however, that if the Buyer is advised by counsel that the filing of any Tax
Return and the reporting on such Tax Return of any item in accordance with
the instructions of the Sellers reasonably could subject the Buyer to
penalties or fines, the Buyer may file such Tax Return without regard to the
Sellers\' instructions relating to such item. The Buyer shall provide
the Sellers with a copy of each proposed Tax Return the preparation of which
is governed by this Section 8.1(c) (and such additional information regarding
such Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by the Sellers) at least 20
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The cost of preparing Tax
Returns, the preparation of which is governed by this Section 8.1(c), shall
be borne equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other.   (d) The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other,
shall each be responsible for the payment of 50% of any transfer, sales, use,
stamp, conveyance, value added, recording, registration, documentary, filing
and other non-income Taxes (including any stamp    93   duty or goods
and services tax payable in Australia) arising in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   8.2
Allocation of Taxes.   (a) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes shall be
allocated between the period ending at the Closing and the period that begins
immediately following the Closing based upon the actual operations and
transactions of the AIS Business during such periods.   (b) Notwithstanding
Section 8.2(a) to the contrary, in the case of any ad valorem Taxes, real
estate Taxes, property Taxes, and other similar Taxes imposed with respect to
the ownership or use of property and assessed with respect to a taxable
period that commences before the Closing and that ends after the Closing,
such Taxes shall be allocated between the portion of such period that ends on
the Closing and the portion of such period that begins immediately following
the Closing based upon the respective number of days during such portions of
the taxable period (with the day of the Closing deemed to be in the period
following the Closing); provided, however, that appropriate adjustment shall
be made for acquisitions and dispositions of property during such period.  
8.3 Refunds and Credits.   (a) The Sellers and/or their Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest
paid thereon) or credits to the extent such refunds or credits relate to any
Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 8.1.   (b)
The Buyer and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be entitled to any
Tax refunds (including any interest paid thereon) or credits to the extent
such refunds or credits relate to any Taxes for which the Buyer
is responsible pursuant to Section 8.1.   94    8.4 Allowable Taxes.  
(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Allowable Tax" means the allocable share
of any Tax of any Seller or any of the Sellers\' Affiliates which is an
allowable cost under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Chapter
1, and associated regulations and agreements between any Seller and any
U.S. Governmental Entity, allocated based on the Seller\'s existing finance
policy (as it is in effect on the date hereof).   (b) If any Seller or any
of its Affiliates has paid or reimbursed the Buyer for any Allowable Tax for
which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(a), the Buyer
agrees to repay to the Sellers promptly upon receipt any portion of such
Allowable Tax that the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is ultimately able to
recover from a U.S. Governmental Entity.   (c) If the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates receives a refund with respect to an Allowable Tax for which the
Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(a), the Buyer shall pay to
the Sellers the amount of such refund reduced by the amount, if any, that the
Buyer will be required to pay to a U.S. Governmental Entity or suffer by
reason of offset in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48
CFR Chapter 1, and associated regulations and agreements between any Seller
and any U.S. Governmental Entity. If any Seller receives a refund after the
Closing Date with respect to an Allowable Tax for which the Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(a), the Sellers will pay to the Buyer the
amount, if any, which the Buyer will be required to pay to a U.S.
Governmental Entity or suffer by reason of an offset in accordance with the
foregoing regulations and agreements.   (d) The Sellers and the Buyer agree
to cooperate with respect to the calculation of any amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 8.4 and to give each other written    95   notice of
events reasonably likely to result in the increase or decrease of
any Allowable Tax for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section
8.1(a).   8.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits.   (a) The Buyer and
the Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate
in (A) the preparation of all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns),
(B) the preparation and pursuit of any claims for refunds of Taxes, (C) the
defense or administration of any audit, dispute, or similar proceeding with
or by any Governmental Entity responsible for the imposition of any Tax (a
"Taxing Authority") and (D) any proceeding with any U.S. Governmental Entity
relating to refunds or reimbursements for any Allowable Tax, in each case, to
the extent attributable to any Tax period for which one Party
could reasonably require the assistance of another Party in obtaining
necessary information. Such cooperation shall include, without
limitation:   (i) providing all relevant information in the Party\'s
possession including financial data, copies of prior-period Tax Returns
(together with all related schedules and work papers), copies of prior-period
Tax preparation packages, and copies of any notices, rulings, determinations,
or reports from any Taxing Authority to the extent they pertain to the Tax
and Tax period for which the other Party requires assistance;   (ii) the
preparation by employees of Buyer or its Affiliates who were previously
employed by the Sellers in the AIS Business, to the extent they have done so
in the past, of drafts of all or any portion of any Tax Returns and/or Tax
preparation packages with respect to Tax Returns for which the Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (such Tax Returns and Tax preparation
packages to be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice);  
96    (iii) making the Parties\' respective employees and
facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to provide the other
Party access to, or an explanation of, information and documents and to
participate in any proceedings with any Tax Authority or (with respect to
refunds and reimbursements attributable to Allowable Taxes) with any U. S.
Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, the Buyer making
available Mr. Steven Post to the extent that a Seller determines (in its
reasonable discretion) that Mr. Post\'s participation is necessary or
appropriate in connection with any proceeding relating to sales Taxes in the
state of Texas (and any related claim by or against a U.S. Governmental
Entity to the extent such sales Taxes are, or affect the amount of, Allowable
Taxes); and   (iv) promptly forwarding copies of notices, forms, and
other communications received from or sent to any Tax Authority to the extent
such items relate to (or may impact) Taxes for which the other Party is
responsible under Section 8.1.   (b) The Buyer and each Seller shall
maintain all records pertaining to Taxes associated with the operation of the
AIS Business through the Closing for a period of ten years following the
Closing or, if later, until the expiration of the statute of limitations for
collection of the Tax to which such record relates. Prior to discarding or
destroying such records, the Party holding such records shall notify the
other Party or Parties of its intention to so discard or destroy the records.
If the Party receiving such notice so requests, the Party holding such
records shall deliver them to the requesting Party.   (c) In the event that
any Tax is assessed or any refund of Tax is denied, and it is determined that
a substantial reason for such additional Tax or the failure to receive the
refund was another Party\'s failure to maintain or deliver the records
specified in Section 8.5(b), or its    97   failure to fully or timely
cooperate in accordance with Section 8.5(a), then such other Party shall pay
the amount of such assessed Tax or the amount of such disallowed Tax refund
to the Party with respect to which the Tax was assessed or the refund was
denied together with such additional amount as may be necessary to pay any
Taxes that may be attributable to payments under this Section 8.5(c). If the
Parties cannot agree as to whether a failure to maintain or deliver records
or to cooperate constituted a "substantial reason" for the assessment of the
additional Tax or the denial of the Tax refund, such determination shall
be made by the Neutral Accountant in accordance with the procedure set forth
in Section 1.4(d).   8.6 Scope of Article VIII. Any claim by any Party
relating to a breach by another Party of their obligations under this Article
VIII shall be pursued in accordance with the procedures for indemnification
claims, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions, set forth
in Article VII. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term or condition
of Article VII, (i) claims for a breach of an obligation under this Article
VIII may be made by a Party any time prior to the 60th day after the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the Tax matter to
which the claim relates and (ii) to the extent there is any inconsistency
between the terms of Article VII and this Article VIII with respect to the
allocation of responsibility between the Sellers and the Buyer for Taxes
relating to the AIS Business, the provisions of this Article VIII shall
govern.   ARTICLE IX   EMPLOYEE MATTERS   9.1 Pre-Closing Conduct; Other
Liabilities. For purposes of this Agreement, "AIS Employees" means those
employees engaged exclusively or primarily in the AIS Business as of   
98   the Closing Date, including BBJ Employees (as defined in Section
9.2(b)), but excluding those employees listed on Schedule 9.1. None of the
Sellers shall be under any obligation to terminate the employment of any AIS
Employee prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be liable, and shall
hold the Buyer harmless, for all amounts to which any AIS Employee becomes
entitled under any Employee Benefit Plan that exists or arises (or may be
deemed to exist or arise) under any applicable law or otherwise, as a result
of, or in connection with, (i) the employment of any AIS Employee by a Seller
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) the termination of employment of any AIS
Employee prior to the Closing Date, (iii) the termination of employment of
any AIS Employee on or after the Closing Date that is a result of any such
AIS Employee\'s failure to accept an offer of employment made by the Buyer in
accordance with Section 9.2(a), and (iv) the termination of employment of any
LTD AIS Employee (as defined in Section 9.2(a)) on or after the Closing Date.
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer shall be
liable, and shall hold the Sellers harmless, for any amounts to which any AIS
Employee becomes entitled under any Employee Benefit Plan that exists or
arises (or may be deemed to exist or arise) under any applicable law or
otherwise, as a result of, or in connection with, (i) the employment of any
AIS Employee by the Buyer on or after the Closing Date and (ii) the
termination of employment of any AIS Employee on or after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Assumption Agreement to the
contrary, the Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of retention
bonuses under the "stay pay" agreements listed on Schedule 2.12 that become
payable as a result of the Closing and for any obligations referred to in
such agreements relating to Raytheon stock options, and the Buyer shall be
responsible for the    99   payment obligations under such "stay pay"
agreements that become payable upon the completion of specified employment
periods following the Closing.   9.2 Offer of Employment; Continuation of
Employment.   (a) The Parties hereto intend that there shall be continuity
of employment with respect to all AIS Employees (including those employees
who are, as of the Closing Date, on vacation, leave of absence or short-term
disability, but excluding those employees who are, as of the Closing Date, on
long-term disability or layoff). The Buyer shall offer employment commencing
on the Closing Date to all such AIS Employees, on the terms set forth in
Section 9.5. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Buyer shall offer
employment to any AIS Employee on long-term disability who becomes able to
return to work within two years after the Closing Date only in the event and
to the extent that a position comparable to the position such AIS Employee
held prior to such long-term disability is available at the time such AIS
Employee becomes able to return to work or subsequently becomes available
during such two-year period. In addition, if the Buyer increases employment,
the Buyer shall first offer employment to individuals on layoff and shall
comply with all applicable provisions regarding returning to work after
layoff in any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Those persons who
accept the Buyer\'s offer of employment shall hereafter be referred to as
"Transferred Employees." Those AIS Employees on long-term disability who
become able to return to work within two years after the Closing Date but for
whom the Buyer has no comparable position (as described above) are defined as
"LTD AIS Employees".   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "BBJ Employees"
means those employees listed on Schedule 9.2(b). The Buyer shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to    100   retain the services of the
BBJ Employees to the extent necessary to perform the Buyer\'s obligations
under Section 10.10 and the Business Jet Services Agreement. Raytheon agrees
to reimburse the Buyer for the amount of any severance costs, determined in
accordance with the Employee Benefit Plans of the Sellers applicable to AIS
Employees as of the date of this Agreement, relating to the termination
within one year following the Closing Date by the Buyer of any
BBJ Employees.   9.3 Savings Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall take such action, if any, as may be necessary (i) to cause the
active participation of the Transferred Employees under the Raytheon Savings
and Investment Plan (the "Savings Plan") to cease as of the Closing Date, and
(ii) to permit Transferred Employees to elect to take distributions (subject
to applicable law) of their entire accounts thereunder and, if such
Transferred Employees so elect, to roll them over, directly or otherwise, in
accordance with applicable law and regulations, to an individual retirement
account or to one or more defined contribution retirement plans qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and maintained by the Buyer or one of its
subsidiaries (the "Buyer Defined Contribution Plans"), and the Buyer Defined
Contribution Plans shall, to the extent such distributions are in cash or
plan loans, accept such rollovers.   9.4 Defined Benefit Plans. The Sellers
shall retain all liability and responsibility for the defined benefit pension
plans maintained by the Sellers in which Transferred Employees participate as
of the Closing ("Sellers\' Pension Plans"), with respect to those AIS
Employees (or their beneficiaries) who, as of the Closing Date, are
participants in the Sellers\' Pension Plans. The Buyer shall establish,
effective as of the Closing Date, defined benefit pension plans (the "Buyer
Pension Plans") identical in all respects to the Retirement Plan for Hourly
Employees of    101   the Greenville Division (the "Union Pension Plan")
and those Sellers\' Pension Plans in which AIS Employees participate , except
benefits accrued under the Buyer\'s Plans shall be offset by the benefits
accrued under the respective Seller\'s Plans. The Buyer Pension Plan covering
AIS Employees who participated in the Union Pension Plan shall be maintained
in effect without change (except for changes agreed to by the Union
representing the plan participants or as are otherwise permitted or required
under the applicable collective bargaining agreement or applicable law) until
August 21, 2004, or such later date to which the collective bargaining
agreement may be extended. All of the other Buyer Pension Plans (the "Buyer
Non-Union Plans") shall be maintained in effect for at least 15 months after
the Closing Date without substantive change (other than as may be required by
applicable law). Without limiting the generality of this Section 9.4, at all
times during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
15 months after the Closing Date, the total benefits payable to any
Transferred Employee participating under the Buyer Pension Plans,
when combined with the total benefits payable under the Sellers\' Pension
Plans, shall be no less than the total benefits which would have been payable
to such Transferred Employee under the provisions of the Sellers\' Pension
Plans as in effect as of the Closing Date if such Transferred Employee had
continued to be employed by the Sellers.   9.5 Compensation; Employee
Benefits; Severance Plans. Except as otherwise provided in this Article IX or
as otherwise required by applicable law, the Transferred Employees shall
cease to participate in or accrue further benefits under the AIS Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Closing. Beginning at the Closing, the Buyer
shall, for a period ending on the date 15 months after the Closing Date, (a)
provide each Transferred Employee who is not    102   a member of a unit
of employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement with total cash
compensation (defined as base salary and bonus opportunity at least equal to
those in effect on the date hereof) that is no less favorable in the
aggregate than such Transferred Employee\'s total cash compensation
(as defined above) immediately prior to the Closing Date, (b) maintain (or
cause its subsidiaries to maintain) Employee Benefit Plans (including without
limitation, defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and excess
plans, but excluding stock-based plans), for the benefit of each Transferred
Employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the Employee
Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to
employees of the Buyer ("Buyer Plans"), (c) maintain (or cause its
subsidiaries to maintain) a Severance Pay Plan, program or practice for the
benefit of each Transferred Employee that is no less favorable than the plan,
program or practice in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with
respect to such Transferred Employee, and (d) provide the Transferred
Employee company-paid retiree medical benefits that are substantially
comparable in value to such benefits as are provided to the Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing and continue such company-paid
retiree medical benefits for as long as retiree medical benefits are provided
generally to other employees of the Buyer, its successors and
its Subsidiaries during such 15-month period. Subsequent to the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall retain no liability for provision of retiree medical
benefits to the Transferred Employees, all of such liability, if any, having
been assumed by the Buyer. The Buyer shall cause each Buyer Plan to recognize
all credited service for purposes of eligibility and vesting and level of
benefits (including, to the extent required to meet the Buyer\'s obligations
under Section 9.4, accrual of benefits under any defined benefit plan);
provided, however, that the Buyer shall not be required to provide any of the
Transferred    103   Employees with any stock-based plans relating to
equity securities (or their equivalent, such as phantom stock plans or SAR\'s
). Nothing herein shall preclude the Sellers from continuing to administer
stock-based and incentive plans for service by the Transferred Employees with
the Sellers through the Closing Date.   9.6 Welfare Plans. With respect to
any Buyer Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA) or any Buyer Plan that would be a "welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) if it were subject to ERISA, the Buyer
shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, such employees with respect to similar plans maintained by any Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall cooperate with the
Sellers, which shall make appropriate arrangements to allow the use
by Transferred Employees of any accrued benefits under any cafeteria plan
(as defined in Section 125 of the Code for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs) which was maintained by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
for such Transferred Employees.   9.7 Accrued Paid Time Off. With respect
to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any Transferred Employee is
entitled pursuant to the Sellers\' paid time off policies applicable to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "PTO
Policies"), the Buyer shall assume the liability for such accrued paid time
off and allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued paid time off;
provided, however, that if the Buyer deems it necessary to disallow such
Transferred Employee from taking such accrued paid time off, the Buyer shall
permit each such Transferred Employee to carry over paid time off in   
104   accordance with the terms of the PTO Policies; and provided, further,
that the Buyer shall be liable for and pay in cash an amount equal to such
accrued paid time off to any Transferred Employee whose employment terminates
for any reason subsequent to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be liable
for and pay in cash to the Buyer, within ten Business Days after receipt from
the Buyer of written notice thereof accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation, the amount of any accrued but unused paid time off, which is
not accounted for on the Final Closing Statement, to which any such
Transferred Employees are entitled pursuant to the Sellers\' paid time off
policies applicable to such Transferred Employees.   9.8 WARN Act. The Buyer
agrees to provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and any other applicable similar state
or local law and to otherwise comply with any applicable statute with respect
to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff\' (as defined in WARN or other
applicable state or local statutes) or similar event affecting employees and
occurring on or after the Closing Date or arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer shall assume sole responsibility
for any liabilities or obligations arising under WARN or other applicable law
resulting from the actions (or inactions) of the Buyer or its Affiliates on
or after the Closing Date or from the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Sellers agree to provide any required notice under WARN and any other
applicable law and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in WARN) or similar
event affecting employees and occurring prior to the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall assume sole responsibility for any liabilities or obligations
arising under WARN or other applicable law resulting from the actions (or
inactions) of the Sellers or their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date.  
105    9.9 COBRA. The Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA") and any
other applicable law on or after the Closing Date related to Transferred
Employees who are entitled to such notices after the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall assume sole responsibility for any liabilities or obligations arising
under COBRA or other applicable law related to Transferred Employees who are
entitled to such notices after the Closing Date which result from the actions
(or inactions) of the Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date or
from the transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE X   OTHER POST-
CLOSING COVENANTS   10.1 Access to Information; Record Retention;
Cooperation.   (a) Access to Information. Subject to compliance with
contractual obligations and applicable laws and regulations regarding
classified information and security clearance, following the Closing, each
Party shall afford to each other Party and to such other Party\'s authorized
accountants, counsel and other designated representatives, during normal
business hours in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of business, (i) reasonable access and duplicating rights to all non-
privileged records, books, contracts, instruments, documents, correspondence,
computer data and other data and information (collectively, "Information")
within the possession or control of such Party relating to the AIS Business,
and (ii) reasonable access to the personnel of such Party. Requests may be
made under this Section 10.1(a) for financial reporting and accounting
matters, preparing financial statements, preparing, reviewing and analyzing
the Closing Statement, resolving any differences between the Parties   
106   with respect to the Closing Statement, preparing and filing of any
Tax Returns, prosecuting any claims for refund, defending any Tax claims or
assessment, preparing securities law or securities exchange filings,
prosecuting, defending or settling any litigation, Environmental Matter or

Ancillary Agreements, and all other proper business purposes.   (b)
Preparation of Seller Financial Statements. Without limiting the generality
of Section 10.1(a), from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall
request its auditors to, reasonably cooperate on a timely basis with
the Sellers and their auditors in connection with the preparation by Raytheon
of the (i) Closing Statement and (ii) financial statements of Raytheon and
its Affiliates. In connection with the preparation of (i) the Closing
Statement and (ii) such financial statements, the Buyer shall provide
Raytheon (and its auditors) with reasonable access to the AIS Business, its
financial management, and any accountant\'s work papers in the possession of
the Buyer (and shall request that the Buyer\'s auditors provide access to
their work papers), and all financial books, accounts and records relating to
the AIS Business.   (c) Preparation of Buyer Financial Statements. Without
limiting the generality of Section 10.1(a), from and after the Closing, each
of the Sellers agrees that it shall, and shall request PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP to, reasonably cooperate on a timely basis with the Buyer and the
Buyer\'s auditors to prepare audited financial statements of the AIS Business
that are required for SEC filings required to be made by the Buyer and take
any further actions in connection therewith as set forth in Section
4.9(a).   107    (d) Cooperation in Litigation. Without limiting the
generality of Section 10.1(a), from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall
provide such cooperation as the Sellers shall reasonably request in
connection with the Bombardier Litigation. Such cooperation shall include
providing the Sellers and their counsel and other designated representatives
access to such Information and personnel as the Sellers may reasonably
request. The Parties also agree specifically that all Information concerning
the Sustained Readiness Program for modification and refurbishment of P-3
Orion Aircraft for the United States Navy (the "P-3 SRP Program") shall be
stored in the same manner as at the time of the Closing at a location to
which the Seller will have full access upon seven days advance written
notification to the Buyer. The Buyer will not destroy or dispose of any P-3
SRP Program Information without 30 days prior written notice to Raytheon.
Upon receipt of such notice, Raytheon may require that all or part of the P-3
SRP Program Information be delivered to it.   (e) Reimbursement. A Party
making Information or personnel available to another Party under Section 10.1
shall be entitled to receive from such other Party, upon the presentation of
invoices therefor, payments for such amounts, relating to supplies,
disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses, as may reasonably be incurred
in making such Information or personnel available; provided, however, that no
such reimbursements shall be required for the salary or cost of fringe
benefits or similar expenses pertaining to employees of the providing
Party.   (f) Retention of Records. Except as may otherwise be required by
law or agreed to in writing by the Parties, and except as provided in Section
8.5 with respect to Tax records, each Party shall each use reasonable
commercial efforts to preserve, until the date six    108   years after
the Closing Date, all Information in its possession pertaining to the AIS
Business prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu
of retaining any specific Information, any Party may offer in writing to the
other Party or Parties to deliver such Information to the other Party or
Parties and, if such offer is not accepted within 90 days, the offered
Information may be disposed of at any time.   (g) Confidentiality. Each
Party shall hold, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause their
respective Affiliates, consultants, advisors, agents and representatives to
hold, in strict confidence all Information concerning the other furnished to
it by the other Party or Parties or their representatives pursuant to this
Section 10.1 (except to the extent that such Information (i) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of any action or
inaction by the receiving Party, (ii) was within the possession of the
receiving Party prior to it being furnished to the receiving Party by or on
behalf of the disclosing Party pursuant hereto, provided that the source of
such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any person
or entity with respect to such information), or (iii) is or becomes available
on a non-confidential basis to the receiving Party from a source other than
the disclosing Party, provided that the source of such information was
not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal
or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any person or entity with
respect to such information), and each Party shall not release or disclose
such Information to any other person, except its auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and advisors, unless
compelled to disclose such Information by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of law or so as not to violate the rules of
any    109   stock exchange; provided, however, that in the case of
disclosure compelled by judicial or administrative process, the receiving
Party shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) notify the disclosing
Party promptly of the request and the documents requested thereby so that the
disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other
appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Party is, in the written opinion of
its counsel, compelled to disclose any Information to any tribunal or other
entity or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty,
such Party may so disclose the Information without liability hereunder;
provided, however, that, such Party gives written notice to the other Party
or Parties of the information to be disclosed (including copies of the
relevant portions of the relevant documents) as far in advance of
its disclosure as is practicable, uses all reasonable efforts to limit any
such disclosure to the precise terms of such requirement and cooperates with
the disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
information by the tribunal or other entity.   10.2 Covenant Not to
Compete. During the period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing
until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Noncompetition
Period"), Raytheon shall not (and shall cause each Raytheon Subsidiary (as
defined below) not to), directly or indirectly, engage in any of the
following (the "Restricted Business"):   (i) aircraft modification (i.e.,
alterations to an aircraft that permit the integration of electronic
equipment such as sensors, consoles and communications suites) and
maintenance as related to the modification or refurbishment of aircraft owned
and/or operated by    110   the U.S. and foreign governments and
associated with U.S. and foreign Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR);   (ii) aircraft modification (i.e., alterations to an
aircraft that permit the integration of electronic equipment such as sensors,
consoles and communications suites) and refurbishment, life extension and
special mission aircraft management;   (iii) development and integration of

Raytheon or Raytheon Subsidiaries; and   (v) maintenance, repair,
modification, fabrication, prototyping and manufacturing, and logistics
support that is currently performed by the AIS Business Joint Operations
Group, for Special Operations Forces Equipment.  For purposes of this
Agreement, "Raytheon Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or other non-corporate business enterprise in which
Raytheon (or another Raytheon Subsidiary) holds stock or other ownership
interests representing more than 50% of the voting power of all outstanding
stock or ownership interests of such entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Raytheon nor any Raytheon Subsidiary shall be prohibited from:  
(a) continuing to engage in any type of business conducted by Raytheon or any
Raytheon Subsidiary as of the date hereof which is not part of the
AIS Business or which is part of the Boeing Business Jet Division (as such
business exists as of the date of this    111   Agreement), or selling
products or services that are under development by Raytheon or any Raytheon
Subsidiary as of the date hereof which are not part of the AIS Business (it
being agreed that the type of business conducted by Raytheon or any Raytheon
Subsidiary shall include any type of business that is either expressly
addressed in a bid or contract of Raytheon or any Raytheon Subsidiary
existing as of the date hereof or that is a logical follow-on to business
that is expressly addressed in such an existing bid or contract);   (b)
purchasing products or services from, or selling products or services to, or
otherwise engaging in a commercial relationship with, an entity which is
engaged in the Restricted Business;   (c) acquiring or owning less than 5%
(by voting power) of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly-traded
company which is engaged in the Restricted Business;   (d) performing its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise
taking actions in connection with the winding up of the AIS Business; or  
(e) acquiring any entity which is engaged in the Restricted Business if
either:   (i) in its last full fiscal year prior to such acquisition,
the consolidated revenues of such entity from the Restricted Business
constituted less than 25% of the total revenues of such entity; or   (ii)
Raytheon or the applicable Raytheon Subsidiary thereafter uses, until the
earlier to occur of the expiration of the Noncompetition Period and 12 months
after such acquisition, reasonable commercial efforts to sell that portion of
the business of such entity as    112   constitutes the Restricted
Business, upon terms and conditions and at a price deemed acceptable by
Raytheon.   10.3 Novation of Government Contracts.   (a) As soon as
practicable following the Closing, the applicable Seller shall prepare (with
the Buyer\'s assistance, which will include preparation of all information
and documents required of the transferee for such requests), in accordance
with Federal Acquisition Regulations, 48 CFR ss.42.12, and any applicable
agency regulations or policies, a written request meeting the requirements of
the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 42, as reasonably interpreted by the
Responsible Contracting Officer (as such term is defined in Federal
Acquisition Regulations Part 42), which shall be submitted by such Seller to
each Responsible Contracting Officer, for the applicable U.S. Governmental
Entity (i) to recognize the Buyer as such Seller\'s successor-in-interest to
each Government Contract and (ii) to enter into a novation agreement (a
"Novation Agreement"), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer and such Seller, pursuant to which, subject to the requirements of the
Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 42, all of such Seller\'s right, title
and interest in and to, and all of such Seller\'s obligations and liabilities
under, such Government Contract shall be validly conveyed, transferred and
assigned and novated to the Buyer by all parties thereto. The Sellers and the
Buyer shall each use all reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals
and waivers required for the purpose of processing, entering into and
completing the Novation Agreements with regard to any such Government
Contracts, including responding to any requests for information by a U.S.
Governmental Entity with regard to such Novation Agreements. The Sellers and
the Buyer shall promptly provide to each other (or to the requesting U.S.
Governmental Entity) any    113   information with respect to such Party
required in connection with any such request for information.   (b) The
Parties acknowledge that the transfer or assignment of a Government Contract
is subject to the contracting agency\'s approval of a Novation Agreement
recognizing the Buyer as the successor-in-interest to the applicable Seller.
Unless and until the contracting agency recognizes the Buyer as the
successor-in-interest to the applicable Seller under any Government Contract,
then the applicable Seller shall subcontract, sublease or lease to the Buyer
all of such Seller\'s rights and obligations under such Government
Contract and appoint the Buyer as the agent of the applicable Seller for
purposes of such Government Contract, or otherwise cooperate in any
reasonable arrangement designed to provide the benefits of such Government
Contract to the Buyer (provided the Buyer also discharges the applicable
Seller\'s obligations under such Government Contract), in each case to the
maximum extent permissible under law. In connection therewith, the Buyer
shall perform on behalf of such Seller all of such Seller\'s obligations
under such Government Contract, and such Seller shall remit to the Buyer all
payments it receives under such Government Contract with respect to
obligations performed by the Buyer (less any additional costs incurred by
such Seller in connection therewith).   (c) In connection with obtaining the
consents or approvals contemplated in Sections 10.3(a) and 10.3(b), none of
the Sellers shall consent to any modification of any Government Contract
which would adversely affect the rights of the Buyer under such Government
Contract without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which shall not be
withheld or delayed if such modification is not material).   114    10.4
Seller Guarantees. In the event that after the Closing Date any Seller or an
Affiliate is required to reimburse a letter of credit issuer for any drawing
under a Seller Guarantee, or is required to make any payment under a Seller
Guarantee (other than carrying costs), then the Buyer shall reimburse such
Seller or Affiliate within 20 days after demand for the payment of
such amount. The Buyer\'s payment obligation under this Section 10.4 shall
not be subject to any right of set-off or defense to payment otherwise
available to the Buyer. However, the payment by the Buyer of any such payment
obligation will not constitute a waiver by the Buyer of any of its rights to
make a subsequent claim under Article VII, to the extent applicable.   10.5
Outstanding Bid Proposals.   (a) In the event that, as of the Closing Date,
the AIS Business has furnished any proposals to another business unit of
Raytheon to provide products and services to such other business unit in
connection with a Bid Proposal (as defined below) by such other business
unit, the Buyer agrees that if such Bid Proposal is accepted, the Buyer will
honor such proposal by the AIS Business in accordance with its terms, which
will be performed pursuant to the terms of the applicable Supply Agreement,
or if no Supply Agreement applies to the applicable scope of work, pursuant
to a new supply agreement in a form and with terms substantially equivalent
to the Supply Agreements; provided, however, that (i) with respect to
proposals by the AIS Business to another business unit of Raytheon in
connection with a fixed-price Bid Proposal, the Buyer hereby waives any right
to claim or otherwise collect Statistical Profit under such proposals, and
(ii) with respect to proposals by the AIS Business to another business
unit of Raytheon in connection with a cost-plus Bid Proposal, the profit
margin for such proposals that    115   include cost-plus pricing with
a Statistical Profit, or no provision for profit, shall be paid by such
business unit of Raytheon to the Buyer in a percentage equal to the fee
percentage in the prime or higher tier contract for the applicable cost-plus
Bid Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Bid Proposal" means a proposal
that has been submitted to a customer of Raytheon, a Raytheon Subsidiary or
the AIS Business. The Buyer\'s obligations under this Section 10.5(a) shall
apply only to Bid Proposals that are listed on Schedule 10.5(a) and are (i)
outstanding on the date of this Agreement or (ii) become outstanding prior to
the Closing with the consent of the Buyer. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Statistical Profit" means, with respect to proposals furnished by one party
to another party to provide products or services in connection with a Bid
Proposal by such other party, an amount equal to the fee uplift constituting
the profit which would have been recorded by the party supplying such
products or services for financial reporting purposes internal to the Sellers
pursuant to Raytheon General Policies and Procedures 23-2003-110, but which
the party receiving such products or services would not have paid to
the supplying party, if the Buyer and the Sellers had remained
Affiliates.   (b) In the event that, as of the Closing Date, Raytheon or a
Raytheon Subsidiary has furnished any proposals to the AIS Business to
provide products and services to the AIS Business in connection with a Bid
Proposal by the AIS Business, Raytheon agrees that if such Bid Proposal is
accepted, Raytheon will, or will cause the applicable Raytheon Subsidiary to,
honor such proposal in accordance with its terms, which will be performed
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Supply Agreement or if no Supply
Agreement applies to the applicable scope of work, pursuant to a new supply
agreement in a form and with terms substantially equivalent to the Supply
Agreements; provided, however, that (i) with respect to proposals by   
116   Raytheon or a Raytheon Subsidiary to the AIS Business in connection
with a fixed-price Bid Proposal, Raytheon hereby waives, or will cause its
Raytheon Subsidiary to waive, any right to claim or otherwise collect
Statistical Profit under such proposals, and (ii) with respect to proposals
by Raytheon or a Raytheon Subsidiary to the AIS Business in connection with a
cost-plus Bid Proposal, the profit margin for such proposals that include
cost-plus pricing with fiscal or statistical profit, or no provision for
profit, shall be paid by the Buyer to Raytheon or the Raytheon Subsidiary, as
applicable, in a percentage equal to the fee percentage in the prime or
higher tier contract for the applicable cost-plus Bid Proposal. Raytheon\'s
obligations under this Section 10.5(b) shall apply only to Bid Proposals
which are listed on Schedule 10.5(b) and (i) are outstanding on the date of
this Agreement or (ii) become outstanding prior to the Closing with the
consent of Raytheon.   10.6 Use of Raytheon Name in Transferred Technology.
The Sellers and the Buyer will cooperate and use reasonable commercial
efforts to provide to the Buyer for inclusion in its web site, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing, all text, images and other content
contained in all web sites relating exclusively or primarily to the AIS
Business maintained by the Sellers (or their Affiliates). Prior to including
any such text, images or other content in its web site, the Buyer shall
remove all references to the "Raytheon" and "E-Systems" names from any such
text, images or other content, except that the Buyer may use such names in a
non-trademark sense to describe the historical affiliation of the AIS
Business. The Sellers (or their Affiliates) shall retain ownership of all
domain names employing the name Raytheon or E-Systems and neither the Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right or license to any such domain
name. To the extent the AIS Business utilized any internet protocol address
space allocated to    117   the Sellers, such internet protocol address
space shall remain the property of the Sellers, and no rights or licenses are
granted to the Buyer with respect thereto. Except as may be provided in this
Section 10.6 or the Transition Services Agreement, the Buyer shall have no
right to continued access to the Raytheon telephone network, Raytheon
internet mail, or any other Raytheon computer network.   10.7 Collection of
Accounts Receivable. Each Seller agrees that it shall forward promptly to the
Buyer any monies, checks or instruments received by such Seller after the
Closing with respect to the accounts receivable purchased by the Buyer from
the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement. Each Seller hereby authorizes the
Buyer to endorse and cash any checks or instruments payable or endorsed to
such Seller or its order which are received by the Buyer and which relate to
accounts receivable purchased by the Buyer from the Sellers.   10.8 Payment
of Assumed Liabilities. In the event that any Seller (or an Affiliate
thereof) inadvertently pays or discharges, after the Closing, any Assumed
Liabilities, the Buyer shall reimburse such Seller or Affiliate for
the amount so paid or discharged within 45 days of being presented with
written evidence of such payment or discharge. In the event that the Buyer
(or an Affiliate thereof) inadvertently pays or discharges, after the
Closing, any Excluded Liabilities, the applicable Seller shall reimburse the
Buyer or such Affiliate for the amount so paid or discharged within 45 days
of being presented with written evidence of such payment or discharge.  
10.9 Access to Facility. In order to permit the Sellers to continue
to conduct Raytheon\'s operations relating to payroll processing,
PeopleSoft support, Enterprise IT SAP support and CSC support services
located at Raytheon\'s Greenville, Texas facilities (which   
118   facilities are covered by one of the Real Estate Leases being
assigned to the Buyer), the Buyer shall, for a period of one year following
the Closing (or such shorter period of time as the Sellers shall elect with
respect to all or any portion of the space so occupied), permit the Sellers
to continue to occupy the amount of space at the Greenville facilities
currently occupied by the Raytheon operations described above, and permit the
Sellers\' employees, agents and contractors to have access both to such
portion of such facilities as is reasonably necessary to operate such
functions in the manner in which they are currently operated and to such
services, equipment and systems as are currently utilized by them in such
operations. The Sellers shall make all reasonable efforts to avoid and
mitigate any interruption or interference with the Buyer\'s business
activities. As consideration for the access permitted by the Buyer under this
Section 10.9, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer a pro rata portion (based on
the portion of the Greenville facilities occupied by the Sellers) of (i) the
payments owed by the Buyer under such Real Estate Lease and (ii) any other
costs reasonably incurred by the Buyer in operating and maintaining
such facilities and providing support for the occupants thereof, for the
period of time during which the Sellers occupy such facilities. The Seller
shall indemnify the Buyer for any Damages incurred by the Buyer if the
arrangement contemplated by this Section 10.9 constitutes a violation of such
Real Estate Lease.   10.10 Boeing Business Jet Operations.   (a) Raytheon
is obligated to design, manufacture and deliver a VIP interior in (i) a
Boeing B777-200 Increased Gross Weight (IGW) aircraft under Completion
Agreement Number 98-RESY-W-1057 between Raytheon (as successor to Raytheon
E-Systems, Inc.) and Alfa Sierra, Inc. dated June 5, 1998 and (ii) a Boeing
B737-700 IGW aircraft under Completion    119   Agreement Number
99-RSC-W-1085 between Raytheon (as successor to Raytheon E-Systems, Inc.) and
Funair, Inc. dated April 24, 1999 and Completion Specification, Change dated
January 24, 2000, as revised by Work Change Requests. Such aircrafts are
referred to herein as the "777 Aircraft" and such contracts (as supplemented
or modified) are referred to herein as the "777 Contracts." The Buyer agrees
that, at the request of Raytheon, it shall perform such work as is reasonably
necessary to complete the 777 Aircraft and prepare them for delivery in
accordance with the terms of the 777 Contracts. Raytheon shall pay the Buyer
for such work at a rate equal to the Buyer\'s Actual Cost for the first
15,000 man hours of such work, and at a rate equal to the Buyer\'s Actual
Cost plus 8% for any work in excess of 15,000 man hours. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Actual Cost" shall mean the Buyer\'s actual costs
(including labor and fringes, overhead and general and administrative costs,
plus the actual cost to the Buyer of materials used and applicable material
handling rates and any other direct costs) determined in accordance with the
standards and practices under the Raytheon Company Aircraft Integration
Systems Segment Cost Accounting Standards Board Disclosure Statement (or any
successor thereto) in effect at the time the work is performed, subject to
any limitations agreed to by Raytheon and the Buyer. The Buyer shall perform
such work in accordance with customary standards of quality in the industry
and in accordance with the standards required under the 777 Contracts.  
(b) Raytheon owns supplemental type certificates and data identified on the
applicable Master Drawing List associated with Boeing Business Jet
Model 737-700 aircraft and one Boeing Model 777-200 and excess materials, as
described in more detail on Schedule 10.10(b) (the "Consigned Assets"). The
Consigned Assets are located at Raytheon\'s Waco, Texas facility and are not
part of the Acquired Assets. The Buyer agrees to store the Consigned   
120   Assets for the benefit of Raytheon. The Buyer further agrees to use
reasonable commercial efforts to find a buyer for the Consigned Assets and
agrees that Steven Hannah shall (for so long as he remains employed by the
Buyer or an Affiliate) be responsible for the Buyer\'s efforts to find such
buyer (it being agreed that the foregoing shall not require Buyer to retain
Mr. Hannah as an employee). Raytheon, as owner of the Consigned Assets, shall
have the authority to accept or reject any proposed sale of the Consigned
Assets. Upon the consummation of any sale of some or all of the Consigned
Assets, Raytheon shall pay to the Buyer 40% of the proceeds received by
Raytheon for such sale.   10.11 Insurance. The Sellers shall provide
reasonable cooperation to the Buyer in order to afford the Buyer the right to
receive payment, after the Closing, under any insurance policies of the
Sellers covering the AIS Business or the Acquired Assets prior to the Closing
with respect to any claim or loss covered by such policies that relates to
any of the Acquired Assets or constitutes an Assumed Liability. The Buyer
shall promptly notify the Sellers of the occurrence of any events that might
form the basis of such an insurance claim and the amount of such claim. Any
such rights of the Buyer to receive payment on any such insurance claim shall
be subject to any deductibles, self-insured retentions, retained amounts,
retentions or exclusions, to the Buyer\'s payment of any retrospectively
rated premiums that become due and payable after the Closing, and to the
other terms of the applicable insurance policy. If so requested by Raytheon,
the Buyer shall, as a condition to receiving payment on any such insurance
claim, make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Raytheon for the payment
directly to the applicable insurance carrier of any amounts which are the
responsibility of the Buyer in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. This Section 10.11 shall not require any Seller to convert
any    121   "claims made" policy to an "occurrence based" policy and
shall not obligate any Seller to maintain any insurance policy in effect such
that it covers claims made or events occurring after the Closing.   10.12
Non-Solicitation. From the date hereof to the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, none of the Sellers shall, directly or indirectly
(including through Subsidiaries), solicit or encourage any of the officers
and employees listed on Schedule 10.12 hereto to leave the employ of the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that nothing contained in this
sentence shall prevent or restrict a Seller from employing any individual who
responds to a general solicitation for employment made by or on behalf of any
Seller that is not specifically directed at employees or officers of the
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or any individual who, after the Closing,
initiates contact with a Seller for purposes of seeking employment.   10.13
Record Keeping. Within six months after the Closing, the Sellers shall
deliver to the Buyer all data relating primarily or exclusively to
the Acquired Assets to the extent such transfer is permitted by applicable
law and such data has not be transferred to an AIS Business facility prior to
Closing. Such data includes, but it not limited to, data relating to
financial accounting, real estate leases, human resources, contracts,
insurance, intellectual property, legal matters, novation agreements and
assignment agreements. The costs incurred in connection with the delivery of
such data to the Buyer shall be borne by the Sellers.   10.14 Compliance
with Agreement. The Buyer shall forbear (and shall cause its Affiliates and
any other person or entity under its control to forbear) from taking any
action with respect to any AIS Property that, if taken by Raytheon (as
successor to Raytheon E-Systems, Inc.), would (i) represent a breach of
a covenant of the Seller to Chrysler under the April 4, 1996   
122   Stock Purchase Agreement by and among Chrysler Technologies
Corporation, Cisa Financial Services, S.A. and E-Systems, Inc. (the "Chrysler
Agreement") or (ii) reduce or result in the loss of any indemnity claim or
right of Raytheon pursuant to such Agreement.   10.15 Proprietary
Information; Marketing and Sales Restriction. The Buyer acknowledges that the
AIS Business possesses, and, after the Closing the Buyer will possess,
significant information about non-AIS Business technology, marketing, and
sales that is confidential and trade secret to the Sellers ("Non-AIS
Information"), including, without limitation, Non-AIS Information regarding
the operations of the Sellers at the locations identified in the definition
of the AIS Business set forth in the Introduction to this Agreement. The
Buyer will not, directly or indirectly, use or disclose any Non-
AIS Information for any purpose, specifically including, without
limitation, research, development, marketing or sales efforts in competition
with the Sellers.   10.16 Confidentiality Obligations of the Sellers. The
Sellers shall hold, and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause
their respective Affiliates, consultants, advisors, agents and
representatives to hold, in strict confidence all confidential or trade
secret information relating exclusively or primarily to the AIS Business,
except as required by law or administrative process and except for
information that is available to the public on the Closing Date, or
thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach
of this Section 10.16.   10.17 Environmental Response Activities. In
performing Environmental Response Activities for which it seeks
indemnification under Article VII of this Agreement, Buyer will select the
remedy which most cost effectively achieves the level of cleanup with respect
to which Raytheon owes an indemnity obligation pursuant to Section
7.1(d).   123    ARTICLE XI   MISCELLANEOUS   11.1 Press Releases and
Announcements. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Parties will issue a joint press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, substantially in the form
previously delivered to each other. Prior to the Closing, no Party
shall issue (and each Party shall cause its Affiliates not to issue) any
other press release or public disclosure relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party or
Parties (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided,
however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith is required by law, regulation or stock exchange rule (in which case
the disclosing Party shall advise the other Party or Parties and the other
Party or Parties shall, if practicable, have the right to review such press
release or announcement prior to its publication).   11.2 No Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and, to the extent specified herein, their respective
Affiliates.   11.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or understandings among
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, and any
representations or statements made by or on behalf of any Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates to the Buyer, whether written or oral, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement.   124    11.4 Succession and Assignment. No Party may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of Raytheon (in the case of an
assignment by the Buyer) or the Buyer (in the case of an assignment by any
Seller), which written approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement, and all rights,
interests and obligations hereunder, may be assigned, without such consent,
to any entity that acquires all or substantially all of a Party\'s business
or assets, and the Buyer may assign without the Sellers\' consent all or part
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to one or more subsidiaries

jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the

unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that

of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified.   11.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise

jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter.   127    11.10 Governing
Law. This Agreement and any disputes hereunder (including any arbitration
proceeding pursuant to Section 7.4) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
Delaware.   11.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided

manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 11.5. Nothing in this
Section 11.11, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve such
summons, complaint or initial pleading in any other manner permitted by
law.   11.12 Construction.   (a) The language used in this Agreement shall
