</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the Board of Directors of the

Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;), not owned directly or
indirectly by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company will, by virtue of
the Merger, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the

interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;adopted this Agreement, (iii)&nbsp;directed that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with, and to prescribe certain conditions to, the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Welsh, Carson, Anderson &#038;

the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter, to invest up to $139,000,000 in equity securities of
Parent (or its parent company) in order to allow Parent to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement.

performance brought by the Company against Parent, Merger Sub and Sponsor under <B>Section&nbsp;8.6(d)</B>
above and Section 8(d) of the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company shall, as an alternative
remedy, be entitled to seek monetary damages. If such court has under such circumstance entered a
judgment awarding damages against Parent or Merger Sub, the Company may enforce such judgment as
its sole remedy; <U>provided</U>, that the Company covenants and agrees that it will not seek to
enforce such judgment without giving effect to <B>Section&nbsp;8.15 </B>and until ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after
such judgment is no longer subject to appeal or other review, and then only if Parent and Merger
Sub have not within such ten (10)&nbsp;Business Day period irrevocably committed in writing to the
Company to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
Sponsor has not within such ten (10)&nbsp;Business Day period irrevocably committed in writing to the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, as promptly as
practicable. Should Parent, Merger Sub and the Sponsor express such irrevocable commitments, the
parties hereto will cooperate with one another to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable
and in any event within fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days of the giving of such irrevocable commitments.
If the Merger is not consummated within such fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Day period as the result of the
failure of Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsor to comply with such irrevocable commitments, the
Company shall be entitled to enforce such judgment. The Company agrees to cause any pending
proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the
Merger in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter are
intended to and shall allow the Company only a single recovery against Parent, Merger Sub and the
Sponsor, which recovery under no circumstances shall exceed, in the aggregate, the Parent Liability
Limitation.
