AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 2, 2010 (this "Agreement"), is among GDC Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Royal Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of GeoDigm Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("Merger Sub"), and National Dentex Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms used but not defined elsewhere herein have the meanings assigned to them in Section 8.16. 

  

 The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the Board of Directors of the Company desire that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company enter into a transaction whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and each issued and outstanding share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), not owned directly or indirectly by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company will, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

  

 In furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the Board of the Directors of the Company have determined that entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined and declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted this Agreement, (iii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys stockholders for their approval and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

 Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with, and to prescribe certain conditions to, the Merger. 

  

 Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe XI, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Sponsor"), is entering into an equity commitment letter with Parent, the sole stockholder of Parent, and the Company (the "Equity Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor is committing, subject to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter, to invest up to $139,000,000 in equity securities of Parent (or its parent company) in order to allow Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and
shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as otherwise provided herein. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, and in any event no later than 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, in each case, other than conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions), or such other time and date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms (the actual time and date of the Closing is referred to as the "Closing Date"); _provided_ , that Parent may, by written notice given to the Company, delay the Closing and the Closing Date until the earlier of (A) the Termination Date or (B) a date selected by Parent that is not more than five (5) Business Days after the latest Closing Date otherwise permitted by this Section 1.2, if Parent determines that such delay is necessary or appropriate in order to finalize any debt financing in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 2.1. _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, and enter into an agreement with, a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash sufficient to effect the payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a), Section 1.9 and this Article 2 (including any interest or other earnings therein, the "Exchange Fund" ). 

  

 Section 2.2. _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(a): (a) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent); and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate in the form of a check, to be promptly mailed, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger Consideration. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, then it shall be a 

   ##### 

  

    

condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration that (i) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
have (A) paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment
in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or (B) established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
any such Taxes are not payable. Subject to Section 2.10 hereof, the Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Company Common Stock represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.3. _Undistributed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Certificates on the date that is one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and this Article 2\. Any portion of the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 that remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates on such date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 2.4. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent nor their respective directors, officers, employees and representatives shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Funds as directed by Parent or Surviving Corporation on a daily basis in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America; _provided_ , however, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and this Article 2\. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Article 2, or all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable to promptly pay the amounts contemplated by this Article 2 for any reason, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments contemplated by this Article 2\. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 1.8(a) and this Article 2 shall promptly be paid to Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. 

  

 Section 2.7. _Withholding Rights_. The Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or a Company Equity Award such amount that any of them is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of any other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent (i) such amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing authority and (ii) the amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Award in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall provide to the former holder of such securities written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.

 Section 2.10. _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has prior to the vote for the approval of this Agreement at the Companys Stockholders Meeting, given notice of his, her or its intent to demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the MBCA and has not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the MBCA with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA to a holder of Dissenting Shares. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Company will give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA, any withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA that relate to such demand and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument prior to the Effective Date, and to direct all such negotiations and proceedings after the Effective Date.

 (c) If the Dissenting Shares lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares in accordance with this Article 2\. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply in all respects with Section 13 of the MBCA.

 Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has full corporate or other power and authority to own, operate and lease the properties owned or used by it and to carry on its business as and where such is now being conducted, except where the failure to be in such standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties owned or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the articles of organization and the bylaws, or similar organizational documents, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including any 

   #####

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All of
the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective filing dates (and as of the

the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the

 (c) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of Directors (A) all "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are known to the Company and that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, known to the Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys and its Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date and as of the date hereof, to the knowledge of the Company, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company. The Company has made available or provided access to or otherwise disclosed to Parent all matters referred to in the first sentence of this Section 3.5(c).

 Section 3.6. _Undisclosed Liabilities_.

To the knowledge of the Company, other than Chapters 110C and 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws, there are no takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium, "fair price," "control share," or similar Laws that are applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has validly opted out of the 

    #####

hereby. There are no anti-takeover provisions in the Companys Restated
Articles of Organization or bylaws or similar documents of any Subsidiary of
the Company.

 (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) entitle any Person to (or accelerate the timing of) any material payment, forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, or material increase in benefits under or with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) trigger any obligation to fund any Company Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no payment to be made in connection with a change in control contemplated by this Agreement would fail to be deductible by reason of Code section 280G or result in the imposition of an excise tax on any Person pursuant to Code section 4999.

 Section 5.2. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting_.

Subject to Section 5.5, the Board of Directors, shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the stockholders of the Company vote to approve the Merger and this Agreement (the "Company Recommendation") and will 

   ##### 

  

    

use reasonable best efforts to include the written opinion referred to in
Section 3.21. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each
other and provide reasonable assistance to each other in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide to each other
any information regarding such party that is necessary to include in the
Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Proxy Statement and shall consider in good faith and include such
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (ii) each of Parent and Merger Sub
will furnish to the Company in writing the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
ensure that such information supplied by it in writing specifically for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement which, at the time and in the
light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading
or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter
which has become false or misleading. Subject to Parents and Merger Subs
compliance with this Section 5.2(a), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and
mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after its filing with
the SEC; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be required to mail
the Proxy Statement to its stockholders or to call, give written notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on or prior to the Go-Shop
Period End Date. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide Parent with copies of all written comments, and advise
Parent of all oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement received
from the SEC and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such comments to the Proxy Statement and shall
consider in good faith and include such comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would
not include any statement which, at the time and in the light of the
circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or subject matter which has
become false or misleading, then the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
Law, the Company shall promptly file with the SEC and disseminate to its
stockholders an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and consider in good faith
and include such comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company
shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date that it is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company and as of the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement which, at the time and in the
light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or 

   ##### 

  

    

misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same meeting or
subject matter which has become false or misleading, and (ii) comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
responsible for information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
in writing specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. 

  

 (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the SEC confirm that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement as soon as reasonably practicable after its filing with the SEC and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, duly take, in accordance with all applicable Law, the articles of organization and bylaws of the Company and the Rules of The Nasdaq Global Market, all action necessary to call, give written notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take all reasonable and lawful action to solicit the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote; _provided_ , however, that the Company will not be required to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders, call, give written notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on or prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date. The Company (and its Board of Directors and any special committee thereof formed to evaluate an Acquisition Proposal): (a) shall take all action that is reasonable and lawful to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of this Agreement and the Merger and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote in the manner required by the rules of The Nasdaq Global Market and the MBCA to obtain such approvals and (b) subject to Section 5.5(f) and Section 5.5(g), shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold or modify, the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) with Parents consent, as necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iii) for the duration and pendency of any Notice Period then in effect and for a reasonable time thereafter (not to exceed two (2) Business Days) in order to permit notification to be sent to the Companys stockholders regarding such adjournment or postponement ( _provided_ , however, this clause (iii) shall not apply if Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects in a written notice to the Company to forego any such pending Notice Period). For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company shall be obligated to undertake the foregoing actions described in this Section 5.2 irrespective of whether a Change in Company Recommendation shall have occurred. Parent and the Company shall each be responsible to pay fifty percent (50%) of any and all fees and expenses incurred, indirectly or directly, by the Company in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the holding of the Company Stockholders Meeting, unless this Agreement is 

   ##### 

  

    

terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d), 7.1(e), 7.1(g) or 7.1(h), in
which case the Company shall be solely responsible for such fees and
expenses. 

  

 Section 5.3. _Further Information._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, afford Parent and its counsel, accountants, consultants, other authorized Representatives and prospective lenders, financing sources and their Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, subject in each case to such reasonable limitations on the time of day and the manner of the access to maintain confidentiality, to the officers, employees, properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct their review in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and _provided_ _further_ , however, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection or disclose any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties in violation of a confidentiality obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries officers and employees to furnish such financial and operating data and other information as may be reasonably requested by Parent from time to time. All of the requirements of this Section 5.3 shall be subject to: (i) any prohibitions or limitations of applicable Law, (ii) the terms of any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to the extent disclosure thereof to Parent would reasonably be expected to violate the terms of such Contract (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation or prohibition), (iii) any restrictions which the Company reasonably believes are necessary to preserve the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.4. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Sections 5.4(c) and 5.5, each of the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the other party, and shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to) use all of their respective reasonable best efforts, to promptly: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain and maintain all (A) approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any other Person, including any Governmental Entity, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) any notices or consents disclosed or required to be disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule or required to prevent the occurrence of an event reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their respective rights, properties or assets) after the Effective Time, in each case, in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in any event before the Termination Date. Subject to Section 5.4(c), except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall not, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to, take any action or knowingly omit to take any action 

   ##### 

  

    

within its reasonable control where such action or omission would, or would
reasonably be expected to, result in (A) any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied prior to the Termination Date or
(B) a material delay in the satisfaction of such conditions. 

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, each party hereto shall (and/or, if applicable, cause its ultimate parent to) file with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") a Notification and Report Form relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early termination thereunder; _provided_ , however, that the parties shall not be required to file such Notification and Report Forms until the second Business Day after the Go-Shop Period End Date unless Parent shall elect otherwise and notifies the Company in writing a reasonable period of time prior to filing. Each party shall promptly supply the other party with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such filing and supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of all filing fees under the HSR Act. 

  

 (c) In connection with this Section 5.4, the parties hereto shall (and/or, if applicable, cause its ultimate parent to) (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing, submission, investigation or inquiry related to the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication (written or oral) received by such party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ, FTC or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication (written or oral) received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not expressly prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ , that all such obligations pursuant to clause (i)-(iv) above shall be deemed void or limited if or to the extent such actions would in the opinion of the applicable partys outside legal counsel violate any applicable Law; and _provided_ , further, that no party shall be required to, and the Company (and, with respect to the effects listed in clauses (i) and (ii) below, Parent) shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to (without the prior written consent of Parent or the Company, as the case may be), enter into any agreements or commitments or take any other actions to resolve any such objections or actions if such agreement, commitment or other action would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to (i) prevent consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) result in any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement being rescinded following the Effective Time, (iii) limit or otherwise adversely affect the right of Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) to own or vote 

   ##### 

  

    

any shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, control the
Surviving Corporation or operate all or any portion of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) require or compel the Company, any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, Parent or any Affiliate of Parent to dispose of
all or any portion of its properties or assets. The parties hereto may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as "Outside
Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel (and experts and consultants retained
by such outside counsel) of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

foregoing. 

  

 (c) If at any time following the Go-Shop Period End Date and prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a third party (other than a written Acquisition Proposal that was intentionally or knowingly solicited in violation of this Agreement or that directly or indirectly resulted from a material breach of this Section 5.5) that (i) the Board of Directors believes in good faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with or in violation of the directors fiduciary duty under applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposals) with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company (x) shall not, and shall not allow any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to, disclose or make available any non-public information to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide or make available to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company provided or made available to such other Person which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

Any determination by the Board of Directors that any such Acquisition Proposal received prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date meets the requirements described in this Section 5.5(d)(i) shall be made not later than 48 hours after the Go-Shop Period End Date. No later than 72 hours following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of

all Acquisition Proposals from Continuing Parties. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.5(d) to the contrary, any Continuing Party shall cease to be a Continuing Party for all purposes under this Agreement at such time as its Acquisition Proposal fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 5.5(c)(i) and (ii) or otherwise expires or is withdrawn. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing when a Continuing Party ceases to be a Continuing Party. Subject to Section 5.5(c), at the Go-Shop Period End Date, other than with respect to Continuing Parties, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and use its (and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to use their) commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information provided or made available to such Person on behalf of the Company. 

  

 (e) After the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent in writing if it receives (or after it becomes aware that one of its Representatives has received): (A) an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons (other than a Continuing Party) or written or verbal indication that such Person or group is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making or proposing to make such Acquisition Proposal, to the extent known, (B) any request by any Person or group of related Persons for non-public information relating to the Company other than requests in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices, and reasonably believed by the Company to be unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal or (C) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal by any Person or group of related Persons. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall inform Parent in writing within 48 hours, in the event that it determines to begin providing information or engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.5(c).

Proposal that has been publicly made or publicly disclosed or announced and
not withdrawn; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation during any pending Notice
Period; and _provided further_ , the foregoing proviso shall not apply if
Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects in a written notice to
the Company to forego any such pending Notice Period), or (v) fail to
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under
the Exchange Act (whether or not applicable) in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement filed on Schedule 14D-9 or other public
communication by or on behalf of the Company with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act shall not constitute a failure for purposes of clause (iv) above
or this clause (v)) (each of the actions or omissions described in clauses
(i) through (v) above, a "Change in Company Recommendation"); _provided_ ,
that at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal (including from a Continuing
Party) after the date hereof and the Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to effect a Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the fulfillment of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Board may (i) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(h) to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii) effect a Change in Company
Recommendation; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) shall be void and
of no force and effect, unless concurrently with such termination the Company
pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 7.2(c);  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i) and the Board of Directors may not effect a Change in

Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall include a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group
of Persons making such Superior Proposal and any other material documents
relating thereto. During the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good
faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity
Commitment Letter, and the Board of Directors shall take into account any
changes to the financial and other terms of this Agreement and the Equity
Commitment Letter proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by
the Company in evaluating whether the Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new Notice
Period, except that such new Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days;
and _provided_ , further, that the Company shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) in order to

Proposal was knowingly and intentionally solicited in violation of this
Agreement or that directly or indirectly resulted from a material breach of
this Section 5.5). 

  

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Board of Directors may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote and solely in response to an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Company Recommendation, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of its fiduciary duties; _provided_ , however, that prior to taking such action, (i) the Board of Directors shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the Intervening Event, (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter and (iii) the Board of Directors shall have taken into account any changes to the financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by the Company and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, that failure to effect a Change in Company Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (whether or not applicable) or from otherwise making any disclosure to its stockholders that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that any communications to stockholders under such rules other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (whether or not applicable), an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation in favor of the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change of Company Recommendation. 

  

 (i) For purposes of this Section 5.5, "Board" or "Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of the Company or a special committee of the Board of Directors appointed by the Board of Directors to evaluate any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Section 5.6. _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance._  

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the respective articles of organization, certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless current and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any Person prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as a director or officer (or similar fiduciary agent of another corporation, partnership, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise), as provided in 

   ##### 

  

    

the respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect,
in connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges
paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines,
penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii)
promptly pay on behalf of each of the Indemnified Persons, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to, or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final
disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to
the Indemnified Person of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security, but subject to Parents or the Surviving Corporations, as
applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person, if required or permitted by applicable Law, to repay such Expenses if
it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this Section 5.6(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before
the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to
any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken
in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto). All rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or the
Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such
persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. For
purposes of this Section 5.6(a): (x) the term "Claim" means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, proceeding, investigation
or inquiry, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Entity
or any other party, that any Indemnified Person in good faith reasonably
believes might lead to the institution of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to
matters that relate to such Indemnified Persons duties or service as a
director or officer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, at or prior to
the Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries;
and (y) the term "Expenses" means reasonable attorneys fees and all other
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including,
without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in at the request of Parent or Surviving Corporation (including on appeal),
or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in at the
request of Parent or Surviving Corporation, any Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 5.6(a), including any
action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Person. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim in
respect of which indemnification has been sought by such Indemnified Person
hereunder unless: (i) such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release 

   ##### 

  

    

of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim, (ii)
such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto, or (iii) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation acknowledges that such Claim is subject to this Section
5.6. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for a term of six (6) years after the Effective Time, without any lapse in coverage, one or more so called "tail" or "run-off" directors and officers liability insurance policies with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed by the Indemnified Persons at or prior to the Effective Time (including, but not limited to, any acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) ("DandO Insurance"). Such DandO Insurance shall have a maximum premium of 300% of last years annual premium for the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (the "Premium Limit"), an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy at least as great as the aggregate annual coverage limit under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy, with a term of at least six (6) years and shall also be as near as possible in all other material respects to such existing policy; provided, however, that if the premium for six (6) years of DandO Insurance on such terms will exceed the Premium Limit, the Company may modify the term or coverage amounts so long as the premium does not exceed the Premium Limit. 

  

 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to possess sufficient assets in order for the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.6, provided, however, that to the extent the Surviving Corporation is unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder, Parent shall assume all such obligations. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives; provided, however, that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this Section 5.6 are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims. If Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, (A) to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 5.6 and (B) prompt notice thereof shall be provided to the Indemnified Persons. 

  

 (d) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Date, the articles of organization and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who were directors and officers prior to the Effective Time than are presently set forth in the Companys restated articles of organization, as amended, and bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 Section 5.7. _Public Announcements_. Subject to the Companys rights under Section 5.5(a), neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless Parent or the Company (as the case may be) determines that the issuance of such press release or the making of such other public statement is required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any applicable listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

  

 Section 5.8. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business combination" or similar Law is or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, then each of Parent, Merger Sub the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall, to the extent within their power or control, grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or similar Law on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 5.9. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt written notice to the Company, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt written notice to Parent, of: (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which such party is aware and that would be reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 not to be satisfied or result in such satisfaction being materially delayed or (b) any material failure of such party or of any officer, director, employee or Representative thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party giving or receiving such notice; and _provided_ further, that no party shall have the right not to close the Merger or the right to terminate this Agreement as a result of the failure of delivery of such a notice by another party hereto if the underlying breach would not result in such party having such rights under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 hereof. 

  

 Section 5.10. _Confidentiality_. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and confirms that (a) the Company, Sponsor and Parent have entered into a Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 19, 2010 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), (b) all information provided by a party hereto to another party hereto pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (c) the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions. 

  

 Section 5.11. _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of one year immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide each 

   ##### 

  

    

employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains employed with the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any other Affiliate of Parent (the
"Continuing Employees") as of the Effective Time, during such continued
employment (if any), with at least the same level of base salary, cash
incentive compensation and other cash variable compensation (on an aggregate,
not component-by-component, basis) that was provided to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the
Continuing Employees with employee benefits (other than equity-
based compensation) that are no less favorable, determined in the aggregate
on a Plan-by-Plan basis, than those provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided, that Parents obligations
under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) shall be limited to compensation
and employee benefits disclosed to Parent and its Representatives by the
Company not later than the date of this Agreement). The Company, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that this Section 5.11 is not intended to, and does not,
alter the at-will nature of the employment of any Continuing Employee, to the
extent that the employment of such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective
Time is at-will in nature. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its successors and assigns, shall guarantee the payment and performance of the Surviving Corporation with respect to, and cause the Surviving Corporation, and any successors or assigns, to assume, honor, perform and pay, in accordance with their terms, all supplemental employee retirement plans and other deferred compensation plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall not and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to impair, encumber, borrow against or otherwise take any actions adverse to the beneficiaries of the Companys supplemental employee retirement plans and other deferred compensation plans, including such life insurance policies that are maintained solely to satisfy identified obligations under such plans, other than borrowings against the policies that are used solely to make payments to the beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the plans as and when required thereunder. Parent, and its successors and assigns, shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any and all of its successors and assigns to expressly assume the Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans described in Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "SERPs"). Parent shall establish a Rabbi Trust prior to the Effective Date, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, to separately hold each and every underlying insurance contract maintained solely to satisfy identified obligations under any SERP. In no event shall Parent (or any of its successors, assigns or Affiliates) allow any Lien or other security interest of any nature or kind to attach to any of the life insurance policies that are maintained solely to satisfy identified obligations under the SERPs (except as may arise under applicable Law). 

  

 (c) Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and eligibility to receive benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (including vacation plans, programs and arrangements) established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries under which each Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time for service with the Company and any ERISA Affiliate through the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company and any ERISA Affiliate under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such employee benefit plan, program 

   ##### 

  

    

or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service accrued or deemed
accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company and any
ERISA Affiliate; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. 

  

 (d) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation ("Parent Welfare Benefit Plans") in which a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, subject to applicable Law, (a) use reasonable efforts to waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee under any Parent Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (b) provide credit to each Continuing Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee under the Company Benefit Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.11, whether express or implied, shall confer upon any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.11. No provision of this Section 5.11 is intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 

  

 Section 5.12. _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) using their reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter that are within their control and (iii) subject to the conditions set forth therein to consummate the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth therein. 

  

 (b) The Company shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in its efforts to obtain debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its officers, Subsidiaries and other Representatives to (i) when requested by Parent, participate on a timely basis in a reasonable number of meetings during normal business hours with potential providers of debt financing to Parent, a reasonable number of due diligence sessions during normal business hours and a reasonable number of sessions with rating agencies during normal business hours and provide direct contact between executives of the Company and the Companys other Representatives and potential providers of the debt financing to Parent during normal business hours, (ii) furnish Parent and potential providers of debt financing to Parent with unaudited 

   ##### 

  

    

monthly financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries when
requested in writing when available, (iii) assist Parent with the preparation
of bank information memoranda, lender presentations, rating agency
presentations and similar documents and materials as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such consents and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the debt financing, including customary payoff letters, Lien
releases, and landlord consents and access agreements, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral, including
cooperating in obtaining appraisals, financial analyses, surveys,
environmental assessments, third party consents and estoppels, mortgage
financeability and title insurance; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be required to pay any costs of any appraisals, surveys or environmental
assessments or any commitment or similar fee in connection with such
financing prior to the Effective Time; and _provided_ _further_ that
the Companys failure to obtain any of the foregoing, after using
commercially reasonable efforts to do so, shall not constitute a breach of
this Section 5.12(b) nor a failure to satisfy the conditions to closing set
forth in Section 6.2(b). The Company hereby consents to the use of its logo
in connection with the potential debt financing described in this Section
5.12, provided that its logo is used solely in a manner that is not intended
to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries,
or the reputation and good will of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent
and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of any debt
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is not a condition to the Closing. All non-public information provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their Representatives in accordance
with this Section 5.12 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, Parent agrees to promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days), upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in complying with this Section 5.12, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or arrangement of any such debt financing and any information used in connection herewith, except with respect to any information prepared or provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 Section 5.13. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt (and in any event within 24 hours) notice of, and copies of any documents filed or served in, any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall give Parent and its Representatives the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 (f) By the Company (unless the Company is then in material breach of its obligations, covenants or agreements, or its representations and warranties under this Agreement, that would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) not being satisfied), if all of the following shall have occurred: (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, (ii) such breach or failure to perform would entitle the Company not to consummate the Merger under Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) and (iii) such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Termination Date or, if such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Termination Date, Parent or Merger Sub shall not have cured such breach or failure

 (h) By the Company, prior to receipt of the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote, in order to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal pursuant to, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Section 5.5(f); _provided_ however, that such termination under this Section 7.1(h) shall not be effective until the Company has paid the Termination Fee as required by Section 7.2(c). 

 

Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
through 7.1(h) shall give written notice of such termination to the other
parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is

 Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other Representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of Section 5.2(b) (last sentence only), Section 5.7, Section 5.10, Section 5.12(c), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.4 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) subject to Section 7.2(b), Section 7.2(c), Section 7.2(d), Section 8.6 and Section 8.15, neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub shall be relieved or released from any liabilities arising out of its material breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement to the extent such breach or fraud was a proximate cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated prior to the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that a party may not seek punitive or multiple damages against another party. For the avoidance of doubt, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) If (i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e), in either case, under circumstances in which the Termination Fee (as defined in Section 7.2(c)) is not then 

   ##### 

  

    

payable pursuant to Section 7.2(c), then the Company shall pay as promptly as
possible (but in any event within five (5) Business Days following receipt of
a reasonably detailed invoice therefor) all of the actual and reasonably
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable and
documented legal fees and expenses and fees and expenses of accountants,
financial advisors, consultants, lenders and other agents and advisors)
actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to
such termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and the related financing transactions ("Parent
Expenses") as directed by Parent in writing, which amount shall not be
greater than $2,000,000; _provided_ , that (A) the existence of circumstances
which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.2(c) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.2(b); (B)
the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
7.2(b) shall not relieve (except as provided in clause (C) of this proviso)
the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 7.2(c); and (C) if the Company has paid the Parent Expenses under
this Section 7.2(b) and is subsequently required to pay the Termination Fee
under Section 7.2(c), the Termination Fee payable under Section 7.2(c) shall
be reduced by the full amount of Parent Expenses previously paid by the
Company under this Section 7.2(b). 

  

 (c) If (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) or (iii) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and, in the case of any such termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(d) or 7.1(e), (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise publicly communicated to the senior management, Board of Directors or stockholders of the Company and (B) prior to the date that is twelve months after the effective date of such termination, the Company shall enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case regardless of whether the Acquisition Proposal is the same one referred to in clause (A)), then, subject to clause (C) of the proviso contained in Section 7.2(b), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee equal to $4,150,000 (the "Termination Fee"),  _provided_ , however, that "Termination Fee" shall mean $3,150,000 if the Acquisition Proposal that directly results in the action or event that forms the basis for such termination is submitted by a Continuing Party or any Affiliate of a Continuing Party. The Company shall satisfy its obligation under the preceding sentence by the wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account that Parent designates (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to clause (i) above, not later than 2 Business Days following such termination, (y) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii) above, not later than the date of such termination and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, not later than the date on which the Company executes and delivers a definitive agreement with respect to (or, if earlier, consummates) an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of clause (B) of item (iii) of this Section 7.2(c) only, references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more." In no event shall payment of more than one Termination Fee be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to Sections 7.2(b), 7.2(d) and 8.6(g), from and after the time that this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 and Parent becomes entitled to receive and has received such Termination Fee, Parents receipt of the Termination Fee pursuant to this 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 7.2(c) shall be Parents sole and exclusive remedy against the Company
or any of its Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents or Representatives for any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated in circumstances giving rise to the
obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee under this Section
7.2(c). 

  

 (d) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amounts payable under Section 7.2(b) or 7.2(c) then the Company shall pay to Parent all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the collection of such overdue amounts and the enforcement of its rights under Section 7.2(b) or 7.2(c), as applicable, together with interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the " _prime rate_ " (as announced by the Wall Street Journal or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made. 

  

 Section 7.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by Parent and the Company, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained; _provided_ , however, that after the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, this Agreement may not be amended in a manner that would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, without obtaining such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written instrument signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 7.4. _Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, any party hereto may, subject to applicable Law, by action taken or authorized by its board of directors, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto under or pursuant to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made by the other parties hereto in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or covenants hereunder made by the other parties hereto, or any of the conditions benefiting such waiving party contained, in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only as against such party and only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. In addition, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no such extension or waiver shall apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or non-compliance with any agreement, covenant or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the signed written extension or waiver.

 Section 8.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior understandings, agreements or representations, by or among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 Section 8.5. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. No party hereto may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written approval of the other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment without such prior written approval shall be void and without legal effect; _provided_ , however, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign its rights or its obligations hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 Section 8.6. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance; Remedies; Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ANY CLAIM DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF INSOFAR AS SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION TO APPLY, EXCEPT THAT MATTERS RELATING TO THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE BOARD AND INTERNAL CORPORATE AFFAIRS OF THE COMPANY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF INSOFAR AS SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION TO APPLY. 

  

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY. 

  

 (c) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that money damages or any other remedy at law would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy for any breach or violation of, or default under, this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter by them and that, in addition to all other remedies available pursuant to this Agreement, each party shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to seek an injunction or injunctions restraining such actual or threatened breach, violation or default and to any other equitable relief, including specific performance and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Laws and this right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to seek to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Sponsor to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and applicable Laws and to thereafter cause the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding Section 8.6(c) above, the Company hereby covenants and agrees that specific performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letter by Sponsor shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedies (but for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may, subject to this Section 8.6(d) and Section 8.6(e) below and Section 8(d) and Section 8(e) of the Equity Commitment Letter, plead and seek monetary damages solely as alternative relief if specific performance were to be denied) under or in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and, except as provided in Section 8.6(e) below and in Section 8(e) of the Equity Commitment Letter, that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that might otherwise be available under or in connection with this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including monetary damages). 

  

 (e) If a court of competent jurisdiction described in Section 8.6(f) below has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the obligations of Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought by the Company against Parent, Merger Sub and Sponsor under Section 8.6(d) above and Section 8(d) of the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company shall, as an alternative remedy, be entitled to seek monetary damages. If such court has under such circumstance entered a judgment awarding damages against Parent or Merger Sub, the Company may enforce such judgment as its sole remedy; _provided_ , that the Company covenants and agrees that it will not seek to enforce such judgment without giving effect to Section 8.15 and until ten (10) Business Days after such judgment is no longer subject to appeal or other review, and then only if Parent and Merger Sub have not within such ten (10) Business Day period irrevocably committed in writing to the Company to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and Sponsor has not within such ten (10) Business Day period irrevocably committed in writing to the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, as promptly as practicable. Should Parent, Merger Sub and the Sponsor express such irrevocable commitments, the parties hereto will cooperate with one another to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the giving of such irrevocable commitments. If the Merger is not consummated within such fifteen (15) Business Day period as the result of the failure of Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsor to comply with such irrevocable commitments, the Company shall be entitled to enforce such judgment. The Company agrees to cause any pending proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter are intended to and shall allow the Company only a single recovery against Parent, Merger Sub and the Sponsor, which recovery under no circumstances shall exceed, in the aggregate, the Parent Liability Limitation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be exclusively brought, heard and decided in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or (i) if, but only if, the Delaware Court of Chancery has declined to accept jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or (ii) if, but only if, the Chancery Court and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware each declined to accept jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or (iii) if, but only if, such Chancery Court, and each such United States District Court have declined to accept jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, the Business Litigation Session of the Massachusetts Superior Court located in Boston, Massachusetts), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum; _provided_ , that any party may institute a suit, action or proceeding in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an Order of one of the above-named courts, and _further provided_ , that in the event that, and for so long as, the Delaware Court of Chancery does not decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular suit, action or proceeding, the parties hereto waive any right that they may have to remove such suit, action or proceeding to a federal court, under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441 or otherwise. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court, consistent with applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party by personal delivery or by overnight courier as provided in Section 8.3 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties further agree that each will jointly request or consent to a motion brought by another party that any such suit, action or proceeding brought pursuant to Section 8.6(d) hereof (or appeal therefrom) be heard and decided in an expedited manner as may be permitted by the rules of the court in which such suit, action or proceeding is pending. 

  

 (g) If any party commences any suit, action or proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, in addition to any amounts that may be owed pursuant to this Agreement, the prevailing party (as determined by the court) shall recover its costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and experts. 

  

 Section 8.7. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, then all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as 

   ##### 

  

    

possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

 

 Section 8.8. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) (A) the rights of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to and in accordance with Article 2, (B) the rights of the holders of the Company Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, and participants in the Company ESPP to receive the amounts described in Section 1.9 and (C) the rights of the Indemnified Persons under Section 5.6 and (ii) the rights of the Parent Parties under Section 8.15, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties, agreements and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries described in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 8.8 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.4 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, Persons (other than the parties hereto) may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

   

 Section 8.9. _Disclosure Schedule_. 

  

 (a) The disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") and the disclosure schedules delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") shall be arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered Sections and lettered subsections of this Agreement, and the exceptions and disclosures in each such section and subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall apply to the correspondingly numbered Section and lettered subsection of this Agreement and to each other numbered Section(s) or lettered subsection(s) of the Agreement to the extent it is readily apparent on the face of each disclosure that such disclosure is responsive to such other Section(s) or subsection(s). 

  

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule accompanying this Agreement will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in such schedules, that such information is required to be listed in such schedules or that such information is material to any party or the conduct of the business of any party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.10. _Counterparts_.
