Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, MergerCo shall be merged with and into the Company and
the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall cease. After the Merger,
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall have the effect as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all

MergerCo shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all restrictions,
obligations, duties, debts and liabilities of the Company and MergerCo shall

## 

  

## 1.2 _Merger Consideration_. The consideration to be paid by Parent and
MergerCo in respect of the Merger shall be equal to the sum of (i)
$114,300,000 in cash (the " _Cash Merger Consideration_ ") and (ii)
2,608,696 shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Merger Consideration_
"), which shall be payable as provided in Sections 1.3(c) and 1.3(d).

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

## 1.3 _Closing; Effective Time._

  

## 

  

### (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at, or
be directed from, the offices of Hunton and Williams LLP, Bank of America
Plaza, Suite 4100, 600 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30308, at
10:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than
conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the waiver or satisfaction of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as the parties may agree. The " _Closing Date_ " shall
be the date upon which the Closing occurs.

  

### 

  

### (b) On the Closing Date, MergerCo and the Company will cause the
appropriate certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
" _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in such form and executed as provided in
Section 251(c) of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at the time
when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State, or such later time as may be specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Parent shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available funds a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration equal to the
amount necessary to pay (based on the amounts set forth in a certificate
delivered by the Company as provided in Section 1.3(e)) (i) all outstanding
principal, interest and all other amounts due and payable at the Effective
Time under, and to satisfy and discharge the obligations of the Company or
New Edge Network, Inc. in respect of, the Credit Agreement and the
Subordinated Loan Agreements (provided that such amount payable pursuant to
this Section 1.3(c)(i) may be reduced by an amount equal to the cash and cash
equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing, which cash and cash equivalents may be used by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to repay its obligations with respect to the Investor
Subordinated Loan Agreement or any Excess Debt) and (ii) the Company
Transaction Expenses and, in each case, the Company promptly will take such
steps as may be necessary to cause the satisfaction and discharge of all such
obligations thereunder. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the
Escrow Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) at any time prior to the
Closing Date, each holder of Common Stock and each holder of Vested Company
Options may elect, by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent with a
copy of such notice to Parent, to be entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions payable in respect of such holders proportionate share
of the Escrow Shares, and to have the Representative, on behalf of such
holder of Common Stock or Vested Company Options, vote such holders
proportionate share of the Escrow Shares; _further_ _provided_ , _however_ ,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of Common Stock or Vested
Company Options who so elects shall be deemed to receive from Parent, at the
Closing, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to such
holders proportionate share of the Escrow Shares, and such holder of Common
Stock or Vested Company Options shall be deemed to deposit with the Escrow
Agent such shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Parent shall (i) deliver to the Paying Agent that number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of the Stock Merger Consideration
less the Escrow Shares and (ii) pay to the Paying Agent an amount in cash
equal to the excess of (x) the Cash Merger Consideration over (y) the sum of
(A) the amount in cash paid to the Company pursuant to Sections 1.3(c)(i) and
(c)(ii), (B) the Tax Liability Reserve and (C) any Excess Debt (to the extent
not repaid with cash or cash

equivalents of the Company or its Subsidiaries), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, which shall be used (based on the
certificate delivered by the Company as provided in Section 1.3(e)) as
set forth in this Section 1.3(d).  Immediately after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to each holder of Common Stock who has delivered
to the Paying Agent a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and surrendered the
applicable Certificate or Certificates (i) an aggregate amount in cash (by
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the discretion of
the Paying Agent) equal to the product of the number of shares represented by
such Certificate or Certificates and the Per Share Cash Consideration,
without interest thereon, and (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares represented by such Certificate or
Certificates and the Per Share Stock Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ ,
no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued, but in lieu
thereof each holder of Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive
from the Paying Agent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest $0.01) equal
to the product of (x) such fraction multiplied by (y) the Parent Common Stock
Closing Price, without interest thereon. Parent will make available to the
Paying Agent any cash necessary for this purpose.

  

### 

  

### (e) In order to facilitate the payments contemplated by Sections 1.3(c)
and 1.3(d), the Company will deliver to Parent and to MergerCo not less than
three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date a statement,
certified by the chief financial officer of the Company, that will set forth:
(1) the aggregate amount payable to each lender under the Credit Agreement
and the Subordinated Loan Agreements pursuant to Section 1.3(c)(i), (2) the
aggregate amount of any Excess Debt, (3) the Company Transaction Expenses and
(4) the calculation of the Fully-Diluted Number. Parent shall be entitled to
rely without investigation on the information set forth in such certificate
in delivering the Cash Merger Consideration and the Stock Merger
Consideration to the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Parent shall not be obligated to deliver any portion of
the Cash Merger Consideration or the Stock Merger Consideration to the Paying
Agent unless and until the Company has delivered the certificate contemplated
by this Section 1.3(e) to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at and in
connection with the Closing:

  

### 

  

##### (i) each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates that
prior thereto represented shares of Common Stock will, in accordance with the
procedures described in Section 1.10(c) and the applicable Letter
of Transmittal, deliver to the Paying Agent, in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration, such Certificate or Certificates, duly endorsed in
blank or accompanied by stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly
executed in blank, and bearing or accompanied by all requisite stock transfer
stamps, together with the wire transfer or other payment instructions with

Company Options who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of

issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted to adopt this Agreement and who
properly demands appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as described in
Section 1.4, but shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, unless such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to
appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder fails to
perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Stockholders shares of Common Stock shall no longer be considered Dissenting
Shares for the purposes of this Agreement and such holders shares of Common
Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective
Time, as described in Section 1.4, and such holder shall not be entitled to
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 1.9, if the Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
then the right of any Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair market value
of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall
cease.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent and MergerCo ( _i_ ) prompt notice of

negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands, and the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

under Section 262 of the DGCL, ( _iii_ ) a letter of transmittal specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss of the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as the
Company may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and ( _iv_

pursuant to Section 7.1 or otherwise, the

Paying Agent shall return the Certificates in its possession to the holder of
record. At or after the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate to
the Paying Agent together with the applicable transmittal documents, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Share Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares represented by
such Certificate as provided in Section 1.3(d), without any
interest thereon. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made with respect to such shares to such a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer

### 

  

### (d) _Dividends on Parent Common Stock_. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement.  No dividends or other distributions pertaining
to Parent Common Stock with a record date on the same date as or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any holders of shares of Common Stock who
have not surrendered their Certificates for exchange, until the holders of
such Certificates shall have exchanged such Certificates in accordance with
Section 1.4 hereof.  Subject to the effect, if any, of applicable law, the
Paying Agent shall receive, hold, and remit any such dividends or other
distributions to each such record holder entitled thereto, without interest,
at the time that such Certificates are surrendered to the Paying Agent for
exchange. Holders of Common Stock will not be entitled, however, to dividends
or other distributions that are payable to persons who were holders of record
of Parent Common Stock as of a record date that is prior to the date of the
Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Satisfaction_. All Per Share Merger Consideration issued upon
surrender of the Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including
any cash paid for fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock
represented by the Certificates.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Share Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the share transfer books of the Company of any shares of
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates of the Company are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and the shares of Common
Stock represented thereby shall be converted as provided in Section 1.4.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Unclaimed Consideration_. Six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver any portion of
the Per Share Merger Consideration that it holds and that remains unclaimed
to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time who has not theretofore complied with this Section
1.10 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of any portion
of the Per Share Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of
any Certificates such holder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
as a general creditor and without any interest thereon. Any Per Share Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Common Stock as of
the date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest or any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and their Affiliates, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be
liable for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Company or the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation shall direct the
Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 1.11 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Stock Merger Consideration, Cash
Merger Consideration or Escrow Merger Consideration, as applicable, otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Companys
capital stock, such amounts that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of the Companys capital stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent.

  

## 

  

## 1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_.  Each of the parties
hereto will take, or cause to be taken, all such reasonable and lawful action
as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or appropriate
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and MergerCo, the
officers and directors of the Company and MergerCo immediately prior to the
Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take or cause to be taken, all
such reasonable and lawful action.

entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in so relying, upon any
instrument or document executed, or notice, communication decision or action
made by the Representative.

fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in defense or settlement or otherwise in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any facts or
events existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date for a period of
six years after the Closing Date; _provided_  that if any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of
any and all such claims. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses to an Indemnified Party, as
incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; _provided_
that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final non appealable order or decree that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Closing Date), ( _i_ ) the DandO Indemnified Parties shall
promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation thereof, ( _ii_ )
any counsel retained by the DandO Indemnified Parties for any period after

required to effectively defend against such action or proceedings, and ( _iv_
) none of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). None of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if it shall
be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable
order or decree that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

### (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be purchased, or
at its election allow the Company and its Subsidiaries to purchase, a "tail"
or extended reporting period endorsement directors and officers liability
insurance policy in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(covering a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time and of at least
the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are,
in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured than the Companys and
its Subsidiaries existing directors and officers liability insurance
policy), with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time for those persons who are
currently covered by such policy; provided, however, that the aggregate
premium for insurance under this Section 4.8 shall not be in excess of
$85,000 net of any refund or credit for the remaining term of the existing
policy and if such premium for such insurance exceeds that amount, then
Parent shall cause to be purchased insurance policies that provide the

parties hereto hereby agrees that the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements made in this

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

## Agreement or in any document or instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the Closing Date and continue in effect until the fifteen (15)-month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

## 

  

## 6.2 _Indemnification_. Parent, MergerCo and the Surviving Corporation (the
" _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to indemnification from
the Escrow Account from and against all Losses incurred or suffered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties arising out of, relating to, or resulting from (i)
any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement or any Company Closing Document,  _provided_ that
to the extent that any such representation and warranty is qualified by
materiality or by whether there is or could result in a Material Adverse
Effect, such qualification shall be ignored for purposes of indemnification
under this Section 6.2, (ii) the breach of, or the failure to perform, any
covenant or agreement of the Company made in this Agreement or any Company
Closing Document, and (iii) any Tax Liability to the extent that such Tax
Liability exceeds the Tax Liability Reserve. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not have any rights to indemnity for any
Losses pursuant to this Section 6.2 until the aggregate of all Losses
eligible for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.2 equals or exceeds
$500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at which time the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses, subject to a maximum

Date, absent fraud or willful misconduct, the right to indemnification of the
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VI from the Escrow
Account shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified
Parties for any and all claims for (i) Losses with respect to the Company,
this Agreement, the Merger and all representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein and (ii) the Tax Liabilities, and the Parent
Indemnified Parties unconditionally and irrevocably waive any other remedy
which they, or any other Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, may

directors, employees and officers of the Company and its affiliates, from and
against any liabilities or claims of any nature whatsoever with respect to
all such matters and with respect to all other matters relating to periods
prior to the Closing Date, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not seek
indemnification or contribution from any of the foregoing with respect
thereto. The amount of any indemnifiable Losses under this Article VI shall
be calculated after giving effect to any tax benefit (through an actual
reduction of Taxes or refund of Taxes paid) resulting from the applicable
indemnification claim.

  

## 

  

## 6.3 _Third Party Claims._

claim against the Escrow Account or the Representative desires to make a
claim against Parent, in each case in connection with any third party
litigation, arbitration, action suit, proceeding, claim, investigation or
demand at any time instituted against or made upon it for which it may seek
indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnification Control Person of such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification with respect
thereto after obtaining notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, that
failure to promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations under this Article VI, except (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced
thereby.

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

### (b) The Indemnification Control Person will have the right to assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by written notice to the Indemnified
Party within twenty (20) days after the Indemnification Control Person has
received notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to permit such an assumption of the
defense of any Third Party Claim that, if not first paid, discharged or
otherwise complied with, would result in a material interruption or
disruption of the business of the Indemnified Party, or any material part
thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Indemnification Control Person assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnification Control Person shall take all steps
necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim, except
where, and only to the extent that, the Indemnification Control Person has

binding upon the parties hereto. Any shares of Parent Common Stock remaining
in the Escrow Account after the resolution of all outstanding claims will be
paid to the Paying Agent for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and
Vested Company Options in the proportion that the Closing Stock Consideration
was distributed at Closing.

partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege.

in any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein
contained invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.
Any provision of this Agreement held invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable
only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not
held invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable.
