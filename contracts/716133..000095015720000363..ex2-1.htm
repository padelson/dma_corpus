      or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (A) all conditions in Sections 7.01 and 7.03 were satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) at
      the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in
      accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required
      of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.&#160; <font style="color: #000000;">The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law, and not to assert that a remedy of
