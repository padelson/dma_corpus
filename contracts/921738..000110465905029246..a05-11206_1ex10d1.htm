 (this "Agreement")**

  



  

 **Dated: June 20, 2005**

  



  

 **1.** ** _Agreement to Execute_**

  



  

(a) _Execution of Securities Purchase Agreement_. Each of CP Baton Rouge
Casino, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company (" **Buyer** "),
and Columbia Sussex Corporation, a Kentucky corporation and the indirect
parent company of Buyer (" **Parent Guarantor** "), hereby agrees to execute
and deliver, and Penn National Gaming, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("
**Penn** "), hereby agrees to cause Argosy Gaming Company, a Delaware
corporation and, immediately following the Effective Time (as defined below),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn (" **Seller** "), to execute and deliver,
in each case, immediately following the Effective Time, (a) a definitive
Securities Purchase Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Annex A_ (the " **Securities**   **Purchase Agreement** "), and (b)
a definitive Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form attached
as _Exhibit D_ to the Securities Purchase Agreement, in each case, subject
to (i) Buyers receipt of an updated Seller Disclosure Letter at least five
days prior to the Effective Date, (ii) Buyers right to disapprove, prior to
the Effective Date, any change or changes made in such updated Seller
Disclosure Letter from the Seller Disclosure Letter attached as _Annex B_
hereto, which change or changes would have, or which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an ACBR Material Adverse
Effect, (iii) since the date hereof, there shall have been no ACBR Material
Adverse Effect, and (iv) **Paragraph 1(b) **below.

  



  

As used herein, " **Effective Time** " means the effective time of the merger
of Thoroughbred Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Penn (" **Merger Sub** "), with and into Seller (such
time, the " **Effective Time** " and, the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, the " **Effective Date** "), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of November 3, 2004 (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " **Merger Agreement** "), by and among Penn, Merger Sub and Seller.

  



  

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Survey_. Seller shall cause to be delivered to Buyer, promptly after it
is received by Seller, the ALTA/ACSM survey of the Property that is currently
being undertaken by SJB Group, Inc. (the " **Survey** "). For a period of
five (5) business days after Buyers receipt of the Survey, Buyer shall have
the right to deliver notice to Seller objecting to any matters disclosed in
the Survey which would materially and adversely affect the use of the
Property as it is currently being used and which are not Permitted
Encumbrances (disregarding solely for this purpose the reference to the
"Survey" in clause (i) of the definition of Permitted Encumbrances) ("
**Objectionable Survey Matters** ").

  



  

If Buyer does not deliver such notice to Seller within such five (5) business
day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted all matters shown on the
Survey and the parties agree that the Survey shall be attached to the
Securities Purchase Agreement as _Exhibit G_ and shall constitute the
"Survey" as such term is defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement. If
Buyer delivers such notice to Seller within such five (5) business day
period, Seller shall as promptly as reasonably practicable commence using
commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate such Objectionable Survey
Matters or to have the title company insure against such Objectionable Survey
Matters.

  

   

     
   

  



  

If, using commercially reasonable efforts, Seller is unable to eliminate such
Objectionable Survey Matters, or to have the title company insure against
such Objectionable Survey Matters, in each case, prior to the Effective Date,
then: (i) Seller may at its option elect to continue using commercially
reasonable efforts to eliminate such Objectionable Survey Matters, or to have
the title company insure against such Objectionable Survey Matters, for so
long as Seller deems that such efforts may reasonably be expected to result
in the elimination of the Objectionable Survey Matters or the title company
insuring over such Objectionable Survey Matters prior to Closing, in which
case the parties agree to modify the Securities Purchase Agreement
accordingly and to execute such modified Securities Purchase Agreement on the
Effective Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter; and (ii) Buyer and
Seller shall in good faith use their respective reasonable best efforts to
reach a mutually agreeable resolution of any remaining Objectionable Survey
Matters not addressed by the preceding clause (i) prior to execution of the
Securities Purchase Agreement, shall modify the Securities Purchase Agreement
accordingly to reflect any such resolution and shall execute such modified
Securities Purchase Agreement on the Effective Date or as promptly as
practicable after such resolution is reached. If Buyer and Seller, after
discussing such matters in good faith and using their reasonable best efforts
to reach resolution, are unable to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of
any remaining Objectionable Survey Matters not addressed by the preceding
clause (i), the parties shall have the right to mutually terminate this
Agreement.

forth in _Section 11.2_ of the Securities Purchase Agreement (or at such
other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice).

  



  

(c) _Headings; Table of Contents_. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreements and all documents and instruments referred to
herein constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

  



  

(e) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

(f) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law (including,
without limitation, by merger or consolidation) or otherwise without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of this
**Paragraph 10(f) **shall be void.

  



  

(g) _Parties of Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and/or in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

  



  

(i) _Mutual Drafting_. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of
this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties.  In the event of any ambiguity or question
of intent arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

(j) _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by Buyer, Parent Guarantor and
Penn. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Buyer, Parent Guarantor and Penn.

(k) _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer and Penn by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors may, to
the extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for or waive the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

  



  

(l) _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to this Agreement
and all terms, provisions, covenants and conditions herein.

  



  

(m) _Parent Guaranty_. Parent Guarantor hereby guarantees the punctual
payment and performance by Buyer of all of Buyers obligations under this
Agreement. Parent Guarantor hereby waives notice of the acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of protest, or any and all
notice of non-payment, non-performance or non-observance, or other proof, or
notice or demand with respect to the obligations guaranteed under this
**Paragraph 10(m)** (the " **Guaranteed Obligations** "). The
guarantee provided for in this **Paragraph 10(m)**  (this " **Guarantee** ")
shall remain and continue in full force and effect as to any modification,
extension or renewal of this Agreement. None of Penn or its Affiliates shall
be under a duty to protect, secure or insure any security or lien provided by
this Agreement or any other collateral, and Parent Guarantor acknowledges
that other indulgences or forbearance may be granted under such document, all
of which may be made, done or suffered without notice to, or further consent
of, Parent Guarantor.  Parent Guarantor hereby waives the pleading of any
statute of limitations applicable to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, as a
defense to the obligation hereunder.

  



  

PARENT GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY RIGHT OR CLAIM OF RIGHT TO CAUSE PENN TO PROCEED
AGAINST BUYER BEFORE PROCEEDING UNDER THIS GUARANTEE. PARENT GUARANTOR
EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES ALL SURETYSHIP RIGHTS AND REMEDIES
(INCLUDING ANY RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION) APPLICABLE AGAINST SELLER ACCORDED TO
PARENT GUARANTOR BY APPLICABLE LAW.

  



  

Parent Guarantor agrees that the validity of this Guarantee and Parent
Guarantors obligations under this Agreement shall in no way be terminated,
affected or impaired by reason of (i) the assertion by Penn of any rights or
remedies which Penn may have under or with respect to any of the other
provisions of this Agreement (ii) the failure by Penn to exercise, or delay
in exercising, any right or remedy which Penn may have hereunder or in
respect to this Agreement; (iii) the commencement of a case under the
Bankruptcy Code by or against Buyer; or (iv) any payment made on the
obligations guaranteed by this Guarantee or any other indebtedness arising
under this Agreement which is required to be refunded pursuant to the order
of any court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy or insolvency of Buyer;
it being understood that no payment so refunded shall be considered as a
payment of any portion of the obligations guaranteed hereby, nor shall it
have the effect of reducing the liability of Parent Guarantor under this
Agreement.

  



  

(n) _FTC Approval_. All terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Securities Purchase Agreement shall be subject to FTC approval and
the substitution or addition of such modified or other terms and conditions
as the FTC may require.

  



  

(i) Each party hereto agrees to accept such changes to this Agreement and the
Securities Purchase Agreement as shall be required by the FTC and to execute
promptly an appropriate amendment to this Agreement and to modify the
Securities Purchase Agreement to reflect such required changes (such
amendment and such modification, together, an

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

" **Amendment** "), unless (A) such changes would have, in the aggregate, an
ACBR Material Adverse Effect, in which case the parties hereto shall not be
required to execute an Amendment, or (B) if the FTC requests or requires any
change to this Agreement or the Securities Purchase Agreement that would
adversely affect the economics of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement, in which case the
party whose economics would be adversely affected (the " **Affected Party**
") may elect not to execute an Amendment, and, in the case of each of clauses
(A) and (B), the parties hereto shall take the actions set forth in **clause
(ii) **below.

  



  

(ii) If (x) the FTC requires any changes that would have, in the aggregate,
an ACBR Material Adverse Effect or (y) if the Affected Party elects not to
execute an Amendment pursuant to the preceding **clause (i)** , then the
parties hereto shall, in good faith, use their respective best efforts to
reach prompt (but in any event within seven days after receiving the
FTCs request to make the required changes) mutual agreement with respect to
such changes, including, without limitation, to adjust the Purchase Price to
offset the adverse economics to the extent the Affected Party recognizes an
equivalent benefit through such change. If the parties hereto, after
complying with the preceding sentence, are unable to reach mutual agreement
with respect to such changes within such seven day period, then (A) in the
case of the preceding clause (x), either party may elect to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to **Paragraph 8(a)(i)(y)** , and (B) in the case of the
preceding clause (y), the parties shall submit the matters that the parties
have been unable to resolve with respect to such changes to an independent
nationally recognized investment banking firm, independent nationally
recognized accounting firm or other independent arbitrator (" **Arbitrator**
") mutually agreed upon by Penn and Buyer for final and binding resolution of
such dispute in accordance with procedures mutually agreed upon by Penn
and Buyer. If Buyer and Penn are unable to agree on an Arbitrator, then
Buyer and Penn shall each select such an Arbitrator and the two Arbitrators
so selected shall select a third Arbitrator. The findings of the Arbitrator
so selected by Buyer and Penn (or, if Buyer and Penn are unable to agree on
an Arbitrator, so selected by the Arbitrators pursuant to the foregoing
sentence) shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto, and the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator(s) shall be paid by one-half by Penn and
one-half by Buyer.
