Buyer, of any asset, contract, lease, license, right or property that would be a GMS Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any Law or
would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and
such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the
Closing, the Closing shall proceed and Buyer shall pay the full Purchase Price at Closing without
the sale, assignment, lease, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset (and the
failure to obtain such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the failure to sell, assign,
convey or deliver such
assets shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller), and this Agreement shall
not constitute a sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset or an
attempt thereof. In the event that the Closing proceeds without the transfer, sublease or
assignment of any such asset, then following the Closing, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers; provided, however, that neither Seller nor any of the Selling Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any consideration or compromise any rights not otherwise required by this
Agreement to be compromised for any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, other than
filing, recordation or similar fees, which shall be reimbursed by Buyer. Pending such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in any
mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of
use of such asset and to the Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, as applicable, the benefits,
including any indemnities, that it would have obtained had the asset been conveyed to Buyer at the
Closing. To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.10</U>

pay to Seller an amount equal to the Carrier Reimbursement with respect to claims asserted by the
