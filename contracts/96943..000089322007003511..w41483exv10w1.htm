Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer is not assuming (directly or indirectly, by entity acquisition or an acquisition of shares) any, and Seller shall remain responsible for and Seller or the relevant Selling Subsidiary shall retain all, debts, liabilities and obligations (whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether arising out of occurrences, events or incidents occurring before, on or after the Effective Time and whether primary or secondary, direct or indirect, known or unknown, fixed or contingent) of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and the Acquired Companies (the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "), to the extent such debts, liabilities or obligations arise out of the following:

 Section 2.5 _Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, Buyer shall (i) pay to Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries the aggregate purchase price of Five Hundred Sixty Million U.S. dollars ($560,000,000.00) in cash less the amount required to repay the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies outstanding at the Effective Time (together, the " _Purchase Price_ "), and (ii) assume the Assumed Liabilities. 

  

 (b) If a party determines that it may be required by Law to withhold on account of Taxes with respect to a payment to be made hereunder to any Governmental Authority, such party shall provide the other party prompt written notice thereof (but, with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price, in no event less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) and shall be permitted to so withhold and, provided that the amount so withheld is remitted to the Governmental Authority to whom such withheld amounts should be remitted, such withheld amount shall be treated as having been paid to such party. In the event, Buyer has a withholding obligation under Law in connection with the Adjustment Payment and Buyers obligation exceeds the amount which it is required to pay under Section 2.6 with respect to the Adjustment Payment, Buyer shall notify Seller of the amount of such excess and Seller shall be required, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such notice, to pay to Buyer the amount of such excess, which amount Buyer shall be required to remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority as amounts withheld from a payment to Seller. 

  

 Section 2.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a working capital statement setting forth the Net Working Capital of the Business as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), which shall be derived from a balance sheet of the Business as of the Effective Time, prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States consistently applied (" _GAAP_ "), except for the use of accounting practices, principles and methodologies reflected in Section 2.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be excluded from the Closing Working Capital Statement all Excluded Assets and all Excluded Liabilities. Seller shall provide Buyer and its accountants full access to the Books and Records, any other information, including the work papers of its accountants, and to any employees, to the extent necessary for Buyer to prepare the Closing Working Capital Statement. All parties agree that following the Closing and prior to the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital Statement, neither of them shall alter or destroy any of the Books and Records on which the Closing Working Capital Statement is to be based. 

  

 (b) Seller shall, within sixty (60) days after the delivery by Buyer of the Closing Working Capital Statement (" _Seller s Review Period_"), complete its review of Net 

   ##### 

  

 

Working Capital reflected on the Closing Working Capital Statement. Buyer
shall provide Seller and its accountants full access to its Books and
Records, any other information, including the work papers of its accountants,
and to any employees, to the extent necessary for Seller to review the Closing
Working Capital Statement and prepare the Sellers Objection, if any. The
Closing Working Capital Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and
deemed accepted by, Seller and Buyer unless Seller shall have notified Buyer
in writing prior to the expiration of Sellers Review Period of any good
faith objection thereto, which written objection can only be that Net Working
Capital, as reflected on the Closing Working Capital Statement, is
inaccurate, has not been prepared in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ or
contains mathematical errors on its face (the " _Seller s Objection_");
_provided_ , that Seller may not deliver more than one Sellers Objection and
may not amend its Sellers Objection once it has been delivered to Buyer.
The Sellers Objection shall set forth a specific description of the basis of
Sellers Objection and the specific adjustments to Net Working Capital
reflected on the Closing Working Capital Statement which Seller believes
should be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) any items not disputed in a
valid Sellers Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and
Buyer, (ii) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall within five (5)
Business Days of the date of the expiration of Sellers Review Period make
the Adjustment Payment required by _Section 2.6(e)_ with respect to such
undisputed items, and (iii) Seller and Buyer each agree that it shall not
object to or otherwise challenge the Working Capital Amount. 

   

 (c) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of their disputes with respect to the Closing Working Capital Statement within fifteen (15) days following Buyers receipt of Sellers Objection to such Closing Working Capital Statement pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, they shall refer their remaining differences to Ernst and Young (New York office) or another internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to which Buyer and Seller mutually agree (the " _CPA Firm_ ") for decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the parties upon delivery of the written opinion set forth in sub-clause (iii) below. The procedure and schedule under which any dispute shall be submitted to the CPA Firm shall be as follows: 

   

 (i) Within fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (c) above, Seller shall submit any unresolved portion of Sellers Objection to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to Buyer), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies. 

   

 (ii) Within fifteen (15) days following Sellers submission of the unresolved portion of Sellers Objection as specified in sub-clause (i) above, Buyer shall submit its response to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to Seller), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies. 

   

 (iii) The CPA Firm shall deliver its written opinion within twenty (20) days following its receipt of the information provided for in sub-clause (ii) above, or such longer period of time as the CPA Firm determines is necessary, but not to exceed thirty (30) days. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to the unresolved portion of the Sellers Objection. Seller and Buyer shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant Books and Records and any work papers (including those of the parties respective 

   ##### 

  

   

accountants) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement and all other
items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. 

  

 Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer so that Sellers share of such costs shall be in the same proportion that (x) the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted by Seller to the CPA Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed bears to (y) the total amount of all disputed items submitted by Seller to the CPA Firm; the remaining portion of such costs to be allocated to Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Closing Working Capital Statement. 

  

 (d) The Closing Working Capital Statement shall become final and binding on the parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Sellers Objection has been given, the expiration of the Sellers Review Period, (ii) agreement in writing by Buyer and Seller that the Closing Working Capital Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed by Buyer and Seller, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing Working Capital Statement. The Closing Working Capital Statement, as submitted by Buyer if no timely Sellers Objection has been given or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties, or as determined pursuant to the decision of the CPA Firm, is herein referred to as the " _Final Closing Working Capital Statement_." 

  

 (e) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital Statement, the net adjustment payment payable pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ (the " _Adjustment Payment_ ") and interest thereon shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, to the extent such amount was not previously paid by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_. The Adjustment Payment shall be equal to: (x) Net Working Capital, as reflected on the Final Closing Working Capital Statement minus the Working Capital Amount. The Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Buyer to Seller if positive, and by Seller to Buyer if negative and shall be treated as an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Income Tax Purposes. The Adjustment Payment shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate, which interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and such interest shall be paid on the same date and in the same manner as such Adjustment Payment. Any adjustment or non-adjustment to the Purchase Price shall not form the basis for any claim for damages pursuant to this Agreement. The parties payment obligations under this _Section 2.6_ will not be subject to offset or reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and any right or alleged right of indemnification hereunder or for any other reason or under any other agreement.

Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to minimize any applicable Transfer Taxes. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries on the basis of the relative fair market value of the Shares, the Business Assets and the Seller covenant not to compete described in _Section 5.14_. The initial allocation (the " _Initial Allocation_ ") shall be prepared by Seller for the review and approval of Buyer within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof for the review and approval of Buyer. If within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Initial Allocation, Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days thereafter.

Additionally, Seller and Buyer agree that the portion of the Purchase Price allocated pursuant to the Initial Allocation to businesses where Seller or any Selling Subsidiary is selling assets (including sales of stock where section 338(h)(10) elections are being made) shall be further allocated (the " _Asset Allocation_ ") among the GMS Assets sold by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary as required by Section 1060 of the Code on the basis of the fair market value 

   ##### 

  

 

of the respective assets. In addition, any Adjustment Payment shall be
treated as a Purchase Price adjustment and allocated (the "Adjustment
Allocation") in a manner consistent with the Initial Allocation. The Asset
Allocation and the Adjustement Allocation shall be prepared by Seller for the
review and approval of Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days after the date
on which the Final Closing Working Capital Statement is determined. If within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such allocations, Buyer notifies Seller in
writing that Buyer objects to the allocations, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within twenty (20)
days thereafter. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
such dispute within such twenty (20) days, Buyer and Seller shall, within ten
(10) days after such twenty (20) day period, submit such disputed items to
the CPA Firm for resolution under the procedures set forth in  _Section
2.6(c)_. The final version of the Initial Allocation, the Asset Allocation and
the Adjustment Allocation (the " _Allocation_ ") shall become part of this
Agreement for all purposes. Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and Buyer agree
to report, pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder or any other similar provision under Law, as and when
required, the Allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted hereunder, among
the Shares, GMS Assets and the Seller covenant not to compete described in
_Section 5.14_ in a manner entirely consistent with such Allocation in the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594). Neither
Buyer nor Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation unless required to do so
by Law. 

   

 Section 2.10 _Nonassignability of GMS Assets_. Except for any Business Assets requiring a Material Consent, to the extent that the sale, assignment, lease, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, lease, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer, of any asset, contract, lease, license, right or property that would be a GMS Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any Law or would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed and Buyer shall pay the full Purchase Price at Closing without the sale, assignment, lease, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset (and the failure to obtain such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the failure to sell, assign, convey or deliver such assets shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller), and this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset or an attempt thereof. In the event that the Closing proceeds without the transfer, sublease or assignment of any such asset, then following the Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; provided, however, that neither Seller nor any of the Selling Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consideration or compromise any rights not otherwise required by this Agreement to be compromised for any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, other than filing, recordation or similar fees, which shall be reimbursed by Buyer. Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of such asset and to the Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, as applicable, the benefits, including any indemnities, that it would have obtained had the asset been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to this _Section 2.10_ of any Contract included in the GMS Assets, Buyer shall perform for the benefit of the other Persons that are parties thereto the obligations of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, as 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable, thereunder and pay, discharge and satisfy any related liabilities
that, but for the lack of an authorization, approval, consent or waiver to
assign such liabilities to Buyer, would be Assumed Liabilities. Once
authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, lease,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not sold,
assigned, leased, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the
Closing is obtained, Seller shall and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to
assign, lease, sublease, transfer, convey or deliver such asset to Buyer at
no additional cost to Buyer. To the extent that any such asset cannot be
transferred or the full benefits of use of any such asset cannot be provided
to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.10_, then Seller
shall and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to enter into such
arrangements with Buyer (including leasing, subleasing, sublicensing
or subcontracting) to provide to the parties the economic (taking into
account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the extent
permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and
the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder. Seller or the Selling
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt
thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in connection with their use of any
asset (net of any Taxes and any other costs imposed upon Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries, as the case may be) in connection with the arrangements
under this _Section 2.10_. Except as set forth in this _Section 2.10_,
Buyer agrees that Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any liability
whatsoever (including any liability under  _Article VIII_) to Buyer or its
Affiliates arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers with respect to the GMS Assets
that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or because of the termination of any license, lease, contract, commitment,
agreement or instrument as a result thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 2.10_, unless Buyer otherwise provides written
notice to Seller on the Closing Date, this _Section 2.10_ shall not apply to
any GMS Asset subject to a Material Consent or to any GMS Asset to be
assigned pursuant to the GMS Intellectual Property Asset Transfer
Agreement.

   #####

 (d) (i) There have not been any releases of Hazardous Substances by Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any Acquired Company on, from, or at the Owned Property or on, from, or at the Leased Property or any other locations, that have resulted in, or would otherwise be reasonably likely to form the basis of, a material claim against the Seller, an Acquired Company or a Selling Subsidiary, or has required, or would otherwise be likely to require, remediation by the Seller, an Acquired Company or a Selling Subsidiary pursuant to Environmental Law, (ii) no property now or previously owned, operated or leased by any Acquired Company is listed on the National Priorities List or on CERCLIS (each promulgated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) or any similar list under any other Environmental Law, and (iii) there are not now any underground storage tanks located in or under the Owned Property or the Leased Property.

For clarification, the term "terminates without cause" as used in the preceding sentence shall be interpreted so as to (A) cover an actual termination (not constructive termination), (B) not be applicable in the event of a change in such Transferred Employees duties or job title so long as following such change, such Transferred Employee is receiving at least the amount of compensation he or she was receiving as of the date hereof and the benefits to be provided by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.4_, and (C) include in the definition of "cause" any of the following: neglect of duties, willful failure to act with respect to assigned job duties, willful misconduct, conduct which has the effect of damaging the reputation, professional standing or goodwill of Buyer or any part of the Business, gross misconduct, or breach of any applicable employment agreement or policy. Except as required by Law or an applicable collective bargaining agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, Buyer shall provide severance and other separation benefits to each Transferred Employee terminated by Buyer within six (6) months following the Closing Date (or, in the case of Transferred Employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, the period required therein) that are at least equal to the severance and other separation benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates in effect on the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall recognize service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for purposes of determining the amount of such severance or other separation benefits. 

   

 (ii) Buyer agrees that, with respect to all Transferred Employees, Buyer will (1) honor all accrued but untaken vacation credited to such Transferred Employees under Sellers applicable vacation plans, determined as of the Effective Time, and (2) provide that, for a period of at least nine (9) months after the Closing Date, with respect to each Transferred Employee, the rate of accrual of hours of vacation or other paid-time-off for employment with Buyer or its Affiliates after the Effective Time shall not be less than such rate of accrual with Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (iii) For a period of at least nine (9) months after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to reimburse Transferred Employees for educational expenses 

   ##### 

  

   

incurred prior to the Effective Time but becoming reimbursable under the
terms of Sellers educational assistance plans after the Effective Time to
the same extent that those Transferred Employees would have been reimbursed
under Sellers educational assistance plans if they had remained employees of
Seller or its Affiliates. Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access
to, and copies of, Sellers records necessary to provide the foregoing
benefits. 

   

 (iv) Buyer agrees to recognize each union which at the Closing Date represents any of the Transferred Employees as the collective bargaining representatives of such employees as of the Closing Date and agrees to assume all collective bargaining agreements then covering any Transferred Employees. 

  

 (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, all Transferred Employees shall cease to actively participate in any of Sellers or any Selling Subsidiarys Benefit Plans (hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Seller Benefit Plans_ "). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefits of such Transferred Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans accrued prior to the Effective Time shall be paid to the Transferred Employees by Seller in accordance with the terms of such plans, except to the extent otherwise provided in this _Section 5.4_, including in respect of Sellers Savings Plan. 

  

 (c) Seller shall retain responsibility for providing health continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code (i.e., COBRA health care continuation coverage) relating to employees of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries (or qualified beneficiaries related thereto) that terminated employment or had other qualifying events, either prior to the Closing Date or in conjunction with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or who did not begin employment with Buyer. Buyer shall have responsibility for providing applicable COBRA health care continuation coverage for Transferred Employees whose employment terminates subsequent to the Closing Date. 

  

 (d) Seller shall retain liability for all medical, dental and health claims incurred by Transferred Employees (and their dependents) under Sellers employee welfare benefit plans prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall be liable for all medical, dental and health claims incurred by Transferred Employees (and their dependents) under the employee welfare benefit plans of Buyer at or after the Effective Time. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the medical or other treatment or service was rendered and not the date of the inception of the related illness or injury or the date of submission of a claim related thereto. 

  

 (e) Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall (or shall cause the Business to) establish or amend a cafeteria plan (" _Buyer s Cafeteria Plan_") described under section 125 of the Code for the Transferred Employees who were eligible to participate in such a plan sponsored by Seller (" _Seller s Cafeteria Plan_"). Buyers Cafeteria Plan shall include medical expense reimbursement accounts and dependent care assistance accounts (described under sections 105, 125 or 129 of the Code) (the " _Flex Accounts_ ") as provided in Sellers Cafeteria Plan. As soon as administratively feasible after the Closing, Seller shall transfer to Buyers Cafeteria Plans the account balance of any Flex Accounts maintained by Transferred Employees who participate in Buyers Cafeteria Plan and maintain such Flex Accounts; _provided_ , _however_ , 

   ##### 

  

    

that if the claims made against a Transferred Employees Flex Accounts prior
to his termination of employment by Seller exceeds the amounts in such
account at the Effective Time, Buyer shall reimburse Seller the amount by
which such claims exceed the amounts in such Flex Accounts. 

  

 (f) If a Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer (or its Affiliates), Buyer shall cause such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations for conditions covered under the applicable medical, dental or health plans of Seller and (ii) credit any complete or partial satisfaction of any deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Transferred Employee and his dependents under the applicable Seller medical, dental or health plans during the portion of 2007 preceding the Closing Date. If a Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate in a group term life insurance plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer shall cause such plan to waive any medical certification for such Transferred Employee up to the amount of coverage the Transferred Employee had under the life insurance plan of Seller. 

  

 (g) U.S. Savings Plan Account Transfer. 

   

 (i) Transferred Employees will cease making contributions to the Sellers 401(k) Plan, qualified under Code Sections 401(a) and 401(k) (" _Seller s Savings Plan_") immediately prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, Buyer will establish a new savings plan or designate an existing savings plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) and including a cash or deferred feature under Code Section 401(k) and a related trust thereunder which shall be exempt under Code Section 501(a) (" _Buyer s Savings Plan_") that will permit participation by all Transferred Employees who are participating in Sellers Savings Plan as of the Closing Date (the " _Participating Employees_ "). 

   

 (ii) Buyers Savings Plan shall permit rollovers and direct trust-to-trust transfers of the Participating Employees accounts (including notes evidencing loans) in Sellers Savings Plan to the extent that the tax-qualified status of Buyers Savings Plan is not jeopardized, as reasonably determined by Buyer. 

  

 (h) _Pension Plans_. Buyer shall have no obligation to establish a defined benefit pension plan, including with respect to any Transferred Employees, unless otherwise required by an applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the event that an applicable collective bargaining agreement requires Buyer to establish a defined benefit pension plan, a defined benefit pension plan shall be established (or used if a preexisting defined benefit pension plan exists) as soon as practicable after the Closing Date and need not accept any assets or liabilities from any other plans. Seller shall, at any time (including before or after the Closing Date) if requested by Buyer (or Buyers agents or professional service representatives), provide Buyer (or Buyers agents or professional service representatives) with all reasonable information requested pertaining to the benefits accrued (including related information and calculations) by the Transferred Employees in the Sellers U.S. defined benefit pension plans (the " _Seller s Pension Plans_"). Seller shall provide the Transferred Employees with the necessary post-Closing Date age and/or service credits relating to their service with Buyer after the Closing Date solely for the purpose of providing eligibility relating to any early retirement benefit or subsidy or any 

   ##### 

  

    

other subsidy required by Sellers Pension Plans or the collective bargaining
agreement between Teleflex Automotive and the PACE Local 5-0524 union
employees at the Van Wert, Ohio Facility as in existence on the date hereof.
In no event shall any Transferred Employee receive a benefit from the
Sellers Pension Plans and the Buyers Pension Plan that is, in the
aggregate, greater than that which he would have received from the Sellers
Pension Plan if he had continued in Sellers employ until his retirement
considering prospective collective bargaining agreements and obligations. 

  

 (i) _Foreign Benefit Plans_. 

   

 (i) Buyer will, with respect to any Transferred Employees employed outside the United States in connection with the Business on the Closing Date, in addition to satisfying the employment requirements of _Section 5.4_, adopt or designate new employee benefit plans that will provide benefits, including retirement, health and welfare benefits, to such non-U.S. Transferred Employees that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the employee benefit plans maintained or contributed to for such non-U.S. Transferred Employees by Seller, an Acquired Company or a Selling Subsidiary. 

   

 (ii) Buyer will either assume any separate employee benefit plans covering such non-U.S. Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries, or designate existing employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer, into which the assets and liabilities attributable to such non-U.S. Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries will be transferred as soon as practicable after Closing, and after any necessary approvals by any Governmental Authority have been obtained or, if no such approvals are required, after Seller has received evidence from Buyer, reasonably satisfactory to Seller, that the employee benefit plans adopted or designated by Buyer satisfy all material requirements of Law. 

   

 (iii) At the Effective Time, Buyer and Buyers employee benefit plans shall be solely responsible for retirement, health and welfare benefits to such non-U.S. Transferred Employees, whether accrued before, at or after the Effective Time, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Parties, including Sellers or a Selling Subsidiarys employee benefit plans, from any claims by or through any such non-U.S. Transferred Employee, or by any Governmental Authority, with respect to any such benefits. 

  

 (j) _UK Employees_. 

   

 (i) The provisions of _Sections 5.4(a)_ to _5.4(i)_ , _5.4(k)_  and _5.4(l)_ shall not apply to any of the UK Employees. UK Seller and Buyer acknowledge that pursuant to the UK Regulations the contracts of employment between UK Seller and the UK Employees (except insofar as such contracts relate to any occupational pension scheme as defined in Regulation 10 of the UK Regulations) will have effect from the Effective Time as if originally made between Buyer and the UK Employees. Buyer will make such pension provisions in respect of the UK Employees as complies with its obligations under sections 257 and 258 

   ##### 

  

   

Pensions Act 2004 and the regulations under those sections, namely the
Transfer of Employment (Pension Protection) Regulations 2005. Buyer shall
assume responsibility for all emoluments and outgoings in respect of the UK
Employees (including all wages, bonuses, commissions, holiday entitlements,
PAYE, National Insurance contributions and pensions contributions) in respect
of the period prior to and from the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless UK Seller from any claims made by UK Employees arising out of or in connection with (1) the employment or termination of employment of any UK Employee after the Effective Time and which arise wholly or mainly from any act, omission or default of Buyer after the Effective Time; (2) Buyers failure to give UK Seller the information required from Buyer pursuant to regulation 13 of the UK Regulations to enable UK Seller to comply with its obligations under the UK Regulations; and (3) any actual, proposed or anticipated changes by Buyer to the terms and conditions of employment of the UK Employees (except insofar as the changes relate to any occupational pension scheme as defined in Regulation 10 of the UK Regulations) which amounts to a repudiatory breach of contract as referred to in Regulation 4(11) of the UK Regulations and/or to make changes in working conditions of any UK Employee to the material detriment of such UK Employee. Seller shall indemnify Buyer against all Losses arising from any deliberate or negligent misrepresentation by Seller (other than in accordance with a request or instruction of Buyer) of the measures envisaged by the Buyer in respect of any of the UK Employees and as notified and described by Buyer to Seller prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (k) _No Conflict_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this _Section 5.4_, neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall take any action to reduce, eliminate or otherwise avoid obligations to Transferred Employees under existing collective bargaining agreements, employment contracts or Law in the jurisdiction of employment. 

  

 (l) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 5.4_ , it is understood and agreed that nothing in this Agreement shall constitute any commitment, Contract or understanding (express or implied) of any obligation on the part of Buyer to a post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed term or duration or upon any terms or conditions other than those Buyer may establish or assume in particular employment contracts. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 5.4_, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Transferred Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries or other compensation or terms or conditions of employment of such Transferred Employees. Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the current or former employees of Seller, the Acquired Companies, the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.5 _Books and Records_. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to, or cause the Business to, retain all Books and Records and to make the same available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Seller or its agents at Sellers expense, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Closing Date Financial Information_. For a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing Date, upon written request of Seller, Buyer will provide Seller within twenty (20) Business Days of such request with such computer support and financial information of the Business as of the Closing Date as Seller may reasonably request in the format customarily required by Seller of its subsidiaries or divisions, and, upon Sellers request, it will be accompanied by supplemental financial schedules customarily required by Seller of its subsidiaries or divisions in support of such financial information. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Intellectual Property_. 

  

 (a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Intellectual Property License Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants or shall be deemed to grant to Buyer the right to use or any interest in (i) the name "Teleflex", "TFX", or any trademark, trade name, service mark or other similar mark or similar right which is a derivative of the name "Teleflex" or "TFX" or (ii) any other intellectual property rights of Seller and its Affiliates that is not included in the Business Assets (collectively referred to as the " _Seller Intellectual Property_ "). 

  

 (b) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall use any signs or stationery, purchase order forms, packaging or other similar paper goods or supplies, advertising and promotional materials, product, training and service literature and materials, or computer programs or like materials (collectively, the " _Specified Supplies_ ") that include the word "Teleflex", "TFX" or contain any trademarks, trade names, service marks or corporate or business names, derived from or including the words "Teleflex" or "TFX" (in logotype design or any other style or design) in whole or in part; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent any Specified Supplies include the words "Teleflex", "TFX" or contain any such trademarks, trade names, service marks or corporate or business names, Buyer may, for a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, use such Specified Supplies after first crossing out or marking over such word or trademark, trade name, service mark or corporate or business name and otherwise clearly indicating on such Specified Supplies that the Business is no longer affiliated with Seller. Buyer shall not reorder, produce or reproduce any Specified Supplies that include the words "Teleflex", "TFX" or contain any such trademarks, trade names, service marks or corporate or business names. 

  

 (c) Promptly following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall take all such actions as may be required to change the name of each of the Acquired Companies to one distinctly different in sound and appearance from the Seller Intellectual Property, including filing a name change amendment with the jurisdiction of incorporation and filing an appropriate name change notice in the appropriate office in each jurisdiction where each such corporation is qualified to do business. After the Closing, Buyer will not engage in the transaction of business using the names specified above or any similar variant thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _GMS Intellectual Property Asset Transfer Agreement_. On the Closing Date, Buyer, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver the GMS Intellectual Property Asset Transfer Agreement pursuant to which Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall transfer all Intellectual Property comprising GMS Assets to be transferred to Buyer in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Further Assurances; Cooperation_. 

  

 (a) At any time after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or take any other actions reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and necessary for Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, to satisfy its obligations hereunder. Seller and Buyer shall each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to their respective obligations set forth in  _Article VI_ to be satisfied at or prior to Closing. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with each of the following: (i) complete and accurate copies of the organizational and governing documents, as then currently in effect, of each of the Acquired Companies, to the extent such copies were not made available to Buyer prior to Closing; (ii) a list and description or copy of all Environmental Permits of each Acquired Company and the Business; and (iii) a list and description or copy of all material Permits of each Acquired Company and the Business. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in the assignment or transfer of each Environmental Permits or other material Permits. Sellers obligations under this _Section 5.8(a)_ shall be in addition to its obligations under _Section 2.10_. 

  

 (b) If there are any Material Consents that have not yet been obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) as of the Closing, in the case of each Contract as to which such Material Consents were not obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) (the " _Restricted Material Contracts_ "), Buyer may waive the closing conditions as to any such Material Consent and Seller shall continue its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Material Consents. If Buyer elects to have Seller continue its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Material Consents and the Closing occurs, notwithstanding _Sections 2.1_ and _2.3_ , neither this Agreement nor the Assumption Agreement nor any other document related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Restricted Material Contracts, and following the Closing, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain the Material Consent relating to each Restricted Material Contract as quickly as practicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall be interpreted to require Buyer or Seller to pay any consideration as a condition to obtain such Material Consent. If Buyer elects to proceed with the Closing, and, as of the Closing, an attempted assignment of any Restricted Material Contract would be ineffective or would affect any Sellers rights thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, at Buyers demand at any time after Closing, Seller shall provide an arrangement acceptable to Buyer which would provide Buyer with the benefit (including the economic benefit) and burden (including economic burden) of such Restricted Material Contract (other than legal title). Each party shall bear its own administrative costs in connection with any such arrangement. If and so long after the Closing as such assignment shall not have been made, Seller shall (i) to the extent that such action shall not result in violation of such Restricted Material Contract, transfer to Buyer all assets and rights, 

   ##### 

  

    

including all monies, received in respect of such Restricted Material
Contract and hold such Restricted Material Contract in trust for Buyer, (ii)
to the extent that the provisions of clause (i) above are not sufficient to
transfer all of the benefits (including the economic benefit) and burden
(including economic burden) of such Restricted Material Contract (other than
legal title), or any such Restricted Material Contract has been cancelled as
a result of the attempted assignment, take such actions (which,
without limitation, may include entering into subcontracting arrangements
with Buyer) as are commercially reasonable to provide all of the benefits (or
the equivalent thereof, including the economic benefit) and burden (including
economic burden) of such Restricted Material Contract (other than legal
title) to Buyer. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.8(b)_, Buyer agrees
that Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever
(including any liability under  _Article VIII_) to Buyer or its Affiliates
arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Material Consent to
the extent that Buyer has waived in writing the closing conditions as to such
Material Consent. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Compliance with WARN, EU Directives, etc._  

  

 (a) With respect to the Transferred Employees, Buyer will timely give all notices required to be given under, or will otherwise comply with, WARN or other similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff or as otherwise required by such statute. For this purpose, Buyer shall be deemed to have caused a mass layoff if the mass layoff would not have occurred but for Buyers failure to employ the Transferred Employees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to the non-U.S. GMS Employees, Seller and Buyer accept and agree (i) that the transfer of employment of employees of the UK Seller (hereinafter referred to as " _European Employees_ ") will be effected and governed by the Transfer Provisions (defined below), and accordingly the contract of employment of each European Employee shall be assumed by Buyer or its Affiliate with effect from the Effective Time, which shall be the time of transfer under the Transfer Provisions; (ii) Buyer shall ensure that its Affiliates (where necessary) comply with their respective obligations under the Transfer Provisions and upon request provide Seller or the relevant Affiliate of Seller with such information as will enable either Seller or its Affiliate, as the case may be, to carry out its respective duties under the Transfer Provisions concerning measures to effectuate the transfer of the European Employees to Buyer; and (iii) " _Transfer Provisions_ " means any legislation implementing the provisions of Directive 77/187/EEC commonly called the Acquired Rights Directive or Transfer of Undertakings Directive.

On the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Seller and Buyer shall make available to each other the services described therein on the terms and conditions as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Foreign Implementing Agreements_. If, after the date hereof, either Seller or Buyer reasonably determines or deems it advisable, or if otherwise necessary to commemorate the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller and Buyer shall cause to be prepared and executed by the applicable parties, any additional agreements or instruments implementing the transfer and conveyance to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer at the Effective Time of the Shares 

   ##### 

  

    

of Foreign Subsidiaries or the GMS Assets and the assumption by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities, including those documents,
agreements and instruments required by Law or otherwise customarily executed
and delivered in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries and the UK Seller (the " _Foreign
Implementing Agreements_ "). The parties agree that any Foreign Implementing
Agreements shall not expand or limit the rights and obligations of Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Buyer and its Affiliates,
on the other hand, beyond those provided for in this Agreement, and that the
Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not provide for any additional rights or
obligations of Seller or Selling Subsidiaries, or Buyer or its Affiliates
that are not provided for in this Agreement. The parties shall cooperate in
the preparation of any such Foreign Implementing Agreements, which shall be
prepared in a form suitable for use by the parties in such foreign
jurisdiction. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any such
Foreign Implementing Agreements and this Agreement, the parties agree and
acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement shall control and that, if
necessary, the parties shall deliver such additional instruments as may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 

  

 Section 5.12 _Conveyancing Documents_. At the Closing, Buyer and Seller or a Selling Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver Conveyancing Documents for all of the GMS Real Property in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Disclosure; Investigation_. 

  

 (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller has not made, does not make and specifically negates and disclaims any representations, warranties, promises, covenants, agreements or guaranties of any kind or character whatsoever, whether express or implied, oral or written, past, present, or future, of, as to, concerning or with respect to, except as to the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements (and solely to the extent) specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Conveyancing Documents and the Ancillary Agreements: (i) the nature, quality or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Business, the Business Assets, the Business Liabilities or the Facilities, including the environmental conditions existing thereon; (ii) the suitability of the Business Assets or the Facilities for any and all activities and uses that Buyer may conduct therewith or thereon (iii) the compliance of or by the Business Assets or the Facilities or their operation with any Laws; (iv) the manner or quality of the construction or materials, if any, incorporated into the Business Assets or the Facilities; (v) the manner, quality, state of repair or lack of repair of the Business Assets or the Facilities; and (vi) any other matter with respect to the physical condition of the Business Assets or the Facilities.

 (a) Seller agrees that during the Seller Non-Compete Period, neither Seller nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall engage, manage, operate or have any ownership interest in any firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship or other business entity that engages in, manages or operates a business that competes with the Business (each, a " _Competing Business_ ") anywhere in the world; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this  _Section 5.14(a)_ for Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates (i) to own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person that are traded on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a recognized securities exchange outside the U.S.) if Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates (x) is not a controlling Person or a member of a group that controls such Person and (y) does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 5% or more of the voting securities of such Person, (ii) to acquire, directly or indirectly, the equity or assets of, or otherwise become affiliated with or participate in, any enterprise engaged in a Competing Business if Seller shall use reasonable efforts to divest, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within eighteen (18) months after the closing date of such acquisition, its interest in such enterprise relating to the Competing Business), (iii) to continue operating existing lines of business, other than the Business, or any of the Excluded Assets or (iv) to perform the activities contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements.

acquisition, its interest in such enterprise relating to the Buyer Competing
Business), (iii) to continue operating existing lines of business, or (iv)
to perform the activities contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements. None of

Person shall not utilize any of the Business Assets to engage in any Buyer
Competing Business.

 (e) If any provision contained in this _Section 5.14_ shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

estimated Tax Refunds (all such Tax Returns, amended returns and refund
applications are referred to as the " _Prior Period Returns_ "). The Prior
Period Returns shall be prepared, where relevant, in a manner consistent with
Sellers past practices except as otherwise required by Law. Seller shall pay
all Taxes related to such Prior Period Returns and shall be entitled to all

Buyer shall prepare all Straddle Period Tax Returns in a manner consistent with Sellers past practices, except as otherwise required by Law. Except as provided below with respect to Income Taxes, Buyer shall pay all Taxes related to such Straddle Periods. With respect to Income Taxes only, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of such Income Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period of such Straddle Period, to the extent that such Income Taxes are not reflected in the Final Closing Working Capital Statement or paid by Seller or the Acquired Companies prior to Closing, including amounts paid in respect of estimated Income Taxes. Buyer shall deliver to Seller, for its review and comment, a draft of each Straddle Period Income Tax Return at least sixty (60) days prior to the applicable filing deadline of such Straddle Period Income Tax Return, together with a proposed calculation of the Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period of such return. Such Straddle Period Income Tax Return and proposed calculation shall be binding on Seller, unless, within twenty-one (21) days following receipt thereof, Seller shall deliver to Buyer written notice of any objection with respect to the calculation of Taxes on such Straddle Period Income Tax Return or the portion of such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disputes with respect to such calculations within fourteen (14) days following delivery of Sellers written notice of objection, such dispute shall be submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses of the CPA Firm in connection with its review and resolution of the dispute shall be allocated 50% to Buyer and 50% to Seller. If the CPA Firm is unable to make its determination with respect to any disputed item prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing such Straddle Period Income Tax Return, then Buyer may treat such item, solely for purposes of filing the applicable Straddle Period Income Tax Return, as it determined in its sole discretion, and may cause the Straddle Period Income Tax Return to be filed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in such case, the CPA Firm shall make its determination with respect to the disputed items and the determination of the CPA Firm shall control the rights of the parties under this Agreement. Income Taxes for any Straddle Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time. Buyer and Seller shall share, in the same proportion as they shared Straddle Period Income Taxes, any Straddle Period Income Tax refunds. Buyer shall remit any such Income Tax refund to Seller within five (5) Business Days of its receipt thereof. 

  

 (c) Following the Closing, except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.16(f)_, Seller shall indemnify and hold the Buyer Parties and the Acquired Companies harmless from and against (i) any Income Taxes of the Acquired Companies related to the Prior Period Returns,

(ii) any increase in Income Taxes of the Acquired Companies attributable to
adjustment of items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit allocable to
the Pre-Closing Period of a Straddle Period Income Tax Return and (iii) any
Taxes of any other Person for which any of the Acquired Companies may become
liable pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or analogous provisions
of state, local or non-U.S. Law) as a result of being a member of a
consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations prior to the Closing
Date; and (iv) any VAT attributable to a failure to comply with relevant
transfer pricing Laws prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller following receipt of any notice of audit or other administrative or judicial proceeding relating to any matter for which Seller may be required to indemnify Buyer and the Acquired Companies pursuant to _Section 5.16(c)_. Seller shall have the right to control any and all audits or other proceedings relating to any Tax period that ends on or before the Closing Date (a " _Contest_ "), including the filing of any amended returns. If Seller elects to control a Contest for any Tax for which it has any liability under this Agreement, Seller shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability, notify Buyer, in writing, of its intent to do so, and the Buyer shall cooperate and shall cause the Acquired Companies to cooperate, at Sellers expense, in each phase of such Contest. If Seller elects to control a Contest for any Tax for which it has any liability under this Agreement, then Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but not control) such Contest, with its own counsel and at its own expense. If Seller does not provide Buyer written notice of its intent to control a Contest for any Tax for which it has any liability under this Agreement within thirty (30) days following receipts of the notice of the asserted Tax liability, then Buyer may assume control of such Contest and look to the Seller for the full amount of the reasonable costs of such Contest. However, in such case, neither Buyer nor the Acquired Companies may settle or compromise any asserted Tax liability without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall have the right to control all Contests relating to any Straddle Period Tax Return other than any Income Tax Return for a Straddle Period for which Seller has provided Buyer notice hereinabove of its intent to control such Contest, including the filing of an amended return. 

  

 (e) Following the Closing, to the extent not reflected on the Final Closing Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of any refund, realized Tax credit or similar benefit realized by, or with respect to, any of the Acquired Companies with respect to a Prior Period Return or the Pre-Closing Period of a Straddle Period Tax Return.

Reg. section 1.1502-6 (or analogous provisions of state or local law) as a result of its being a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations that included any of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date) over the amount of Taxes of Seller and its Affiliates otherwise due from the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery of the GMS Assets resulting from (i) any actions taken, or caused to be taken, by Buyer following the Closing with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business (as conducted prior to Closing), (ii) any dividends paid by any of the Foreign Subsidiaries during any of their taxable years that include the Closing Date, (iii) any

The Forms shall be prepared in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations (or, if applicable, comparable provisions of state and local income tax law). The Buyer shall have forty-five (45) days following the receipt of the Forms from the Seller to notify the Seller in writing whether or not the Buyer accepts the Forms as prepared by the Seller. If the Buyer notifies the Seller that it does not accept any of the Forms, it shall set out in reasonable detail in the written notice its reasons for non-acceptance and specify the adjustments, which, in its opinion, should be made. The Seller and the Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the adjustments, if any, to be made to the Forms.

Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Section 5.21(e)_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price; and the amount of any indemnification payable to Seller or a Subsidiary shall be grossed up to reflect the Income Tax ultimately .payable by such Person. Seller shall provide Buyer with its determination of the amount of indemnification payment due Seller and its Subsidiaries hereunder, which determination shall be accompanied by work papers and other calculations reasonably necessary to demonstrate the accuracy of the determination.

 (b) The parties intend that section 49 VATA and Article 5 Special Provisions Order will apply to the transfer of the UK Assets and Seller and Buyer will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure that pursuant to the provisions referred to above the sale of the UK Assets is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for the purposes of VAT but as the transfer of a business as a going concern; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 5.22(b)_ shall require either Seller or the UK Seller to request a review of any determination by HMRC or any notification by HMRC that section 49 VATA and Article 5 Special Provisions Order does not apply to the transfer of the UK Assets.

Buyer agrees to promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which Seller is obligated to pay any Carrier Reimbursement) to pay to Seller an amount equal to the Carrier Reimbursement with respect to claims asserted by the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

respect thereto, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) the operation of the Business or the Business Assets by or
on behalf of Buyer after the Effective Time or (iv) any Business Liability.

 Section 8.3  _Method of Asserting Claims, etc._ In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have ninety (90) days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. An election to assume the defense of such claim or demand shall not be deemed to be an admission that the Indemnifying Party is liable to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in its defense of the third party claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings. If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense 

   ##### 

  

    

or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnified
Party shall not settle a claim or demand without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand
on a basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of
the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or Affiliate thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a claim
or demand for which the Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation
hereunder, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice
as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand,
or, if the same be contested by the Indemnified Party, then that portion
thereof as to which such defense of the claim by the Indemnifying Party is
unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to
such defense) shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder,
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_. To the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall control or participate in the defense or
settlement of any third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party will
give the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access to, during normal business
hours, the relevant business records and other documents, and shall permit
them to consult with the employees and counsel of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall use its best efforts in the defense of all such
claims. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
state specifically the representation, warranty, or covenant with respect to
which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the
claim and the estimated amount of the liability asserted against the
Indemnifying Party by reason of the claim. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Indemnification Amounts_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall not have liability under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of Buyers Losses attributable to indemnification claims for which a Claim Notice was properly delivered to Seller pursuant to _Section 8.3_ exceeds $12,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case Buyer shall be entitled to Losses attributable to indemnification claims in an amount up to fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate (the " _Cap Amount_ "); provided, however, that Seller shall be liable only for the amount by which all Losses (up to the Cap Amount) under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ exceed the Basket Amount;  _provided_ , _furthe_ r, that no individual claim for payment of a Loss may be made under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ unless such claim is an amount of $25,000 or greater (the " _Individual Claim Threshold_ "); and provided, further, (i) that the Basket Amount, Cap Amount and Individual Claim Threshold limitations shall not apply to any Losses arising under _Sections 3.1_,  _3.2_ (with respect to subsection (a) thereof only), _3.5(a)_ (with respect to the last sentence thereof only), _3.6(a)_ (with respect to the first sentence thereof only),  _3.11_ , _3.13_ (with respect to Losses resulting or arising from breaches of representations and warranties therein with respect to Retained Benefit Plans only),  _Section_ _3.14(f)_ (with respect to the first sentence thereof only) and _Section 3.15_ ; and (ii) with respect to any Losses arising under _Section 3.21_, Buyer shall, subject to the Basket Amount and the Individual Claim Threshold, be entitled to Losses in excess of the Cap Amount, with such excess being equal to the difference between $160,000,000 and the Cap Amount. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall not have liability under _Sections 8.2(b)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of Sellers Losses attributable to indemnification claims for which a Claim Notice was 

   ##### 

  

    

properly delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.3_ exceeds $12,500,000
(the " _Buyer Basket Amount_ "), in which case Seller shall be entitled to
Losses attributable to indemnification claims in an amount up to fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate (the " _Buyer Cap
Amount_ "); provided, however, that Buyer shall be liable only for the amount
by which all Losses (up to the Buyer Cap Amount) under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_
exceed the Buyer Basket Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that no individual
claim for payment of a Loss may be made under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ unless
such claim is an amount of $25,000 or greater (the " _Buyer Individual Claim
Threshold_ "); and provided, further, that the above Buyer Basket Amount,
Buyer Cap Amount and Buyer Individual Claim Threshold limitations shall
not apply to any Losses arising under _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ (with respect to
subsection (a) thereof only) or _4.4_. 

  

 Section 8.5  _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc._ The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under _Sections 8.2_ or  _8.8_ shall be net of (a) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (b) any insurance or other sources of reimbursement actually recovered with respect to such Loss (each source named in clauses (a) and (b), a " _Collateral Source_ "), (c) with respect to claims under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, any amounts paid by Seller pursuant to _Section 8.8_ with respect to such Loss and (d) accruals or reserves (or overstatement of liabilities in respect of actual liability) included in the Financial Information or the Final Closing Working Capital Statement. In addition, the Indemnifying Party will have no liability in respect of any Losses arising under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, (i) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, to the extent they arise or are incurred as a result of the passing of, or a change in, any law or administrative practice of a Governmental Authority after the Closing Date, (ii) if they would not have arisen but for any reasonable act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried out at the request of or consent of the Indemnified Party before Closing or (iii) if they would not have arisen solely but for any material voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried out after Closing by the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys respective directors, employees or agents or successors in title other than in the ordinary course of the Business. The parties shall take and shall cause their Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the extent reasonably necessary to remedy a breach that gives rise to the Loss and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due from Collateral Sources. The parties acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation shall accrue or inure to the benefit of any Collateral Source hereunder. The Indemnifying Party may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such recovery at its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under _Sections 8.2_ or _8.8_ is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party to this _Article VIII_, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Article VIII_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment. 

  

 Section 8.6 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. Except in the case of actual fraud, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall be the parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject 

   ##### 

  

    

matter of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. No amount shall be
recoverable under this Agreement by any Seller Party or Buyer Party to the
extent such Seller Party or Buyer Party has asserted a claim or received
indemnification for such Loss under any Ancillary Agreement. In furtherance
of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive and release (and agree to cause
their respective Affiliates to waive and release), to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, except for claims of actual fraud, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if
any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in
the future, that it may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, arising under or based
upon any federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or
judicial decision (including any such statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation or judicial decision relating to environmental matters or arising
under or based upon any securities law, ERISA common law or otherwise) in
respect of the subject matter of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
The parties shall be entitled to such remedies as shall be available at law
or in equity with respect to any willful breach of this Agreement prior to
the Closing, or if this Agreement is terminated to the extent provided in

otherwise retain payment, reimbursement or restitution more than once in
respect of the same loss or liability. This _Section 8.6_ shall survive
Closing. 

  

 Section 8.7 _No Consequential or Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnified Party for any consequential or punitive damages or for diminution in value or loss of profit that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the performance or breach thereof or any liability retained or assumed hereunder other than damages paid to an unaffiliated third party claimant. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Response Actions for Releases of Hazardous Substances_. 

  

 (a) Following the Closing, in the event there is any investigation, remediation or other response or compliance action pertaining to the Release of Hazardous Substances in connection with the Business with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to _Article VIII_ (" _Response Action_ "), the Indemnifying Party may choose whether to perform the Response Action or pay for performance by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Response Actions required for Seller to comply with its Transfer Act obligations pursuant to _Section 5.18_ above, Seller or, at its election, the applicable Selling Subsidiary, shall be the Performing Party. The party performing the Response Action shall be referred to as the " _Performing Party_." 

  

 (b) The Performing Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid and minimize any damage to real or personal property or harm to any persons, and to minimize any interference with or disruption of the other partys operations and business. All required Response Actions shall be diligently and expeditiously performed. The other party shall reasonably cooperate with the Performing Party, including providing reasonable access to perform necessary Response Actions. 

  

 (c) The Performing Party shall select an environmental consultant who is reasonably satisfactory to the other party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) All Response Actions shall meet the Appropriate Remediation Standard. The "Appropriate Remediation Standard" shall mean the least stringent, publicly available or routinely applied remediation standards, regulations, ordinances or other requirements of Environmental Laws imposed by any applicable Governmental Authority with jurisdiction consistent with the current use of the property. The parties agree to utilize customary institutional and engineering controls and environmental use restrictions as reasonably available to satisfy the Appropriate Remediation Standard and to cooperate in obtaining all necessary approvals of the use of such controls. Such controls or restrictions may include: (a)(i) prohibitions on use of the property for any purpose other than for industrial/commercial activity, (ii) rendering soil environmentally isolated or inaccessible (with provision reasonably acceptable to Buyer for access and modification if needed in Buyers business judgment and in a manner protective of the risks and pathways for which the isolation or containment was established) and (iii) prohibitions on the use of groundwater for drinking water purposes; (b) petitioning the applicable regulatory authority to change the groundwater classification underlying the property or agreeing to a groundwater classification area or well restriction area; (c) applying for one or more variances, including technical impracticability variances; or (d) any other available methods that otherwise allow Seller to achieve compliance with the Appropriate Remediation Standards; _provided_ , that the foregoing would be consistent with the use of the property at Closing. 

  

 (e) The Performing Party shall (i) notify the other party prior to commencing, performing or completing any Response Actions, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of the progress of any Response Actions and provide copies of any final proposed response, remediation, investigation or sampling plans and the results of sampling and analysis (including any status reports of work in progress or reports required to be submitted to any Governmental Authority or third party), (iii) provide the other party an opportunity to attend, at its cost and expense, any meeting with any Governmental Authority regarding the Response Actions and (iv) provide the other party an opportunity to obtain splits of any samples obtained in the course of conducting Response Actions. 

  

 (f) Neither party shall be responsible or liable to the other under the indemnities provided in _Article VIII_ for any Losses (including the cost and expenses associated with any Response Action) incurred to achieve remediation standards in excess of the Appropriate Remediation Standards, or for Response Actions not required under applicable Environmental Laws or by any Governmental Authority or required as a result of Non-Required Testing. " _Non-Required Testing_ " means any and all environmental sampling, testing and analyses of the ambient or indoor air, soils, groundwater, surface waters, interior of any building or building components that is not required under applicable Environmental Laws or the requirements of any Governmental Authority to meet an Appropriate Remediation Standard. 

  

 (g) In no event shall Seller or any post-Closing Affiliate of Seller be responsible for any Response Action required as a consequence of a Release, threat of Release or any other occurrence following the Closing or any exacerbation of any environmental condition on or after Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates, their successors or assigns or anyone acting by or on their behalf. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) In the event of a conflict between this _Section 8.8_ and the other Sections in  _Article VIII_, this _Section 8.8_ shall control. 

  

 (i) Subject to the provisions of Article VIII, in respect of any Real Property located in the United Kingdom, Seller and Buyer agree that if any remediation notice served on either of them or any Environmental Authority wishes to recover the costs of a remediation action under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, then, as between Seller and Buyer, the sole responsibility for complying with such notice or requirement or payment of such costs is to rest with Buyer to the exclusion of Seller. Buyer and Seller agree that the provisions of this _Section 8.8(i)_ constitute an agreement on liabilities for the purpose of Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the statutory guidance issued in respect of it (including, without limitation, paragraph D38 of DETR circular 01/2006) and the parties acknowledge that either party may show it to any Environmental Authority for the purpose of establishing any allocation of liability in the event of any action by an Environmental Authority. 

  

 Section 8.9 _No Set-Off_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to setoff any Losses (including indemnification obligations under _Sections 8.2_ and _8.8_ ) against any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or otherwise.

 (e) by the non-breaching party, by giving written notice of such termination to the other party, if, there has been a breach by such other party of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, which breach is the sole cause of the failure of the conditions in _Article _ VI to be satisfied, and such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of the date that is six (6) months after the date hereof and the date which is thirty (30) days after the breaching partys receipt of written notice of such breach.
