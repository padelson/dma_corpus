the Estimated Financial Debt; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

the Estimated Working Capital Excess (if any); 

|

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

the estimation of the Price, calculated in accordance with Section 4.1 (the

five million) the Sellers and the Purchaser will promptly consult in good
faith in an effort to mutually agree upon the Provisional Price and, absent

contained in the Purchaser's Proposal will be final and binding upon the

Sellers to the Purchaser within 25 (twenty five) Business Days following the
date on which the Purchaser's Proposal is delivered to the Sellers;

(c) for the purpose of the verification of the Reference Date Accounts and of
the Purchaser's calculation of the Price, the Purchaser shall cause the
management of each of the Group Companies to reasonably cooperate with the
Sellers, in accordance with their reasonable instructions. After Closing, such
cooperation shall include, without limitation, access, including through their
consultants and advisors, to any relevant books and records and employees of
the Group Companies during normal business hours and without disruption of the
Group Companies activity;

(d) if a Notice of Disagreement is notified to the Purchaser as provided in

may have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement; (e) if the Parties are able to reach said amicable solution with respect to
all of the items disputed in the Notice of Disagreement, the amounts of (i)
the Closing Date Cash; (ii) the Closing Date Financial Debt; (iii) the Closing
Date Working Capital; (iv) the Closing Date Working Capital Deficiency or the
Closing Date Working Capital Excess, as the case may be; (v) the determination
of the Price; and (vi) the calculation of the Price Adjustment as agreed in
writing between the Parties shall become final and binding to the Parties;

(f) if, at the end of the Conciliation Period, the Parties fail to reach an
agreement in writing with respect to all of the matters which are the subject
matter of the Notice of Disagreement then (x) all of the matters in relation
to which an agreement has been reached in writing by the Parties shall become
final and binding to the Parties while (y) all of the matters that are still
in dispute (the "Disputed Matters") shall be submitted by any of the Parties
to the auditing firm KPMG, Milan office, or, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to serve as provided in this Section 4.3, another mutually agreed
internationally recognized accounting firm that is not the audit firm either

to be made within the following 15 (fifteen) Business Days;

(ii) the mandate to the Independent Expert shall be substantially in the form
of the Independent Expert's standard engagement letter, save for reasonable

definitions, criteria and other applicable terms and other provisions contained in this Agreement and the Accounting Principles as

the Mosiewicz Family referred to in Section 1.4(b) (Responsibility of the
Parties; Spig Holding's Minimum Capitalization) been duly complied with, with
express exclusion of any further indemnification and hold harmless obligation
of the Members of the Mosiewicz Family.

The Sellers' or Spig Holding's or the Members of the Mosiewicz Family's
indemnification for the Losses above shall be governed by the terms provided
for hereunder (the "Indemnification").

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that any Loss to be indemnified
by Spig Holding and/or Ambienta and/or the Members of the Mosiewicz Family, as
the case may be, shall be indemnified, after having applied all the exclusions
and limitations set out in this Article 10, on a Euro per Euro basis, without
taking into consideration any EBITDA multiples or price-earnings or any other
criteria or assumptions, expressly or implicitly, applied and taken into
consideration by the Purchaser in determining and agreeing with the Sellers
the Price. |

10.2

|

Responsibility of the Sellers 

The Sellers responsibility for Indemnification shall be on a several basis
with exclusion of any joint liability relationship among them and in
particular:

(a) each of the Sellers shall be responsible for 100% of the Losses deriving
from the respective breach of (i) Sellers' Warranties provided for in Section
8.1 and (ii) covenants and obligations of the Sellers set forth in this
Agreement;

(b) Spig Holding shall be responsible for 100% of the Losses deriving from the
breach of the Spig Holding's Warranties in relation to any of the Group
Companies other than SPIG (Shanxi) Cooling Technology Company Ltd., in respect
of which Spig Holding shall be responsible for 60% of the Losses deriving from
the breach of Spig Holding's Warranties in relation thereto (the applicable
percentage of Spig Holding's liability for the Losses contemplated by this
paragraph (b), the "Relevant Percentage").

|

10.3

|

Exclusion and Limitations 

| 
---|--- 

10.3.1

|

No Duplication 

The amount of the Indemnification shall be with exclusion of any duplication
which may be due to the fact that the same Loss derives from the breach of
more than one of Sellers' Warranties and/or Spig Holding's Warranties, as the
case may be, or with exclusion of any Loss which was taken into account in
determining the Price pursuant to Article 4 (Purchase Price and Payments).

In case Spig Holding and/or Ambienta, as the case may be, have indemnified the
Purchaser for a Loss suffered or incurred by any of the Group Companies, the
correspondent Loss suffered by the Purchaser or by its controlling company
because of the diminished value of the participation will not constitute a
loss to be indemnified.

| 
---|--- 

10.3.2

|

Deductions 

The amount of the Indemnification shall be the entire amount of the Loss (or
the Relevant Percentage thereof, in case of breach of Spig Holding's
Warranties), less:

(a) the amount of the provisions, if any, included in the Financial
Statements, in the DCS Financials or in the accounting books of the Group
Companies specifically with respect to the matter originating the Loss (or the
Relevant Percentage thereof, in case of breach of Spig Holding's Warranties),
provided that amounts of such provisions that are referred to a specific claim
or matter and then prove to be overstated or unnecessary in connection with such claim or matter may be utilized against other claims
or matters of the same nature encompassed by the same provision;

(b) any insurance proceeds recovered and, in general, any recoveries paid to
the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies by third parties with respect to
the matter originating the Loss (or the Relevant Percentage thereof, in case
of breach of Spig Holding's Warranties), net of costs of recovery or payment,
provided that, (i) the Purchaser shall diligently pursue any recovery to be
made under existing insurance policies or pursuant to existing rights towards
third parties; and (ii) if the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies
recovers any such amount from any such third party after receiving
Indemnification from Spig Holding and/or Ambienta, as the case may be, for the
same Loss pursuant to the provisions hereof, then such recovered amount shall
be promptly reimbursed to Spig Holding and/or Ambienta, as the case may be, up
to the amount of the Indemnification previously received from them in
connection with that Loss;

(c) the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Group Companies for
the entry in their respective accounts of the cost associated with any such
Loss, it being specified and agreed that the Tax benefit, if any, shall be
conventionally calculated at a rate equal to the income Tax rate applicable
from time to time for the Group Companies, irrespective of the Tax benefit
actually realized.

In addition to the above, in case of any Tax assessments that only results in
the shifting of the Tax burden from one fiscal year to another, and only to
the extent the relevant Group Company is in the position to recover the amount
challenged, any liabilities of Spig Holding and/or Ambienta, as the case may
be, pursuant to this Article 10 (Indemnification) shall be limited to the
actual net and final cash cost for the time/value thereof incurred by the
relevant Group Company.

| 
---|--- 

10.3.3

|

Exclusions 

Subject to Section 10.3.7 (Special Indemnities), the Sellers and/or Spig
Holding shall not be liable for Indemnification:

(a) in connection with any facts or matters which are referred to or disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedule (excluding however any update or supplement thereto
as per Section 8.4 (Supplements to Disclosures)) or elsewhere in this
Agreement or in the Annexes thereto, excluding however Annex 1.2 (f); or

(b) limited to Claims of Indemnification for breach of covenants as per
Section 10.1(a)(iii) and/or Section 10.1(c), if the Purchaser has not given
the Sellers first the opportunity to remedy the breach within a reasonable period of time after the Claim is notified to the Sellers by the Purchaser as
set forth by the Agreement, provided that such grace period shall be
disregarded and not taken into account in calculating the terms and deadlines
set forth in Section 10.7;

(c) if and to the extent that the Losses for which indemnification is sought
in whole or in part directly derive from changes in accounting methods or
decrease in coverage of the insurance policies of the Group Companies or any
other voluntary act or omission of the Purchaser or of the Group Companies
after the Closing Date;

(d) if and to the extent the Losses, in whole or in part, arise or are
increased as a direct result of the enactment of new legislation after the
date of this Agreement, or a change in legislation existing as at the date of
this Agreement, including (but not limiting the generality of the foregoing)
any Tax legislation;

(e) in respect of any contingent or potential Loss, unless and until such Loss
has become actual and due and payable by the relevant Group Company, provided
however that the Purchaser will be entitled to validly and timely give notice
of a Claim under Sections 10.3.6 (Time Limits) and 10.7 (Handling of Claims)
even if the Loss is still not actual or incurred but only potential or
contingent, provided that the Sellers' and/or Spig Holding's Indemnification
will arise if and when the Loss becomes actual; or

(f) in respect of any indirect loss, consequential loss or punitive damages
whatsoever, unless awarded in a Third Party Claim; or

(g) if and to the extent a Loss would have been avoided had the Purchaser or
the relevant Group Company exercised ordinary care and diligence.

claim for Breach of Warranty Indemnification in excess of the Cap (or the
portion of any such claim exceeding the Cap) shall be made and indemnifiable
under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the WandI Policy,
provided that in case for any reason whatsoever the WandI Policy does not enter
into force on or after the Closing Date it will be the exclusive
responsibility of the Purchaser and the Cap will not be increased for any
reason whatsoever, without prejudice however to Sections 10.3.5 (Exceptions to
Monetary Thresholds) and 10.3.7 (Special Indemnities).

| 
---|--- 

10.3.5

Handling of Claims 

If any event occurs which would give rise to the liability of any of the

following provisions shall apply.

| 
---|--- 

10.7.1

|

Claims of Indemnification The Indemnified Party will give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying

copy of the relevant available documents, within 30 (thirty) Business Days
after becoming aware of the occurrence of such indemnifiable event, provided,
however, that failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced by such failure, and:

(a) within 30 (thirty) days of receipt of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the Indemnified Party the amount (if any) specified in the Claim,
unless by the end of such 30-day period the Indemnifying Party delivers to the
Indemnified Party a notice of disagreement in respect of the Claim;

(b) if a notice of disagreement is so delivered, for a period of 30 (thirty)
days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice of
disagreement, the Parties shall attempt to resolve any differences which they
may have with respect to any disputed matters as set forth in the notice of
disagreement;

(c) if, by the end of the 30-day period referred to in (b) above, the Parties
fail to reach an agreement in writing with respect to all the disputed matters
set forth in the notice of disagreement, then all matters in relation to which
agreement is not so reached may, at any time thereafter, be submitted by any
of the Parties to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.2 (Arbitration).

10.7.2

|

Third Party Claims 

In the event of any action, claim or Proceedings initiated by any Person other
than the Parties or their Affiliates against the Group Companies, including
claims made by Tax Authorities (any such claim, a "Third Party Claim"), the
Purchaser shall deliver prompt notice of such claim to Spig Holding and/or
Ambienta, as the case may be, and:

(a) Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case may be, may, at their expense,
decide to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim, appointing
counsel of their choosing and confirming to the Purchaser in writing that it
or they (as applicable) shall provide Indemnification to the Purchaser (or the
relevant Group Company) in relation to the outcome of their defense of the
Third Party Claim. In such an event, the Sellers shall properly and diligently
defend the Third Party Claim and the Purchaser may participate, at its own
expense or at the relevant Group Company\'s expense, in such defence with
counsel of its own choice. The Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to
reasonable cooperate with Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case may be, so as
long as the relevant Seller(s) is/are conducting the defence of the Third Party Claim, including making evidence
available which is within the control of the Group Companies (subject to
precautions aimed at protecting confidential information) and persons needed
as witnesses who are employed by the Group Companies, in each case as
reasonably needed for such defence;

(b) If Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case may be, either (i) elect not to
assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) having elected
to assume such control, thereafter fail to defend the Third Party Claim within
a reasonable time, then the Purchaser shall be entitled to assume such
control, and Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case may be, may participate,
at their own expense, in such defence with counsel of their own choice,
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, provided that they shall be bound by
the results obtained by the Purchaser with respect to the defense of the Third
Party Claim. In the circumstances contemplated by this paragraph (b), the
Purchaser shall properly and diligently defend, and shall cause the Group
Companies to properly and diligently defend, the Third Party Claim;

(c) the Purchaser shall not (and shall cause the relevant Group Companies not
to) propose or accept any settlement of any Third Party Claim, nor shall the
Purchaser (or the relevant Group Company) acquiesce thereto, without the prior
written consent of Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case may be, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

(d) if a firm offer is made to any of the Group Companies or to the Purchaser
to settle a Third Party Claim, which Spig Holding and Ambienta, as the case
may be, but not the Purchaser, are willing to accept, the Purchaser and/or the
Group Companies (as the case may be) shall be free not to enter into such
settlement and to commence or continue litigation, at their own expense, but
Spig Holding and/or Ambienta's, as the case may be, liability for
Indemnification shall be limited to the amount of the proposed settlement.

| 
---|--- 

10.7.3

|

Cooperation of the Indemnified Party 

In the event of any Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give the
Indemnifying Party reasonable access to its books and records and employees
(including, with regard to the Purchaser, the Group Companies') in connection
with the matters for which indemnification is sought, to the extent necessary
for the Indemnifying Party to assess the Claim, exercise its rights and
perform its obligations under this Article 10 (Indemnification).

| 
---|--- 

10.8

|

Payments of Indemnification The amount of any indemnification due by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party under this Article 10 shall be paid within 15 (fifteen)
Business Days from, as the case may be:

(a) the expiration of the 30-day term for the Indemnifying Party to deliver a
notice of disagreement in respect of a Claim pursuant to Section 10.7.1
(Claims of Indemnification) letter (a) without such notice being delivered to
the Indemnified Party;

(b) the date of the agreement between the Indemnifying Party and the

MISCELLANEOUS 

| 
---|--- 

12.1

|

Confidentiality and Announcements 

Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process, or by
other requirements of Law or stock exchange regulations or Authorities, or
disclosed in an action or Proceedings brought by a Party hereto in pursuit of
its rights or in exercise of its remedies hereunder, each Party shall - and
shall use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and its officers,
employees, counsels, accountants, financial advisors, consultants or other
representatives to - keep confidential the existence and the contents of this
Agreement and all documents and information concerning the other Party or any of its Affiliates or the Group Companies furnished to
it by the other Party in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction.

Beside the press release to be issued upon the execution of this Agreement,
which the Parties have agreed upon and shall be substantially in the form as
Annex 12.1, neither Party shall make any public announcements or issue press
releases without previously agreeing with the other Parties the contents and
timing thereof, provided however that each Party may make all announcements
and disclosures that legal counsel to a Party may determine to be required by
applicable Laws or stock exchange regulations or Authorities, previously
consulting, to the extent that it is feasible, the other Parties concerning
such announcements and disclosures.

| 
---|--- 

12.2

|

Expenses, Costs and Fees 

The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each bear their own expenses, costs and
fees (including, without limitation, brokers, investment bankers, finders,
attorneys and auditors fees) in connection with the Transaction, including the
preparation and execution of this Agreement and compliance with its terms.

The costs associated with the transfer of the Shares (such as notarial costs,
the so-called Tobin Tax and others, if any) shall be paid by the Purchaser.

| 
---|--- 

12.3

|

Succession and Assignment 

This Agreement is binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or respective interests, rights and
obligations deriving from this Agreement to any third party, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, save for the right of the Purchaser to
nominate the Designee upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article 3
(Right of Designation) above.

| 
---|--- 

12.4

|

Waiver 

No Party shall have been deemed to have waived rights arising out of this
Agreement or out of any default or breach hereunder by any of the other
Parties, unless such Party acknowledges such waiver in writing.

No waiver of any default or breach of a provision hereof shall be construed as
to constitute a waiver of any further default or breach thereunder, whether
similar or not, or as a waiver of the provisions itself. | 
---|--- 

12.5

|

Entire Agreement 

This Agreement (i) supersedes any previous agreements or understandings among
the Parties, written or verbal; (ii) represents (together with any documents
annexed or referred to herein) the entire agreement among the Parties; and

understanding between the Parties, whether written or verbal, in each case
concerning the subject matter hereof.

---|--- 

12.6

|

Amendments 

Any modifications or amendments to the Agreement shall only be valid and
binding if in writing and duly signed by the Parties.

| 
---|--- 

12.7

|

Severability 

In the event that a provision of this Agreement is or becomes void or
unenforceable, this shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement. In lieu of the void or unenforceable
provision the Parties shall agree upon a valid and enforceable provision which
comes as close as possible to the economic objectives of the void or
unenforceable provision. If such a replacement is legally not possible, the
Parties shall without undue delay give all declarations and take all actions,
which are necessary in order to replace the void or unenforceable provision by
a corresponding effective one.

| 
---|--- 

12.8

|

Counterparts 

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which shall, taken together, be
considered one and the same agreement.

|

GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION AND JURISDICTION 

| 
---|--- 

14.1

|

Governing Law 

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of Italy.

| 
---|--- 

14.2

|

Arbitration 

All disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be exclusively
and finally settled by binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration and
Conciliation of the International Chamber of Commerce then in force.

For the purposes of appointing the arbitration panel, all of the Sellers and
the Members of the Mosiewicz Family shall be considered as a single Party and
shall be entitled to collectively appoint only one arbitrator hereunder.

The panel of arbitrators will be composed of three members to be appointed as
follows: each Party shall appoint one arbitrator; the two arbitrators
appointed by the Parties will then appoint a third arbitrator who shall chair
the panel. In case (i) the third arbitrator is not appointed within 30 (thirty) days of the
appointment of the latter of the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties or
(ii) either one of the Parties fails to appoint its own arbitrator within 15
(fifteen) days of the notice of the appointment of the other Party's
arbitrator, then the third arbitrator and/or the arbitrator not appointed by
either one of the Parties will be appointed by the ICC Court of Arbitration at
the request of either Party. Each of the arbitrators shall be (x) an
experienced arbitrator of disputes arising out of large, complex commercial
transactions; (y) an Italy qualified lawyer who is fluent in English; and (z)
unaffiliated, and without prior or current financial affiliations, with either
Party.

The arbitrators shall resolve the dispute pursuant to the substantive Laws of
Italy, without regard to their conflict of laws rules. The venue of the
arbitration shall be Paris (France) and the arbitration proceedings shall be
conducted in English, in which regard all arbitrators shall be fluent in the
English language.

Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the arbitration proceedings. In the award, the arbitrators shall finally
allocate the arbitration fees, costs and expenses between the Parties.

The award, in which the arbitrators will be required to state the factual and
legal basis for their decision, will be final and binding to the Parties and
not subject to appeal or judicial review.

The Parties reserve the right to seek provisional or conservatory measures and
injunctive relief from courts of competent jurisdiction in connection with
matters submitted to arbitration pursuant hereto.

| 
---|--- 

14.3

|

Jurisdiction 

Without prejudice to the foregoing, each of the Parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Milan (Italy) in connection with those
Proceedings relating to this Agreement which, due to their nature, cannot be
the subject of arbitration under the Laws of Italy.
