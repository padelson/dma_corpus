Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Shareholders' Representative, as
the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company,
its Subsidiaries or the Shareholders' Representative, they shall be paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Entity, and such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Shareholders' Representative, as the case may
be.

  


 

  

3.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

(b) Parent shall provide to the Shareholders' Representative such back-up or
supporting data or materials relating to the preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement as the Shareholders' Representative may reasonably request. Parent
shall provide, and cause the Company to provide, the Shareholders'
Representative and its Representatives with reasonable access to the Company's
auditors and accounting and other personnel and to the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any other document or information under
its control that is reasonably requested by the Shareholders' Representative
(including the workpapers of the Company's auditors) for all purposes of this
_Section 3.4_ , including in order to allow the Shareholders' Representative
and its Representatives to prepare the Notice of Objection and participate in
the resolution of any items set forth in a Notice of Objection, subject in
each case to reasonable confidentiality restrictions, and other agreements
customarily required in such circumstances, and, in each case upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The
Shareholders' Representative shall furnish to Parent and its

  

  

 

14  

  

  

Representatives such workpapers (including the workpapers of any accountant or
auditor retained by the Shareholders' Representative in connection with this
_Section 3.4_ ) or other documents or information under its control that is
reasonably requested by Parent for purposes of reviewing any Notice of
Objection and participating in the resolution of any items set forth in any
Notice of Objection.

  


 

  

(c) If the Shareholders' Representative has any objections to the Post-Closing
Statement or any of the amounts set forth therein, it shall deliver to Parent
a written statement (a " _Notice of Objection_ ") describing its objections in
detail and providing reasonable supporting detail with respect to any
objections set forth therein not later than forty-five (45) days after its
receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (such forty-five (45) day period, the "
_Acceptance Period_ "). If the Shareholders' Representative fails to deliver a
Notice of Objection within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing Statement
and the amounts set forth therein shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Shareholders' Representative and shall be binding upon all of the parties to
this Agreement for all purposes hereof. Any items set forth in the Post-
Closing Statement that are not objected to by the Shareholders' Representative
in a Notice of Objection during the Acceptance Period shall be deemed to have
been accepted and shall be binding upon all of the parties to the Agreement
for purposes hereof. If the Shareholders' Representative delivers a Notice of
Objection to Parent within the Acceptance Period, the Shareholders'
Representative and Parent shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the
Shareholders' Representative's objections within the thirty (30) day period
following the delivery of the Notice of Objection. Within fourteen (14) days
of delivery by the Shareholders' Representative of the Notice of Objection
(or, if there is no timely Notice of Objection, after the expiration of the
Acceptance Period), if the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account
exceeds the aggregate amount disputed in the Notice of Objection, Parent and
Shareholders' Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account an
amount equal to such excess to each Shareholder of its Fully Diluted Pro Rata
Portion of such amount, in accordance with the Allocation Annex.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that a written agreement resolving all of the Shareholders'
Representative's objections has not been reached within the thirty (30) day
period (or such longer period as may be agreed by Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative) after the delivery of a Notice of Objection, the resolution of
all unresolved items (" _Disputed Items_ ") shall be submitted to KPMG LLP
(the " _Arbitrator_ ") and the following procedures will apply:

  


 

  

(i) The Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to render a decision in accordance
with this _Section 3.4(d)_ along with a statement of reasons therefor within
thirty (30) days of the submission of the Disputed Items, or a reasonable time
thereafter, to the Arbitrator. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final
and binding upon each party hereto and the decision of the Arbitrator shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

  


 

  

(ii) In the event the Shareholders' Representative and Parent submit any
Disputed Items to the Arbitrator for resolution, the Shareholders'
Representative and Parent shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this _Section 3.4(d)_. The Shareholders' Representative shall be
responsible for that fraction of the fees and costs of the

  

  

 

15  

  

  

Arbitrator equal to (1) the absolute value of the difference between the
Shareholders' Representative's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed
Items and the Arbitrator's final determination with respect to the Disputed
Items over (2) the absolute value of the difference between the Shareholders'
Representative's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Items and
Parent's aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Items, and Parent
shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs.

  


 

  

(iii) The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the
provisions of this _Section 3.4(d)_ , only (x) whether the Post-Closing
Statement was prepared in accordance with this Agreement with respect to any
Disputed Items and (y) whether there were mathematical errors in the Post-
Closing Statement with respect to any Disputed Items. Any disputes regarding
the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Arbitrator pursuant to this
_Section 3.4(d)_ shall not be resolved by the Arbitrator but rather shall be
resolved in accordance with _Section 11.12_. The arbitration shall have its
seat in New York, shall take place in New York City and shall be governed by
the rules of the American Arbitration Association to the extent not
inconsistent with this _Section 3.4_. The determination of each amount of the
Disputed Items shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 3.4(d)_ and, in any event, shall be no less than the lesser of the
amount claimed by either Parent or the Shareholders' Representative, and shall
be no greater than the greater of the amount claimed by either Parent or the
Shareholders' Representative.

  


 

  

(e) If, following the final determination procedures set forth in _Sections
3.4(c)_ and _(d)_ :

(B) Parent shall pay an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount to each
Shareholder of its Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of such amount, in
accordance with the Allocation Annex.

  


 

  

(ii) the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account all of
the funds contained therein as follows:

  

  

 

16  

  

  

(A) to Parent, an amount equal to the lesser of: (x) the balance of the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, or (y) the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount; and

  


 

  

(B) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the balance of
the Purchase Price Escrow Account;

  


 

  

    | i. |  

to the Shareholders' Representative, any amount thereof specified by the
Shareholders' Representative to be added to the Reserve; and

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    | ii. |  

the remaining amount to each Shareholder of its Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion
of such amount, in accordance with the Allocation Annex;

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

(iii) the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds the balance of the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, Parent shall be entitled to indemnification
from the Shareholders pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(iii)_ for the amount of

benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to
ERISA and whether or not maintained in the United States or another
jurisdiction, (II) any severance or other termination, bonus, retention or

applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the trustee of any Company Benefit Plan are in compliance
with all applicable Laws relating to the establishment, operation and
administration of each Company Benefit Plan, except where noncompliance would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending claims or claims
threatened in writing (other than routine claims for benefits), proceedings,
disputes, complaints or investigations by, on behalf of or against any Company
Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto, except where such claims,
proceedings, disputes, complaints or investigations would not, individually or

Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan that is

  

  

 

32  

  

  

intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter as to such qualification from
the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS and,

events that have occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss
of any such qualification status of any such Company Benefit Plan.

ERISA Affiliates maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or has in the last six

ERISA, including any "multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or any "multiple employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4063 or

United States, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
amounts required to be paid with respect to such Company Benefit Plan
(including employer and employee contributions, insurance premiums, levies,
debts, Taxes and expenses, whether required by Law or by the terms of such
Company Benefit Plan) have been made or, if applicable, accrued in accordance
with normal accounting practices, and (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

  


 

  

(f) Except with respect to payments contemplated pursuant to _ARTICLE 3_ of
this Agreement or as set forth on _Section 4.19(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or
in conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment
on or following the Closing Date) shall not (i) result in any contractual or
legal obligation on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay,
or to fund the payment of, any material severance, sale award, change of
control or other compensation or benefits to any Company Personnel, or any
other persons, (ii) materially increase, or accelerate the time of vesting of,
any compensation or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) give rise
to any payment of any amount by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that

any breach or violation of or default under, or limit any right to materially
amend, modify or terminate, any Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide, and no Company Benefit
Plan provides any individual with the right to, a gross-up, indemnification,
reimbursement or other payment for any excise or additional Taxes, interest or
penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code or due
to the failure of any payment to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) properly deductible by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-
Closing Straddle Period (the " _Transaction Tax Deductions_ ").

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,

  


 

  

(i) each Shareholder's aggregate liability pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ for

be entitled to any refund or credit to the extent such refund or credit is
attributable to a carryback of an item that is attributable to any taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date; (ii) the
Shareholders shall be entitled to a credit when and only to the extent the
credit actually reduces the unindemnified Tax liability of Parent and its

46  

  

  

which the Shareholders would otherwise be entitled under this _Section 7.2(d)_

Parent Indemnified Parties has been indemnified under this Agreement. If (x)
any such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or (y) Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequently pays any Taxes described in _Section 7.2(b)_ for
which none of the Parent Indemnified Parties is indemnified under this

and status of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other information
required to be shown therein consistent with past practice, except as

each such Tax Return to the Shareholders' Representative for its review and
comment not later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the deadline for
filing each such Tax Return, and shall make all changes to each such Tax
Return reasonably requested by the Shareholders' Representative.

  


 

  

(g) The amount of Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be
determined (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as
property Taxes), on a daily pro rata basis and (ii) in the case of other
Taxes, based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (and, in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership
of an equity interest in a partnership, other "flow-through" entity or
"controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the
Code or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law), as if the
taxable period of such entity ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date); _provided_ , that such Tax liability shall be determined by taking into
account Transaction Tax Deductions that would be properly deductible in a Pre-

  

  

 

47  

  

  

Closing Straddle Period if such Pre-Closing Straddle Period were an actual
taxable period that ended on (and included) the Closing Date (assuming, for
this purpose, that the safe harbor election provided for in IRS Revenue
Procedure 2011-29 is made with respect to any Transaction Tax Deduction that
constitutes a "success-based fee".

make or change any Tax election relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, for any taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning on or prior to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(i) Each of Parent, the Company, the Shareholders' Representative and their
affiliates will provide the other parties with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of
any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, any
judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, or any
other claim under this Agreement relating to Tax, and each will retain and
provide the others with any records or information that may be relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or claim. Such assistance
shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder and shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns and
supporting work schedules. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall
reimburse the other parties for reasonable third-party out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in providing such assistance. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall retain, and shall cause the Company to retain until
the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have
expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules, and other
records or information that may be relevant to such returns for all taxable
periods beginning on or before the Closing.

its terms) or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior approval
of the other parties hereto, except as may be required (a) to obtain the
consents and approvals, and to provide such notices, necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) by Law or stock
exchange rules applicable to Parent, the Company, the Shareholders or any of
their respective affiliates (and only to the extent so required), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in such event the parties hereto shall, if reasonably
practicable and permitted by applicable Law, consult with each other regarding
the content thereof and shall consider in good faith any redactions or
revisions reasonably requested by the other party. Each party hereto

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon reasonable prior written notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and confidentiality
obligations applicable to information furnished to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' possession from time to time (it being agreed that the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which such Laws or
confidentiality obligations apply), the Company shall, and shall cause each of
the Company's Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives of Parent, during
normal business hours and in a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with
the normal operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during the period
prior to the Closing Date, reasonable access to the Company's and each of its
Subsidiaries' properties, assets, books, Contracts and records, and to their
officers, accountants, counsel and other Representatives and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available
to Parent such information concerning their businesses, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) Parent shall not perform, or request or cause to be performed,
intrusive soil or groundwater sampling at any property of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) such right shall not apply to information subject to an
attorney-client privilege (to the extent disclosure would jeopardize such
privilege) and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries need not supply any
information which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is under a contractual or legal obligation not to supply;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at Parent's reasonable request, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek the consent of any party
whose consent is required to remove any contractual restriction on disclosure
to Parent. The Company shall have the right to have one or more of its
Representatives present at all times during any such reviews, examinations or
discussions. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent
shall not, and Parent shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any
customers, suppliers or competitors of the Company or its Subsidiaries
regarding the business, operations or prospects of the Company or regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , however,
that the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to develop and
implement a customer and supplier communication plan relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, (i) any information provided to or obtained by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ or any other provision of this Agreement
will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and shall be held by Parent
in accordance with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (ii) Parent agrees to be bound by

  

  

 

49  

  

  

and comply with the provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement as
if such provisions were set forth herein, which provisions are hereby
incorporated herein by reference.

  


 

  

(c) From and after the Closing, for any reasonable business purpose relating
to the Shareholders' ownership of the capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, including preparation of governmental or regulatory
reporting obligations, for a period of seven (7) years (or such longer period
as may be required by applicable Laws) after the Closing, (i) Parent shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to retain the books and records
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods prior to
the Closing in accordance with Parent's customary internal document retention
practices, and (ii) upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and confidentiality obligations
applicable to information furnished to Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries by third parties that may be in any of their
possession from time to time (it being agreed that Parent shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to make reasonable and appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which such Laws or
confidentiality obligations apply), Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company's Subsidiaries to, afford to the Shareholders and
their respective Representatives, during normal business hours following the
Closing Date, and in a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, reasonable
access to the Company's and each of its Subsidiaries' properties, books,
Contracts and records, and to their officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other Representatives and, during such period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the Shareholders all
information concerning their businesses, properties and personnel as they may
reasonably request for the purposes described above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) such right shall not apply to information subject to an attorney-
client privilege (to the extent disclosure would jeopardize such privilege),
(y) this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall not apply to Tax Returns and related
information which shall be governed by _Section 7.2(g)_ and (z) Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries need not supply any information which, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, is under a contractual or legal obligation not to supply;
provided however that at the reasonable request of the Shareholder
Representative, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
seek the consent of any party whose consent is required to remove any
contractual restriction on disclosure to the Shareholders. Parent shall have
the right to have one or more of its Representatives present at all times
during any such reviews, examinations or discussions.

  


 

  

(d) For a period of five years following the Closing Date (and, in the case of
books and records of the Company or any Subsidiary provided or otherwise made
available to any Shareholder or any of its Representatives following the
Closing Date pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, a period of five
years following the date such books and records are provided or otherwise made
available), each Shareholder shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates to,
(i) treat all confidential information relating to the Company and the
Subsidiaries as confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof, and not
use or disclose to any Person such confidential information and (ii) cause its
Representatives who have had access to such information to keep it
confidential and not to use or disclose to any Person any such information,
unless such information (A) is or becomes publicly available or is now or
hereafter disclosed in a manner making it publicly available, in each case
through no act or omission in violation hereof of such Shareholder or its
affiliates or Representatives, or (B) is required by applicable Law;

  

  

 

50  

  

  

 _provided_ that, with respect to Trade Secrets of the Company or any
Subsidiary, the foregoing covenant shall survive indefinitely. If the
disclosure of such information is required by applicable Law, such Shareholder
shall cooperate with and, to the extent reasonably practicable and not
prohibited by Law, provide Parent an opportunity to object to the disclosure
and shall give Parent as much prior written notice as is reasonably
practicable under the circumstances. If requested by Parent, such Shareholder
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at Parent's expense, to obtain
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such
information required by applicable Law to be disclosed.

  


 

  

7.5 _Consents; Further Assurances_.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto, shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements that may be imposed on such parties or their Subsidiaries with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including making all legally
required filings) and, subject to the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 8_ , to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and
(ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) as promptly
as practicable any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by them or any of their respective affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval. In
connection therewith, each of the parties shall, and shall cause their
respective affiliates to provide, such information and communications to
Governmental Entities as such Governmental Entities may request.

  


 

  

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent on the one hand, and the
Company on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file as soon as
practicable, but in all cases, within ten (10) Business Days following the
date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "). Each
of Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall (x) respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional information or
documentation received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity, and (y) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Parent shall offer to take (and if such
offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps which it is capable of taking to
avoid or eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted
by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement and, in any event, prior to the Outside Date, and shall defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party,
including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or otherwise
offer to take or

  

  

 

51  

  

  

offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the
offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that any such
action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing subsection (a), in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall, at its sole
cost and expense, comply with any requirements of ISRA and, in furtherance of
the foregoing, the Company shall (i) within five (5) Business Days after
execution of this Agreement, make any required filings or notifications (such
as a General Information Notice, as defined under ISRA) to the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (" _NJDEP_ "), (ii) promptly retain a
Licensed Site Remediation Professional (as defined under ISRA) at Ramboll
Environ, Inc. or other technical environmental consulting firm reasonably
acceptable to Parent to conduct any required Preliminary Assessment (as
defined under ISRA) and such other investigation as may be required by ISRA,
and (iii) prior to Closing, for any property subject to ISRA, submit to NJDEP,
prior to Closing, a Remediation Certification (as defined under ISRA) or such
authorization as may be required by N.J.A.C. § 7:26B-1.8 and take such other
commercially reasonable steps required to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity, for five (5) Business Days or such
shorter time period as may be required, to review and comment on any draft
reports prepared, issued or any other proposed ISRA forms or submissions prior
to any submission to or filing with the NJDEP made in furtherance of this
_Section 7.5(c)_.

  


 

  

(d) Each of the parties shall promptly furnish to the other copies of any
notices or written communications, and a written summary of any oral
communications, in each case received by such party or any of its affiliates
from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party shall permit
counsel to the other party an opportunity to review in advance, and shall
consider in good faith the views of such counsel in connection with, any
proposed written communications (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
filings and/or notices) by any other party or its affiliates to any third
party or any Governmental Entity, including the FTC and the Antitrust
Division, concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
party agrees to provide the other parties and its counsel the opportunity, on
reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or
discussions, either in Person or by telephone, between such party and/or any
of its affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any third party or
Governmental Entity, including the FTC and the Antitrust Division, on the
other hand, concerning or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  


 

  

(e) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (including
_Section 7.5(b)_), in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to bear any
expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining
any consents, authorizations or

  

  

 

52  

  

  

approvals required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to bear any such
expense or pay any such fee or grant any such concession without Parent's
prior written consent.

  


 

  

7.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance; Company Release_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the provisions of the
constituent documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries concerning the
elimination of liability and indemnification of directors and/or other Persons
shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Person that is as of the date hereof or the Closing covered
as an indemnitee under any such elimination of liability or indemnification
provisions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at
or after the Closing Date) is made against any directors and/or other Persons
entitled to indemnification under such constituent documents on or prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this _Section
7.6(a)_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6(a)_.

  


 

  

(b) Effective upon the Closing, except for claims of, or causes of action
arising from Fraud, Parent and the Company, and each of their respective
affiliates, successors and assigns (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the Closing)
(collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), shall be deemed to have remised,
released and forever discharged the officers and directors of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") of and
from any and all claims which the Releasing Parties, or any of them, now have,
ever had, or at the Closing may have, or hereafter can, shall or may have,
against the Released Parties in their capacities as officers and directors of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, or any of them, for, upon or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that such release shall not
cover claims or liabilities for amounts owed pursuant to, or other rights set
forth in, or other claims arising in connection with this Agreement or any
agreement ancillary to this Agreement or any of the Contracts set forth in
Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.. As of the Closing Date,
Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties, expressly acknowledges
that it has had, or has had and waived, the opportunity to be advised by
independent legal counsel.

  


 

  

(c) Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties, hereby represents,
warrants and covenants to each Released Party that there has not been and will
not be any assignment or other transfer of any right or interest in any claims
that any Releasing Party ever had, has or may have against the Released
Parties, and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each Released Party harmless
from any claims and Losses directly or indirectly incurred by any of the
Released Parties as a result of any Person asserting any right or interest
pursuant to any such purported assignment or transfer of any such right or
interest.

  

  

 

53  

  

  

(d) Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties, hereby agrees that if
any Releasing Party hereafter commences, joins in or in any manner seeks
relief through any suit arising out of, based upon or relating to any of the
claims released hereunder, or in any manner asserts against any Released Party
any of the claims released hereunder, then such Releasing Parties will pay to
such Released Party, in addition to any other Losses, direct or indirect, all
attorneys' fees incurred in defending or otherwise responding to such suit or
claims.

  


 

  

(e) Prior to 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Company shall procure, with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, six (6) year pre-
paid "tail" policies (the " _D andO Insurance_"), covering all present and
former officers and directors of the Company and those present and former
officers, directors and managers of its Subsidiaries who are currently covered
by directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, on terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policies
in effect on the date hereof. To the extent not fully paid prior to 12:01 a.m.
on the Closing Date, the aggregate premium and costs relating to the
procurement by the Company of the DandO Insurance shall be a Company Transaction
Expense.

  


 

  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person released or entitled to a
benefit hereunder, and each such person's heirs, representatives, successors
and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_. The Company shall not (and Parent shall
cause the Company not to) amend the provisions of this _Section 7.6_ in a
manner that would adversely affect any such third-party beneficiary without
the prior written consent of such third-party beneficiary. With respect to any
claim by a third-party beneficiary under this _Section 7.6_, no Releasing
Party may assert by way of defense, set-off or counterclaim, any claim
against, or Losses owing by, the Shareholders or any other third-party
beneficiary.

  


 

  

(g) The Company shall (and Parent shall cause the Company to), from time to
time following the Closing, execute and deliver such other documents and
instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by any
Released Party to implement the provisions of this _Section 7.6_.

  


 

  

7.7 _Shareholder Release_.

  


 

  

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each Shareholder, solely in such Person's
capacity as a Shareholder, on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Shareholder Releasing Parties_
"), shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of the officers and directors of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Shareholder
Released Parties_ ") of and from any and all claims which the Shareholder
Releasing Parties, or any of them, now have, ever had, or at the Closing may
have, or hereafter can, shall or may have, against the Shareholder Released
Parties, or any of them, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever, from the beginning of time through the Closing Date, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such release shall not cover claims or liabilities for
amounts owed pursuant to, or other rights set forth in, or other claims
arising in connection with this Agreement or any agreement ancillary to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such release shall not remise, release
or discharge any claim or right of such Shareholder Releasing Party under any
Contract with any Shareholder

  

  

 

54  

  

  

Released Party or any claim or right to indemnification by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for service by such Shareholder Releasing Party as an officer,
director, employee, agent or similar capacity of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any related enterprise. As of the Closing Date, each
Shareholder, on behalf of each of the applicable Shareholder Releasing
Parties, expressly acknowledges that it has had, or has had and waived, the
opportunity to be advised by independent legal counsel.

  


 

  

(b) Each Shareholder, on behalf of each of the applicable Shareholder
Releasing Parties, hereby represents, warrants and covenants to each
Shareholder Released Party that there has not been and will not be any
assignment or other transfer of any right or interest in any claims that any
Shareholder Releasing Party ever had, has or may have against the Shareholder
Released Parties, and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each Shareholder
Released Party harmless from any claims and Losses directly or indirectly
incurred by any of the Shareholder Released Parties as a result of any Person
asserting any right or interest pursuant to any such purported assignment or
transfer of any such right or interest.

  


 

  

(c) Each Shareholder, on behalf of each of the applicable Shareholder
Releasing Parties, hereby agrees that if any Shareholder Releasing Party
hereafter commences, joins in or in any manner seeks relief through any suit
arising out of, based upon or relating to any of the claims released
hereunder, or in any manner asserts against any Shareholder Released Party any
of the claims released hereunder, then such Shareholder Releasing Parties will
pay to such Shareholder Released Party, in addition to any other Losses,
direct or indirect, all attorneys' fees incurred in defending or otherwise
responding to such suit or claims.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person released or entitled to a
benefit hereunder, and each such person's heirs, representatives, successors
and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.7_. This _Section 7.7_ shall not be amended
in a manner that would adversely affect any such third-party beneficiary
without the prior written consent of such third-party beneficiary. With
respect to any claim by a third-party beneficiary under this _Section 7.7_, no
Shareholder Releasing Party may assert by way of defense, set-off or
counterclaim, any claim against, or Losses owing by, Parent or any other
third-party beneficiary.

  


 

  

(e) Each Shareholder shall, from time to time following the Closing, execute
and deliver such other documents and instruments and take such other actions
as may be reasonably requested by any Shareholder Released Party to implement
the provisions of this _Section 7.7_.

  


 

  

7.8 _R andW Insurance_. Parent shall cause the RandW Insurance to explicitly
provide that the provider of the RandW Insurance will not have the right to, and
will not, pursue any subrogation or contribution rights or any other claims
against the Shareholders in connection with any claim made by the Parent
Indemnified Parties thereunder, except in the case of claims of, or causes of
action arising from, Fraud. The cost of the RandW Insurance and any fees, costs
or deductibles associated therewith shall be borne solely by Parent. Parent
shall not amend, modify or terminate the RandW Insurance or any provisions
thereof in any manner that may adversely affect in any material respect the
Shareholders, including any amendment,

  

  

 

55  

  

  

modification or termination of the provisions of the RandW Insurance in respect
of the restriction described in the preceding sentence.

  


 

  

7.9 _280G Vote_. Prior to the Closing, to the extent the right of any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
with respect to the Company (each, a " _Disqualified Individual_ ") to receive
any payments would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and any regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Company shall take all necessary actions (including obtaining
any required waivers or consents from any Disqualified Individual to waive
such Disqualified Individual's right to the portion of such payment that would
constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) to submit such payments to a vote meeting the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall forward to Parent prior to
submission copies of all documents prepared by the Company in connection with
this _Section 7.9_ and shall incorporate any reasonable comments that are made
by Parent.

  


 

  

7.10 _Exclusive Dealing_.

  


 

  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company and each Shareholder shall not, and shall instruct its
Representatives not to, and the Company shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: (i) knowingly solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage with respect to any inquiries or the making of any proposal
from a Person or group of Persons other than Parent and its affiliates and
Representatives that may constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Alternative Transaction; (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person or group of Persons other than
Parent and its affiliates and Representatives regarding, or otherwise pursue,
an Alternative Transaction; (iii) furnish any non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets or
businesses, or afford access to the assets, business, properties, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or group of
Persons other than Parent and its affiliates and Representatives, in all cases
for the purpose of assisting with or facilitating an Alternative Transaction;
or (iv) enter into an Alternative Transaction or any Contract, including any
letter of intent, term sheet or other similar document, relating to an
Alternative Transaction. The Company shall cease all discussions and
negotiations concerning an Alternative Transaction. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent in writing of any proposed Alternative Transaction or any
inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Transaction and keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
of the status and details of such proposal or inquiry.

  


 

  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 7.10_ , an "Alternative Transaction" is any
(i) direct or indirect acquisition by any Person or group of Persons other
than Parent or its affiliates of assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any equity interests of any of its Subsidiaries) equal

or indirect acquisition by any Person or

  

  

 

56  

  

  

group of Persons other than Parent or its affiliates of any of the capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) merger,
consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person or group of
Persons other than Parent or its affiliates would own ten percent (10%) or
more of the consolidated assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  


 

  

7.11 _Restrictive Covenant_.

  


 

  

(a) For two years following the Closing Date, each Shareholder (other than the
ESOP) hereby agrees that it will not (i) directly or indirectly solicit or
seek to induce or encourage any employee of the Company or any its
Subsidiaries to leave his or her employment or position with the Company, (ii)
hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt any past, present or
prospective relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective customers,
partners, distributors, resellers, suppliers or employees, on the other hand.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in clause (i) and
(ii) of this _Section 7.11(a)_ will not prohibit any Shareholder from (A)
general advertising of employment opportunities including in any newspaper,
trade journal or other publication or any Internet website posting, in each
case that is not specifically directed at employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (B) participating in any third-party hiring fair or similar
event open to the public or (C) soliciting, negotiating with, offering
employment to or employing any Person who left the employment of the Company
at least 90 days prior to the date that such Person is first solicited or
offered employment without any prior solicitation or encouragement by Parent
or its affiliates in violation of this _Section 7.11(a)_.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that any covenant contained in _Section 7.11(a)_ should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the time or other limitations permitted by any
applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to
reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time or other limitations permitted by such
applicable Law. The covenants and provisions contained in _Section 7.11(a)_
and each provision hereof are several and distinct covenants and provisions.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as
written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants
or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

  


 

  

7.12 _Continued Existence_. During the period from the Closing Date until the
later of the Indemnity Escrow Release Date and the Tax Escrow Release Date,
each Company Shareholder (other than the ESOP) shall (a) maintain its legal
existence in accordance with applicable Law and (b) maintain sufficient
capital to satisfy its obligations, including its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement, as they become due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, for
bona fide estate planning purposes, each Company Shareholder (other than the
ESOP) may transfer all or a portion of its assets to another Person provided
that the transferee (i) maintains sufficient capital to satisfy its
obligations, including its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, as they
become due and (ii) expressly assumes the obligations of such Company

  

  

 

57  

  

  

Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that no such
assumption shall relieve such Company Shareholder of its obligations
hereunder).

  


 

  

7.13 _ESOP Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all
reasonable actions necessary, in accordance with ERISA, the Code and the ESOP,
to adopt resolutions and amend the ESOP, effective in all respects as of the
Closing and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent to provide
that, effective upon the Closing Date, the ESOP no longer is an "employee
stock ownership plan" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code. At or
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt any other amendments to the
ESOP as are necessary to reflect and effect the Transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable requirements of the Code, ERISA and the ESOP and
provided that such amendments are in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent. Parent shall maintain the ESOP, as amended in
accordance with this subparagraph, or as merged into and made a part of a
differing defined contribution qualified retirement plan sponsored by the
Parent or an affiliate, until the later of the Indemnity Escrow Release Date
and the Tax Escrow Release Date. Furthermore, Parent shall amend the ESOP as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date to permit in-service
distributions from the ESOP in an amount equal to at least 50% of each ESOP
participant's account balance.

  


 

  

7.14 _Resignations_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent letters of
resignation effective as of the Closing from (a) each of the directors of the
Company and (b) each of the officers of the Company that Parent specifies in

which letters shall only apply to status as an officer or director but not as
an employee.

case such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being

and intentional breach" shall mean a material breach of any representation,

ARTICLE 10. 
  INDEMNIFICATION

  


 

  

10.1 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnitees._

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to this Article 10, each Shareholder
(other than the ESOP, for which indemnification will be provided solely from
the Indemnity Escrow Account) shall indemnify Parent, its affiliates and each
of their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, stockholders,
members, controlling Persons, agents, successors, permitted assignees, and
other Representatives (the " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") against, from and in
respect of, and hold it harmless from, and compensate and reimburse it for,
any Loss (other than a Loss which is indemnifiable under _Section 7.2(b)_ )
suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnitee arising from or in connection
with:

  


 

  

(i) any failure of any Company Fundamental Representation or any Shareholder
Fundamental Representation of such Shareholder to be true and correct as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except with
respect to representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular date, which representations and warranties need only be true and
correct as of such date);

  


 

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of such Shareholder or, prior to
the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained in this
Agreement, but excluding the covenant or agreement in _Section 7.5(c)_
regarding ISRA;

  


 

  

(iii) to the extent not paid to Parent from the Purchase Price Escrow Account,
the Adjustment Amount; and

  


 

  

(iv) any foreclosure upon, or exercise of rights by a Governmental Entity in
respect of, the estate tax Lien described in _Section 3.6(b)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_.

  


 

  

(b) The obligation to provide for indemnification under _Section 10.1(a)_ ,
other than with respect to the failure of a Shareholder Fundamental
Representation to be true and correct, shall be proportionate to such
Shareholder's Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of the applicable Losses (such
that the total amount of such indemnity is equal to 100% of the applicable
Losses). The obligation to provide indemnification in the case of the failure
of a Shareholder Fundamental Representation to be true and correct shall be
borne solely by the

  

  

 

62  

  

  

applicable Shareholder to whom such representation relates and the obligation
to provide indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)(iv)_ shall be borne
solely by the Shareholders holding the Common Stock subject to the estate tax
Lien described in Section _3.6(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. Each
Shareholder's obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1_
shall be several and not joint.

  


 

  

(c) Parent's sole and exclusive remedy for indemnification claims under
_Section 10.1(a)_ against the ESOP shall be to assert, otherwise in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, claims against the Indemnity Escrow Account
and the ESOP shall not otherwise have any indemnification obligation to any
Parent Indemnitee.

  


 

  

(d) Except in the case of Fraud and except with respect to any liability
pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iv), each Shareholder's aggregate liability
pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_ shall not exceed such Shareholder's Fully
Diluted Pro Rata Portion of $13,200,000.

  


 

  

10.2 _Indemnification by Parent_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify each Shareholder, its
affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, managers,
employees, stockholders, members, controlling Persons, agents, successors,
permitted assignees and other Representatives (the " _Shareholder Indemnitees_
") against, from and in respect of, and hold it harmless from, and compensate
and reimburse it for, any Loss suffered or incurred by such Shareholder
Indemnitee arising from or in connection with:

  


 

  

(i) any failure of (x) any Parent Fundamental Representation to be true and
correct as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except with respect to representations and warranties that address matters
only as of a particular date, which representations and warranties need only
be true and correct as of such date); or (y) any representation or warranty
contained in any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto to be true
and correct as of the date of delivery to the Company or the Shareholders;

  


 

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this
Agreement; and

  


 

  

(iii) failure to comply with any requirements of ISRA (as it may be amended
after the Closing) arising from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Except in the case of Fraud, Parent shall not be required to indemnify any
Shareholder Indemnitee and shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ for any amount in excess of $13,200,000.

  


 

  

10.3 _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification
is provided under this _ARTICLE 10_ shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered by the indemnified party (after giving effect to any applicable
deductible, retention, collection costs, retrospectively rated premiums and
increase in future premiums as a result of or incurred in connection with the
claim) under insurance policies (including the Representation and Warranty
Insurance) with respect to such Loss. Parent shall, and shall cause the other
Parent Indemnitees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek all
available recovery under all insurance policies

  

  

 

63  

  

  

covering any such Loss including but not limited to the RandW Insurance. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Parent Indemnitee
with respect to any Loss for which any such Parent Indemnitee has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund for such amount (after giving effect to
any applicable deductible, retention, collection costs, retrospectively rated
premiums and increase in future premiums as a result of or incurred in
connection with the claim) shall be promptly made to the applicable
indemnifying party. Parent waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses.

  


 

  

10.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify, hold
harmless, compensate and reimburse any person (i) pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)(i)_ or _10.2(a)(i)_ shall terminate when the applicable representation
or warranty terminates pursuant to _Section 11.1_, (ii) pursuant to _Section
10.1(a)(ii)_ or _10.2(a)(ii)_ shall terminate 60 days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (including all extensions thereof with
respect to such Contract or agreement), (iii) pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(iii)_ shall terminate 60 days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to any failure to comply with any requirements of ISRA
(as it may be amended after the Closing) arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) pursuant to the other clauses of
_Section 10.1_ shall not terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
obligations to indemnify, hold harmless, compensate and reimburse shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a
claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) pursuant to _Section 10.5_ to the party to be providing
the indemnification.

  


 

  

10.5 _Procedures_.

  


 

  

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a person (the " _indemnified party_ ")
to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 7.2_ ,
_10.1_ or _10.2_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by
any person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must notify Parent (if the indemnified party is a
Shareholder Indemnitee) and the Shareholders' Representative (if the
indemnified party is a Parent Indemnitee) (such party, the " _indemnifying
party representative_ ") in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third
Party Claim within 10 Business Days after receipt by such indemnified party of
written notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to _Sections 10.4_ and _11.1_ , failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced in any material
respect as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall
deliver to the indemnifying party representative copies of all written notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party
relating to the Third Party Claim.

  


 

  

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party representative, at its sole cost and expense, shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
counsel is reasonably objected to by the indemnified party on the basis of an
actual conflict with such indemnified party, the Indemnifying Party shall
thereafter assume the defense with counsel that does not have an actual
conflict with such indemnified party. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section the indemnifying party representative shall be

  

  

 

64  

  

  

entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with such counsel if
it gives notice of its intention to do so to such indemnified party within 30
days of the receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim required by _Section
10.5(a);_ _provided_ that, prior to assuming control of such defense, the
indemnifying party representative shall acknowledge that assuming that the
claims made are true it would have an indemnity obligation for any Loss
resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under _Section 7.2_ or this
_ARTICLE 10_ (it being understood that such acknowledgment would be based on
the facts known at the time it is made). The indemnifying party representative
shall not be entitled to assume or control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, and shall pay the fees and expenses of a single firm of principal
counsel retained by the indemnified party in connection therewith, if (x) the
indemnifying party representative does not deliver the acknowledgment
described in the immediately preceding sentence of this _Section 10.5(b)_
within 30 days of receipt of notice of the claim pursuant hereto; (y) the
claim arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; or (z) the indemnifying party representative has
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the claim. If the
indemnifying party representative assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party representative)
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party representative,
it being understood that the indemnifying party representative shall control
such defense. The indemnifying party representative shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of a single firm of principal counsel employed by the
indemnified party. If the indemnifying party representative chooses to defend
or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate
in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the indemnifying party representative's request) the
provision to the indemnifying party representative of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
indemnifying party representative assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying party representative's prior written consent. If the indemnifying
party representative assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a
Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party representative may recommend and
which (i) by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount
of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) expressly and
unconditionally releases the indemnified party completely in connection with
such Third Party Claim, (iii) does not impose any injunctive or other
equitable relief on the indemnified party and (iv) does not include any
admission or finding of any violation of applicable Law by or otherwise
expressly disparage the indemnified party.

  


 

  

(c) _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under _Section 10.1_ or _10.2_ that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party
representative. Subject to _Sections 10.4_ and _11.1_ , the failure by any
indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party representative shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such
indemnified party under _Section 10.1_ or _10.2_ , except to the extent that
the indemnifying party representative demonstrates that it has been actually
prejudiced in any material respect by such failure.

  

  

 

65  

  

  

10.6 _Release from Indemnity Escrow Account_. Upon resolution of any claim by
any Parent Indemnitee for indemnification claims pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_
that is properly claimed against the Indemnity Escrow Account (including any
Interim Outstanding Claims and Outstanding Claims), Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative shall promptly provide joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Account, as
applicable, (i) to Parent, an amount equal to the ESOP's Fully Diluted Pro
Rata Portion of the amount of such claim resolved in favor of the Parent
Indemnitee and (ii) to the extent such claim is resolved at or after the
Indemnity Escrow Release Date, to the ESOP, an amount equal to the ESOP's
Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of the amount of such claim resolved in favor
of the Shareholders. At such time as all Outstanding Claims have been
resolved, Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall promptly provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity
Escrow Account to the ESOP the remainder of the amounts in the Indemnity
Escrow Account.

  


 

  

10.7 _Release from Tax Return Escrow Account_. Upon resolution of any claim by
any Parent Indemnified Party for indemnification in accordance with _Section
7.2(b)_ and _(c)_ for Taxes shown as due and payable on any Pre-Closing Tax
Return that is properly claimed against the Tax Return Escrow Account
(including any Outstanding Tax Return Claims), Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative shall promptly provide joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent to release from the Tax Return Escrow Account, as applicable, (i) to
Parent, an amount equal to the ESOP's Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of the
amount of such claim resolved in favor of the Parent Indemnified Party and
(ii) to the extent such claim is resolved at or after the Tax Return Escrow
Release Date, to the ESOP, an amount equal to the ESOP's Fully Diluted Pro
Rata Portion of the amount of such claim resolved in favor of the
Shareholders. At such time as all Outstanding Tax Return Claims have been
resolved, Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall promptly provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release from the Tax Return
Escrow Account to the ESOP the remainder of the amounts in the Tax Return
Escrow Account, if any.

  


 

  

10.8 _Release from Tax Escrow Account_. Upon resolution of any claim by any
Parent Indemnified Party for indemnification in accordance with _Section
7.2(b)_ and _(c)_ for any Tax Return Excess or Taxes other than Taxes shown as
due and payable on any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is properly claimed against
the Tax Escrow Account (including any Outstanding Tax Claims), Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative shall promptly provide joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to release from the Tax Escrow Account, as applicable, (i)
to Parent, an amount equal to the ESOP's Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of the
amount of such claim resolved in favor of the Parent Indemnified Party and
(ii) to the extent such claim is resolved at or after the Tax Escrow Release
Date, to the ESOP, an amount equal to the ESOP's Fully Diluted Pro Rata
Portion of the amount of such claim resolved in favor of the Shareholders. At
such time as all Outstanding Tax Claims have been resolved, Parent and the
Shareholders' Representative shall promptly provide joint written instructions

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto. The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
hereto to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  


 

  

11.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which the parties hereto agree shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect as of the Closing, this Agreement (including
the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any other agreements
contemplated hereby, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies except as provided in
_Section 7.6(f)_, _Section 7.7(d)_ and _Section 11.16_.

  


 

  

11.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

  


 

  

11.7 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, each party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement by any other party or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party, or (c) waive
compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

  


 

  

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the agreements, instruments and
documents contemplated hereby shall be exclusively governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof.

  


 

  

11.9 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (in whole or in
part) by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void and of no effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, without the consent of any other
party, assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
Ashland Global Holdings Inc. or any of its

  

  

 

70  

  

  

Subsidiaries but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder. No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

11.10 _Shareholders ' Representative_.

  


 

  

(a) _Powers_. The Shareholders' Representative is hereby appointed as the
Shareholders' true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of
substitution and substitution, in the Shareholders' name, place and stead, in
all capacities regarding any matter under this Agreement or otherwise relating
to this Agreement, including for the purposes of: (i) making decisions with
respect to the determination of the calculations set forth in the Pre-Closing
Statement and Post-Closing Statement; (ii) entering into any settlement or
submitting any dispute relating to the Post-Closing Statement; (iii) taking
any action that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the
Shareholders' Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof; (iv) taking
any action that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the
Shareholders' Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with the
closing of the transactions hereunder, including to determine the amount of
the Reserve to be retained and the amount, timing and circumstances of any
distribution from the Reserve; (v) taking any and all actions that may be
necessary or desirable, as determined by the Shareholders' Representative, in
its sole discretion, in connection with any amendment to this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof; (vi) accepting notices on behalf of
Shareholders; (vii) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Shareholders,
any and all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by the
Shareholders, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (viii) making any payments or paying any expenses under or in
connection with this Agreement; (ix) granting any consent or approval on
behalf of the Shareholders or any of them; (x) entering into any settlement,
modifying any indemnification or reimbursement obligation, or instituting or
defending any litigation relating to any claim for Losses against the
Shareholders or any of them; and (xi) taking any and all actions and doing any
and all other things provided in, contemplated by or related to this Agreement
or the actions contemplated hereby to be performed on behalf of any
Shareholder. As the representative of the Shareholders, the Shareholders'
Representative shall act as the agent for each Shareholder and shall have
authority to bind each such Shareholder, and Parent may rely on such
appointment and authority until the receipt of notice of the appointment of a
successor upon two (2) Business Days' prior written notice by the existing
Shareholders' Representative to Parent. The grant of authority described
herein (i) is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable and survives the
death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Shareholder and (ii)
survives the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(b) _Reserve_. In order to cover expenses of the Shareholders' Representative
and potential obligations under _Section 3.3_ hereof, at Closing the
Shareholders' Representative shall establish a reserve (the " _Reserve_ ")
equal to the Reserve Amount with the funds paid by Parent to the Shareholders'
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_. The Reserve Amount shall be
increased or decreased based upon interest earned thereon and distributions
made therefrom, or other amounts received or held by the Shareholders'
Representative. The Reserve may be held or disbursed by the Shareholders'
Representative in its discretion to cover any such

  

  

 

71  

  

  

expenses or potential obligations which may arise in connection with this
Agreement for payment after the Closing Date. Each Shareholder shall be
entitled to its Fully Diluted Pro Rata Portion of any amount released from the
Reserve to the Shareholders, except to the extent that the Shareholders'
Representative shall have paid a disproportionate amount of any expenses or
obligations on behalf of any Shareholder. The retention of amounts by the
Shareholders' Representative shall not be evidence that the Company, the
Shareholders or Parent has breached any provision of this Agreement or that
any amount is due or owing hereunder.

  


 

  

(c) _Liability_. The Shareholders' Representative will not be liable to any
Shareholder for any act done or omitted under this Agreement as the
Shareholders' Representative while acting in good faith, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.

  


 

  

11.11 _Specific Performance; Enforcement_.

  


 

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of
this Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court identified in _Section 11.12_ , this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, which right shall
include the right of the Company to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or
order of specific performance shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in
addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity.

  


 

  

(b) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce
the obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent, the
Company may, for and on behalf of the Shareholders, seek and recover damages
(including damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Shareholders based on the consideration that would
have otherwise been payable to the Shareholders or otherwise) for any breach
of this Agreement by Parent, which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and
agreed to by Parent.

  


 

  

11.12 _Jurisdiction_.

  


 

  

(a) Each of the parties irrevocably (i) submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or in the event,
but only in the event, that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware)
for the purpose of any litigation directly or indirectly based upon, relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions

  

  

 

72  

  

  

contemplated hereby in any court other than the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware (or in the event, but only in the event, that such court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any litigation with respect to this Agreement, (x) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section 11.12(a)_, (y) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may
not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in
_Section 11.3_ and agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by personal delivery to the respective addresses set forth in
_Section 11.3_ shall be effective service of process for any litigation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing in this _Section 11.12(a)_ shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  


 

  

11.13 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY HERETO
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.13_.

  


 

  

11.14 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final and non-appealable Order to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein, so long as the economic and legal substance of the
transactions contemplated

  

  

 

73  

  

  

hereby are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

11.15 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company and the Shareholders set forth in this Agreement are made and given
subject to, and are qualified by, the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any
disclosure set forth in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to apply to and qualify the section of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section of this Agreement to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant
to such other section or subsection. The Company Disclosure Schedule may
include brief descriptions or summaries of certain agreements and instruments.
The descriptions or summaries do not purport to be comprehensive and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the documents
described. No disclosure set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating
to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed
as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such
information (a) is required by the terms of this Agreement to be disclosed,
(b) is material to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any other party, (c) has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or (d) is
outside the ordinary course of business. Matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature.

  


 

  

11.16 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, partners, officers,
employees and affiliates, that Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP may serve as
counsel to each and any Shareholder and its affiliates (individually and
collectively, and including the Shareholders' Representative, the "
_Shareholder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the Closing, Arnold and
Porter Kaye Scholer LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to each and
any member of the Shareholder Group or any director, partner, officer,
employee or affiliate of any member of the Shareholder Group, in connection
with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation and each of the parties hereto (including, but not limited
to, the Company) hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest
arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any affiliate thereof
to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation.
Parent agrees that, as to all communications among Arnold and Porter Kaye
Scholer LLP, the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Shareholders and their
respective affiliates and the Shareholders' Representative that relate in any
way to the

  

  

 

74  

  

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Shareholders and their
respective affiliates and/or the Shareholders' Representative, as applicable,
and may be controlled by the Shareholders and their respective affiliates
and/or the Shareholders' Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent or the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Parent or the Company or its
Subsidiaries and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP
to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not have
access to such confidential communications or waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Shareholders' Representative. This _Section
11.16_ is for the benefit of the Shareholder Group and such Persons are
intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.16_.

  


 

  

11.17 _No Obligation or Liability of Nonparties_. Except with respect to
claims of, or causes of action arising from Fraud, any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be
brought against Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. Except with
respect to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud or claims
brought against the Shareholders as parties to this Agreement, no former,
current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, members, managers, agents,
trustees, affiliates, general or limited partners or assignees of the Company,
the Shareholders, Parent, the Shareholders' Representative or of any former,
current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person,
shareholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, trustee, general or
limited partner, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing shall
have any liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, the
Shareholders or Parent under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit,
arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.
