as to wages and conditions of employment. There is (i)&nbsp;no strike or material labor dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and none have occurred
during the past 5 years, and (ii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of the Company, no union certification petition has been filed with respect to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been in material
