NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the LBCL and the DGCL, Acquisition
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as
hereinafter defined). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of Acquisition shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation under the name "OMNI Energy Services Corp." and shall
succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company and

of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time
on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions which by
their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York 10019-6064. As used in this Agreement " _Business Day_ " means any
day other than (a) Saturday or Sunday or (b) any other day on which banks in
the State of New York are permitted or required to be closed.

 

1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing certificates of merger (the "
_Certificates of Merger_ ") simultaneously with the Secretary of State of the
State of Louisiana as provided in the LBCL and the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
upon such filings or at such time thereafter as Parent, Acquisition and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificates of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_.

 

(a) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificates of Merger and the applicable provisions of the LBCL and the
DGCL.

(b) The directors of Acquisition and the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) The articles of incorporation and the by-laws of the Company, each as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of
incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until
thereafter amended in accordance with the LBCL and the applicable provisions
of such articles of incorporation and by-laws.

 



 

2 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES

 

OF THE COMPANY AND ACQUISITION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or Acquisition Common Stock (as hereinafter defined):

(a) _Common Stock of Acquisition_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Acquisition (the " _Acquisition Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock Owned by Parent or Acquisition_. Each share of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock that is owned by Parent or Acquisition or
any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries or held by the Company or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock (collectively,
the " _Excluded Shares_ "), including each Rollover Share (as hereinafter
defined), shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
Excluded Shares, Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) and Rollover
Shares shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive $2.75 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Pursuant to the
terms of the Rollover Agreement (as hereinafter defined), immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (i)(A) certain Rollover Shares that are Company Common
Stock shall be contributed to Parent in exchange for a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) having a dollar value equal
to the Merger Consideration that would have otherwise been payable in cash in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ in respect of such Rollover Shares had the
rollover not occurred and (B) certain Rollover Shares that are Company
Preferred Stock shall be contributed to Parent in exchange for a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock valued as though such Rollover Shares were
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
and paid the Merger Consideration in cash in accordance with _Section 2.2_,
such shares of Parent Common Stock in each case to have the same financial and
economic terms as the Parent Common Stock acquired by Affiliates of Parent
and (ii) certain Rollover Shares that are Company Preferred Stock shall be
contributed to a subsidiary of Parent to be formed prior to the Effective Time
(" _Intermediate Holdco_ ") in exchange for a number of shares of
Intermediate Preferred Stock (as hereinafter defined) valued as though such
Rollover Shares were converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time and paid the Merger Consideration in cash in accordance
with _Section 2.2_, such shares of Intermediate Preferred Stock to have the
financial and economic terms as set forth in the Rollover

 



 

3  Agreement. As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Rollover Shares_ " shall mean
the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as provided in
the Rollover Agreement; (ii) the " _Rollover Agreement_ " shall mean the
agreement entered into on the date hereof, by and among Parent, Brian Recatto,
Dennis Sciotto and Edward Colson; (iii) " _Parent Common Stock_ " shall mean
the shares of common stock of Parent; and (iv) " _Intermediate Preferred
Stock_ " shall mean the shares of convertible preferred stock of Intermediate
Holdco.

 

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who was
entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 12:131 of the LBCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be
converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 12:131 of
the LBCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive such consideration as determined pursuant to Section
12:131 of the LBCL); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right to appraisal and payment under the LBCL, each share of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.1(c)_, without any interest
thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
LBCL received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
settle, offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 

(e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares,
Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of certificates (" _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") representing any shares of Company Common Stock being
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares so represented, without interest thereon,
to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_.

 

(f) _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time,
solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock
distribution which in any such event is

 



 

4  made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Company Common Stock, there is a
change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, then the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of
such event.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, for use in the payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article II_, the aggregate Merger
Consideration for all shares of Company Common Stock to be converted pursuant
to _Section 2.1(c)_ (the aggregate of all such cash consideration being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation given on
the Closing Date, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger
Fund. The Merger Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person
(as hereinafter defined) who is a holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and whose shares are
being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and shall otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions
as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) containing instructions
for use by holders of Company Common Stock to effect the exchange of their
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided
herein. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of an
outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto (together with such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) and acceptance thereof by the Paying Agent (or, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer
agent of the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock on a book-entry
account statement), be entitled to an amount of cash (payable by check) equal
to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. The
Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If cash is to be remitted to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered for
exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the

 



 

5  Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed,
with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, at any time after
the Effective Time, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for the shares
represented thereby upon such surrender as contemplated by _Section 2.1_. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable as
Merger Consideration.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged for Cash_.
All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 2.2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.2_.

(d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation, and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to any applicable escheat,
abandoned property or similar Law and the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Merger
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the
Merger Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and 



 

6  withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock
and Warrants_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee administering the Stock Plans (as hereinafter defined) shall take
all actions necessary, and obtain all consents necessary, so that each
outstanding Company Stock Option (as hereinafter defined) heretofore granted
under any Stock Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable at
the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i)
the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. Reasonably
promptly after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments specified in this _Section
2.3(a)_ less any required withholding taxes as specified in _Section 2.3(d)_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee administering the Stock Plans shall take all actions necessary, and
obtain all consents necessary, so that all restrictions on each outstanding
share of Company Restricted Stock (as hereinafter defined) heretofore granted
under any Stock Plan shall lapse at the Effective Time and each such share of
Company Restricted Stock shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration. Reasonably promptly after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of shares of Company Restricted
Stock the cash payments specified in this _Section 2.3(b)_, less any required
withholding taxes as specified in _Section 2.3(d)_.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all actions necessary, and obtain all consents necessary, so that each
outstanding



 

7  Warrant (as hereinafter defined) shall be exercisable at the Effective Time,
to the extent not expiring prior thereto under their terms, and shall be
cancelled thereafter and shall evidence only the right to receive a cash
payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if
any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that would otherwise have been issuable under
such Warrants. Nothing in this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall give any rights in
respect of exercise or receipt of Merger Consideration in respect of any
Warrants that by their terms have expired prior to the Effective Time or been
previously exercised. Reasonably promptly after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the Persons entitled to payments under the
Warrants the cash payments specified in this _Section 2.3(c)_.

(d) Immediately following the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_, the Stock Plans and all award agreements thereunder shall
terminate, and the provisions in any other agreement, arrangement or benefit
plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of
the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company
shall be deleted or eliminated as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall
take such actions to ensure that as of the Effective Time no holder of a
Company Stock Option, Warrants, shares of Company Restricted Stock or any
participant in or a party to any Stock Plan or other agreement, arrangement or
benefit plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock, any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation or any other rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the cash payments specified in this _Section 2.3_. The Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ to any holder of Company
Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock or holder of Warrants (a " _Warrant
Holder_ ") such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock or Warrant
Holders, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

2.4 _Redemption of Company Preferred Stock_. 

(a) After the date hereof, the Company shall, in accordance with the Companys
articles of incorporation, deliver a notice, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to the holders of Series C 9% Convertible Preferred
Stock, a series of Company Preferred Stock (" _Series C Stock_ "), stating
that the Company will redeem each outstanding share of Series C Stock (other
than any Rollover Shares that are Series C Stock) for an amount in cash equal
to the Preferred Liquidation Value (as defined in the Companys articles of
incorporation), plus all accrued dividends thereon, whether or not declared
or due in respect thereof, immediately prior to the Effective Time as
determined in accordance with the Companys articles of incorporation.

 



 

8 (b) Immediately prior the Effective Time, the Company shall redeem
all outstanding shares of Series C Stock (other than any Rollover Shares that
are Series C Stock) and shall pay each holder of Series C Stock a redemption
payment in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.4(a)_ and the Companys
articles of incorporation.

licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership or
limited liability company and is in good standing to conduct business in each
jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation,
ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify
or be licensed has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company has heretofore made available to Parent and
Acquisition complete and correct copies of the articles or certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other equivalent organizational documents) of the

adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) a material adverse effect on the ability
of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that 



 

9  any adverse effect, fact, condition, event, development, change or state of
circumstance attributable to the following shall not constitute, and shall not
be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) conditions, events or circumstances
affecting either (x) the United States economy or the United States or world
financial, securities or credit markets generally or (y) the United States
oil and gas or oil and gas related industries generally, including the effect
thereon of offshore drilling and production accidents on offshore and coastal
oil and gas exploration and production activities, (2) the announcement or
pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby or market responses thereto
or loss or departure of employees, customers, suppliers or other business
relationships related thereto, (3) the effect of any change arising
in connection with any _force majeure_ event or "act of God", including,
without limitation, weather, natural disasters and earthquakes or hostilities,

terrorism or military actions, (4) any effect, event or change resulting from
a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition, (5) changes or proposed
changes in Laws that affect the United States oil and gas or oil and gas

restatement of the Companys historic financial statements on account of
accounting issues related to recording debt obligations incurred in connection
with acquisitions made by the Company as described on _Schedule 3.1(a)(ii)_

restatement may be deemed to constitute or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is reasonably likely to be a Company
Material Adverse Effect) and (8) the Companys possible breach of the Amended
and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 23, 2008 (as
amended), by and among Fifth Third Bank, the Company and the other signatories
thereto (the " _Loan Agreement_ ") as described on _Schedule 3.1(a)(iii)_ (it
being understood that (i) any effects of such breach and (ii) the facts giving
rise or contributing to such breach may each be deemed to constitute or be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or is reasonably
likely to be a Company Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _however_ , that
effects, facts, conditions, events, developments, changes or states of
circumstances set forth in clauses (1), (5) and (6) above may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or is a Company Material Adverse
Effect to the extent such effects, facts, conditions, events, developments,
changes or states of circumstances disproportionately impact the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries compared to other businesses in the same
industries; (ii) " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean, with respect to any party, any
Person (A) of which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a

other similar applicable Law as a result of any layoffs or other employment
terminations made by the Company and its Subsidiaries during such six-month
period prior to the Closing. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(v)_, as of

with (and, if accepted, negotiated with Parent for such Three Business Day
Negotiation Period), and shall have instructed the Company Representatives to
offer to negotiate with (and if accepted, negotiated with), Parent to attempt
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee would not,
after taking into account such adjustments, be required to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change; it being understood and agreed that, in the
case of clause (x) in paragraph (e) above, any amendment or modification to
the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice of Superior

Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer

Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure required by applicable Law

similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries

of circumstances, or any consequences thereof, becomes known to the Board of
Directors of the Company or the Special Committee prior to obtaining the

_Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_, the Company (and/or its Subsidiaries)

Parent (x) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, on the date of
termination of this Agreement or (y) in the case of clause (iii) above, on the
date of the entering into of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the
consummation of, as the case may be, a Subsequent Transaction. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall pay the Expenses to Parent in the event of

Committee has confirmed in writing to Parent that is has been withdrawn, (ii)
since the withdrawal of such Company Acquisition Proposal, there shall have
been no further negotiations with respect thereto between the Person or group
of Persons making such Company Acquisition Proposal (or such Persons or
groups representatives) and the Company (or any Company Representatives) and
no further delivery of confidential information by the Company (or any Company
Representatives) to such Person or group (or such Persons or groups
representatives) and (iii) the Company shall have requested that the Person or
group making such Company Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all
confidential information previously delivered to such Person or group (or
such Persons or groups representatives); _provided_ , that no Company
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered to have been "withdrawn" for purposes
of this _Section 5.3(b)_ if, within twelve months after the termination of
this Agreement, the Company (and/or any of its Subsidiaries) enter(s) into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummate(s), a Subsequent
Transaction with the Person or group of Persons who made such
Company Acquisition Proposal (or any affiliate thereof). As used in this
Agreement, " _material and willful breach_ " shall mean a material breach that
is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the
knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or
would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 

(c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ other
than pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(g)_ or
_Section 7.1(h)_ and at such time of termination (i) the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ shall have been satisfied as of the date
of termination, (ii) Parent has failed, or failed to cause Acquisition, to
consummate the Closing in breach of _Section 1.2_ and (iii) the proceeds of
the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are not available to Parent on the terms set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of termination (clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Specified Financing Failure Termination
Event_ "), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $4,310,378 (the
" _Financing Failure Termination Fee_ ") within five (5) Business Days after
such termination. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreement
contained in this _Section 5.3(c)_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, that without this agreement the parties hereto would not
have entered into this Agreement, and that any amount payable pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(c)_ does not constitute a penalty but shall constitute
liquidated damages to compensate the Company. Payment of the Financing Failure
Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against
Parent, Acquisition, the Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current and future affiliates, representatives, shareholders, members,
managers, partners, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Related
Parties_ ") following a Specified Financing Failure Termination Event. Upon
payment of the Financing Failure Termination Fee, none of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any of their affiliates shall have any rights or
claims against Parent, Acquisition, the Financing Sources or any of their
respective Related Parties relating to this Agreement, including under
_Section 8.2_, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, whether at Law or equity, in contract (including under the Limited
Guaranty),

 



 

51  in tort or otherwise, and none of Parent, Acquisition, the Financing Sources
or any of their respective Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Financing Failure Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(d) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ other
than pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(g)_ or
_Section 7.1(h)_ (x) as a result of Parents failure to comply in all
material respects with its obligations in _Section 5.14(a)_ and at such
time, the Company is not in breach in any material respect of any
representation and warranty, covenant or other agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and 
_Section 6.2_ shall have been satisfied as of the date of termination or (y)
(A) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2 _shall have
been satisfied as of the date of termination, (B) Parent has failed to
consummate the Closing in breach of _Section 1.2_ and (C) the proceeds of the
Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are available to Parent on the terms set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of termination (clauses (x)
and (y), collectively, the " _Specified Financing Breach Termination Events_
"), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $7,183,964 (the "
_Financing Breach Termination Fee_ ") within five (5) Business Days after such
termination. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreement
contained in this _Section 5.3(d)_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, that without this agreement the parties hereto would not
have entered into this Agreement, and that any amount payable pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(d)_ does not constitute a penalty but shall constitute
liquidated damages to compensate the Company. Unless the Company elects to
seek specific performance under _Section 8.2,_ to the extent available,
payment of the Financing Breach Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole
and exclusive remedy against Parent, Acquisition, the Financing Sources and
any of their respective Related Parties following a Specified Financing Breach
Termination Event. Upon payment of the Financing Breach Termination Fee, none
of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their affiliates shall
have any rights or claims against Parent, Acquisition, the Financing Sources
or any of their respective Related Parties relating to this Agreement,
including  _Section 8.2_ or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, whether at Law or equity, in contract (including under
the Limited Guaranty), in tort or otherwise, and none of Parent, Acquisition,
the Financing Sources or any of their respective Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation to the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any of their affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay the Financing Breach Termination Fee on more than one (1)
occasion.



 

52 5.4 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Fiduciary
Indemnities_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or such employee of the Company
or any subsidiary whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including arising out of or relating to the
Merger, the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, and any
action taken in connection therewith). Any Fiduciary Indemnities wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 5.4(a)_, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, but the failure so to notify shall not relieve
a party from any liability that it may have under this _Section 5.4(a)_,
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party. Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof.
If Parent or the Surviving Corporation does not assume the defense, the
Fiduciary Indemnities as a group may retain only one law firm to represent
them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the positions of any
two or more Fiduciary Indemnities. Fiduciary Indemnities will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent unless such consent has been
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall cause all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from or limitation of liability for acts and omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancements of expenses
relating thereto now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Existing Indemnities_ ") as provided in their respective charters and/or
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) or in any indemnification
agreement listed on _Schedule 5.4(b)_ to survive the Merger and, for a period
of six years from the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such Indemnities, unless an alteration or
modification of such documents is required by applicable Law or each
Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Existing Indemnities to the fullest extent required by
its articles of incorporation and/or by-laws existing as of the date hereof or
in any indemnification agreement listed on  _Schedule 5.4(b)_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) existing
officer and director

 



 

53  liability insurance, including without limitation, all Side A coverage
(directors and officers liability) of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in respect of coverage for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_") on terms no less advantageous in the
aggregate to such indemnified parties than such existing insurance (copies of
which policies have been made available to Parent and Acquisition). If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall be no breach
of this provision so long as the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms no
less advantageous in the aggregate to such indemnified parties than the
existing insurance; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement
by the Company to obtain such coverage (such 250%, the " _Maximum Premium_
"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be
obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall
maintain the most advantageous policies obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent that the
Maximum Premium is $861,675.

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, proper provisions shall be made so that such Person assumes
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.4_.

(e) This  _Section 5.4_, which shall survive the consummation of the Merger
at the Effective Time and shall continue for the periods specified herein, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Existing
Indemnities, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.4_
(whether or not parties to this Agreement).

5.5  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including 
_Section 5.7_ hereof in respect of actions taken as to antitrust matters,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable, under applicable Law or otherwise, to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of the

 



 

54  Company, the parties to this Agreement shall direct their respective
officers and directors to take all such necessary action.

 

5.6 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press release
announcing this Agreement. Parent and the Company will consult with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press release or other public
announcement (including to employees) pertaining to the Merger, any related
financing or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public announcement prior to such consultation and agreement, except
as may be required by applicable Law, in which case the party proposing to
issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other parties and
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such press release or
public announcement before issuing any such press release or making any such
public announcement.

 

5.7 _Consents and Approvals; State Takeover Laws_.

 

(a) Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall cooperate with one another in
(i) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto shall file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
" _Antitrust Division_ ") any notification required to be filed by it or its
"ultimate parent" company under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make such
filings promptly and to respond on a timely basis to any requests for
additional information made by either of such agencies. Each of the parties
hereto agrees to furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
it and its affiliates and their respective representatives, on the one hand,
and the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity or
members or their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the
Merger, other than personal financial information filed therewith.

(b) Each party hereto shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Acquisition or the Company or any of their
respective affiliates in connection with the Merger or the taking of any
other action contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time any consent,
approval or waiver from third parties necessary to allow the Company and its
Subsidiaries to continue operating their businesses as presently conducted as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

55 (c) Each party hereto agrees to furnish the other with such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party and its
affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entities, including any filings necessary under the provisions
of the HSR Act.

(d) The Company and its Board of Directors shall take all reasonable action
within its control necessary to ensure that no "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby. If any such statute or regulation becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company and the members of its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions to the extent permitted by Law so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Upon adoption of this Agreement by their respective stockholders, each of
Acquisition and the Company shall cause its respective officers to make the
acknowledgements and certifications required by Section 112D of the LBCL.

 

5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt written
notice to each other party (and, in the case of the Company, shall also
provide prompt written notice to the Financing Sources) of (a) any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) notice or communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event of which it becomes aware that has caused or
could reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality being or
becoming as of any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time untrue or inaccurate at such time in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified being or becoming as of
any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, (d) the failure of it to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any obligation to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement or (e) the commencement or threat of any
Company Litigation or any other Action which relates to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or the issuance of any Order
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, in either case which, if pending, threatened or issued,
as the case may be, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

5.9  _Continuation of Employee Benefits_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will honor in accordance with their terms all of the existing
employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements that are
set forth on _Schedule 5.9(a)_ between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any current or



 

56  former officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or group of such officers, directors, employees or
consultants.

 

(b) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation will not materially and adversely alter the benefits (including
health benefits, severance policies and general employment policies and
procedures) that are available to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the date hereof (other than modifications to any employee
benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and other than with respect to any issuance of equity or equity-based
compensation or provision of any post-retirement medical coverage or U.S.
qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plan coverage). Nothing in
this _Section 5.9(b)_ shall be deemed to prevent the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries from making any change required by applicable Law.

 

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries shall be given credit for all service with the Company or
its Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries)
prior to the Effective Time under all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in which they participate or in which they become participants
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, except in each case
to the extent this would result in duplication of benefit for the same
period. 

(d) This _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time and shall continue without limit except as expressly set forth
herein. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.9_ or any other provision of
this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
employee, former employee or independent contractor (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to continued employment for any
specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing herein shall (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the
Surviving Corporation to terminate any employee or independent contractor for
any reason, (ii) except as set forth in Section 5.9(b), require the
Surviving Corporation to continue any Plans, employee benefit plans or
arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Closing Date, or (iii) constitute an amendment to any Plan, employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

Company shall prepare in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Act
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the parties hereto shall prepare
in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Act and file with the SEC
the Schedule 13E-3. The parties will cooperate with each other in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3. The

efforts to have the Schedule 13E-3 cleared by the SEC as promptly as

from the SEC and (ii) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 or for additional information. The parties
hereto shall provide each other with reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3
(including each amendment or supplement to either) and all responses to
requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC
(provided that the Company shall (i) include in any such documents or
responses all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (ii) not file, mail
or otherwise deliver such document or respond to the SEC or the staff of the
SEC over Parents reasonable objection) prior to filing such with or sending
such to the SEC, and the parties hereto will provide each other with copies of
all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any party hereto
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
or the Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company
to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall, acting through its Board of Directors and in accordance
with applicable Law and the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Company, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (and, in no event later than 35 days after the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company) for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger and, subject
to _Section 5.2(d)_, shall take all lawful and commercially reasonable
action to solicit proxies in favor of approval of this Agreement and the
Merger. Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys
stockholders and shall include such recommendation, together with a copy of
this Agreement and the opinion referred to in _Section 3.1(n)_, in the Proxy
Statement. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its
terms pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company shall submit this Agreement to
its shareholders at the Special Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the
Company or the Special Committee shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified
its recommendation thereof or otherwise effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change or proposed or announced any intention to do so. If the Company
properly exercises its right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of  _Section 7.1(g)_, the Companys obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.10(b)_ shall terminate.



 

58 5.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt
notice of, and copies of all proceedings and correspondence relating to, any
Action against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense and settlement of any such Action, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

5.12 _Payoff Letters_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain customary payoff letters (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent from all financial institutions
and other Persons to which the Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ is outstanding, which Payoff
Letters shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs or other similar obligations related to such Indebtedness as
of the Closing Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and (ii) state that all Liens in
connection therewith relating to the assets, business or operations of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be, upon the payment of the
Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, automatically released by all lenders.

 

5.13 _Resignations_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent at the
Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation,
effective as of the Effective Time, of all directors of the Company and those
directors of any of its Subsidiaries designated by Parent to the Company in
writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all material terms, conditions,
representations and warranties applicable to Parent set forth in the
Commitment Letters that are within its control, (ii) maintain in effect the

Parent and not in violation of this _Section 5.14_ and (iv) subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ and conditions to
closing set forth in the Commitment Letters, consummate the Financings at
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if funds in the amounts and on the
terms set forth in the Commitment Letters become unavailable to Parent on the
terms and conditions set forth therein, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") to the extent available in amounts and otherwise on terms and
conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than as set forth in
the Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
breach of this covenant expand the Companys rights in connection with the
termination rights set forth in _Section 7.1_.

 

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers and employees to provide, all necessary cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition in connection with the
arrangement of, and the

 



 

59  negotiation of agreements with respect to, the Financings (including any
Alternative Financings), including (i) preparing and furnishing to Parent and
the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with the Debt Financing, including the parties to the

relating thereto (collectively, the " _Financing Sources_ "), as promptly as
practicable all information as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist
in the preparation of the definitive documentation evidencing the Financings,
(ii) by making available to Parent, Acquisition and the Financing Sources and

independent accountants to provide any reports, consents and comfort letters
reasonably requested in connection with the Financings (including any
Alternative Financings), (v) agreeing to enter into such agreements,
including underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents
and other definitive financing documents, and to use reasonable best efforts
to deliver such officers certificates, as are customary in financings of
such type, (vi) agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise
grant Liens on, the Companys assets pursuant to such agreements as may be
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, (vii) providing assistance in

any legal opinions and solvency opinions to be delivered in connection with

(including any Alternative Financings) as promptly as practicable and in any

Financings), the Company agrees, at the reasonable request of Parent, to call
for prepayment or redemption, or to repay, redeem and/or renegotiate, as the
case may be, any then existing Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries identified by Parent; _provided_ , that such call or any
agreement to repay, redeem, exercise and/or renegotiate may be rescinded if
the Merger is not completed on or prior to the effective date of any such
prepayment, repayment, redemption, exercise and/or renegotiation, as the case
may be; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to make 



 

60  any non-cancelable payments in connection with such actions. Nothing in this
_Section 5.14_ shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide any assistance with respect to the Financings to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the ongoing business or operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and Acquisition hereby agree and
acknowledge that the obtaining of the Financings (including any Alternative
Financings) is not a condition of Parent and Acquisition to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement but is subject to _Section
5.3(c)_, _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 8.2_. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, directors, officers,
employees, representatives and advisors from and against any and all
reasonable and documented losses, damages, claims, out-of-pocket costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any action
taken by them at the request of Parent or Acquisition pursuant to this
_Section 5.14_ or in connection with the arrangement of the Financings
(including any Alternative Financings) and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except to the extent that such losses, damages, claims,
costs or expenses, directly or indirectly, resulted from or arose out of the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or where such liability relates to any information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such
Financing (or any Alternative Financing). The Company consents to
the reasonable use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the arrangement of the Financings in a manner customary for such
financing transactions.

 

5.15 _Company Common Stock De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

5.16 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, except to the extent that Parent shall otherwise consent in
writing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to:

(a) prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on
or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable
Law; 

(b) consult with Parent with respect to all Post-Signing Returns and deliver
drafts of such Post-Signing Returns to Parent no later than ten Business Days
prior to the date on which such Post-Signing Returns are required to be filed;

 

(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-
Signing Returns that are so filed;

 



 

61 (d) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and
financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent with past
practice; and

 

(e) promptly notify Parent of any federal, state, local or foreign income or
franchise and any other Action pending or threatened against or with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter,
including Tax liabilities and refund claims, and not settle or compromise any
such Tax matter or Action without Parents prior written consent.

(ii) the Board

 



 

65  of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee shall have determined

the Company or the Special Committee to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (iii) immediately
following the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee so
resolving, the Company shall have so notified Parent in writing of the
Companys intention to enter into such Permitted Alternative Agreement
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_ and provided
to Parent the identity of the Person making, and the most current version of
such agreement and all related agreements, exhibits, schedules and other

rise to the Companys notice (as the same may be modified or amended) remains
a Superior Proposal and (v) such termination is made within three (3) Business
Days following the Three Business Day Negotiation Period, if any. No
termination pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_ shall be effective unless the
Company shall simultaneously make the payment required by _Section 5.3(b)_

(h) by Parent or the Company, if the Special Meeting is held and the Company
fails to obtain Company Stockholder Approval at the Special Meeting (or any
reconvened meeting after any adjournment thereof); or

_Accounting End Date_ "), if the Company has not delivered to Parent prior to
the Accounting End Date (x) the Companys restated audited financial
statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005-2009 (the "

opinion of the applicable independent auditor for each of such Restated
Audited Financial Statements, which financial statements shall comply with the
Exchange Act for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or (y) the SEC shall have
agreed and acknowledged in writing that the Companys existing audited

by any party hereto as provided in  _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no further liability or obligation
hereunder on the part of any party hereto or their respective affiliates,
officers, directors or stockholders, except that (a) the last sentence of
_Section 5.1(a)_, _Section 5.3_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_
shall survive such termination and (b) no such termination shall relieve any
party from liability for a material and willful breach of any term or
provision hereof but shall be subject to _Section 5.3(c)_, _Section 5.3(d)_
and _Section 8.2_ and the limitations contained in the Limited Guaranty.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no stockholder of
the Company shall have any right (either on behalf of the Company or in its
own right) to make any claim against the Company, Parent, Acquisition, the
Financing Sources, the Guarantor or any of their respective Related Parties
arising from the failure of the Closing to occur or the termination of this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time except for covenants and
agreements that contemplate performance after the Effective Time
(which covenants and agreements shall survive in accordance with their
terms).

8.2 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any breach or threatened
breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the
parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be
entitled, subject to the terms hereof, to enforce the terms of this Agreement
by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Parent shall be entitled to assert
any other relief available to it in the event of a breach or threatened breach
of a covenant or agreement by the Company hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
institute or prosecute an Action to enforce specific performance of the
Closing if and only if (i) a Specified Financing Breach Termination Event set
forth in clause (y) of the definition thereof has occurred and (ii) the
Company has elected not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of
_Section 7.1_ and not to collect the Financing Breach Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_.



 

67 (b) The Company hereby agrees that, prior to the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Actions under
_Section 8.2(a)_ shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
breaches by Parent or Acquisition of this Agreement, and that, except as
provided in  _Section 8.2(c)_, the Company shall not seek or accept any
other form of relief (including monetary damages) that may be available for
breach by Parent or Acquisition, including any such relief as may be awarded
by any Designated Court (as hereinafter defined) in connection with any
Action related hereto. The Company hereby agrees that it shall not, directly
or indirectly, institute, and shall cause its affiliates not to institute, any
Action arising under, or in connection with (i) the Limited Guaranty against
the Guarantor prior to (A) a Specified Financing Failure Termination Event,
(B) a Specified Financing Breach Termination Event or (C) the termination of
this Agreement as a result of  _Section 7.1(e)_ (other than at a time, if
any, when the Financing Failure Termination Fee or the Financing Breach
Termination Fee is payable, and in each such case Actions under the Limited
Guaranty shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Parent,
Acquisition, the Financing Sources and any of their respective Related
Parties) or (ii) the Equity Commitment Letter, which shall be solely for the
benefit of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or
Acquisition be required to pay more than one of the Financing Failure
Termination Fee, the Financing Breach Termination Fee or the Breach Amount (as
such term is defined in the Limited Guaranty).

 

(c) If the Company elects to seek specific performance to cause the Closing to
occur when permitted to do so under  _Section 8.2(a)_ and a Designated Court
has determined pursuant to a final, nonappealable judgment that Parent and
Acquisition were required to consummate the Closing but such court has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent and Acquisition to
consummate the Closing under _Section 8.2(a)_ pursuant to an action for
specific performance brought against Parent or Acquisition under _Section
8.2(a)_, then Parent shall pay the Financing Breach Termination Fee within
seven (7) Business Days of such judgment; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to receive the Financing Breach Termination Fee
if, within seven (7) Business Days following such grant, Parent notifies the
Company in writing that it agrees to consummate the Merger no later than
fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of such written notice to the
Company and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ in fact, consummates the Merger within such
time period (and, if not so agreed or consummated, the Financing Breach
Termination Fee shall then be due and payable). In addition, the Company
agrees to cause any Action still proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice as
of the Closing or at such other time as Parent consummates the Merger or pays
the Financing Breach Termination Fee.

 

8.3 _Notices_. Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, delivered by
nationally recognized overnight courier service, sent by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid, or sent by facsimile (subject to electronic
confirmation of such facsimile transmission and the sending (on the date of
such facsimile transmission) of a confirmation copy of such facsimile by
nationally recognized overnight courier service or by certified or registered
mail, postage prepaid). Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to
have been given (i) when delivered, if personally delivered, (ii) one
Business Day after it is deposited with a nationally recognized overnight

8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile or portable document format
(pdf)), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

8.8 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the schedules hereto, together with the confidentiality and
nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof (other than the confidentiality, restricted use and nondisclosure
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of each party hereto and to their respective successors
and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in (i) _Section 5.3(c)_ and
_Section 5.3(d)_, which are



 

74  intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Financing
Sources and the respective Related Parties of each of Parent, Acquisition and
the Financing Sources, (ii) _Sections 5.1_ , _5.14(b)_ , _7.2_ , _8.8_ ,
_8.12_ and _8.13_ , which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Financing Sources and their respective Related
Parties and (iii) _Section 5.4_, which is intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Fiduciary Indemnities and the Existing
Indemnities, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person other than the parties to this Agreement
any other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of the
Fiduciary Indemnities and the Existing Indemnities under _Section 5.4_ shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

8.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented,
only by written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the Company at any time
prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no term or
condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended or modified in any
manner that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without so obtaining such further stockholder approval.

8.10 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts required hereby, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed by such party. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

 

8.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims arising hereunder or
relating hereto, shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of Law thereof, except to the extent Laws of the State
of Louisiana apply to the Company in connection with the Merger.

 

8.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Courts for
the State of Delaware (the " _Designated Courts_ "), in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that, subject to rights with respect to post-trial
motions and rights of appeal or other avenues of review, a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have 



 

75  to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in the Designated Courts. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether at Law or
equity, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources
or any of their respective Related Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any such action, cause of action or claim against the Financing Sources or any
of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof) in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER), WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER
IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS
ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH
WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER
IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN
WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

 

8.13 _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any
assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each of Parent and Acquisition may assign
its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates (with prior written
notice to the Company) and (ii) each of Parent and Acquisition may assign its
rights hereunder as collateral security to any 



 

76  Financing Source or other lender to Parent or Acquisition or an affiliate of
Parent or Acquisition, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Acquisition, as the case may be, of any obligation or liability hereunder,
and the Limited Guaranty shall, as a condition for any such assignment, be
appropriately amended to the extent necessary to provide the same benefits to
the Company as existed prior to such assignment.

 

8.14 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by final judgment no longer
subject to review, to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all
other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the
transactions contemplated herein is affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner.
