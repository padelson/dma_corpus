 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Acquiror, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, (i) to all its properties (including, without limitation, any Company Property), books, Contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and (ii) to all other information concerning its business, properties (including, without limitation, any Company Property) and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request.

Acquiror shall, and shall cause its representatives to, take all reasonable efforts to prevent such access and inspection from unreasonably interfering with the business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) All information obtained by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated April 19, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Acquiror and the Company. 

   

 6.04 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

  

 (a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.04_, neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company nor any of the officers and directors of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives (such employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives of its Subsidiaries, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any such inquiry, proposal, offer, discussion or negotiations. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company may: (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person with respect to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by the Company or the Partnership after the date hereof, if the Company or the 

    ##### 

  

  

Partnership receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other
party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making,
or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage or participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, or (C) after having complied with _Section
6.04(c)_, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking
any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
failure to take such action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the
terms of this Agreement, would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the directors duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law, and
(y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company
Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available
and after consultation with its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to
a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal. 

   

 (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange, business combination or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the total voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries and by way of a merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange, business combination or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Agreement that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment, taking into account legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, is more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view than the Company Merger. For the purposes of this definition, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the above definition of Acquisition Proposal, except that (i) that the reference to a proposal or offer with respect to a merger, tender offer, statutory share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or the Partnership in clause (i) shall refer to such proposals or offers that relate to more than 50% of the voting power of the Company or the Partnership and (ii) all references to "20%" shall be deemed references to "50%". 

   

 (c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The Company Board shall not: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys shareholders approve the Company Merger; or 

  

 (ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in compliance with  _Section 6.04(a)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Superior Proposal. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company
Board may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation that the
Companys shareholders approve the Company Merger and this Agreement, or
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal, if
the Company is not in violation of this _Section 6.04_ and the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that a
Superior Proposal exists and the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the directors duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law (a "
_Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Change
of Recommendation may be made until after at least three (3) Business Days
following Acquirors receipt of notice from the Company advising that
management of the Company currently intends to recommend to the Company Board
that it take such action and the basis therefor, including all necessary
information under _Section 6.04(d)_. 

   

 (d) _Existing Discussions_. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.04_. Each of the Company and the Partnership also agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (e) _Notice_. Each of the Company and the Partnership agrees that it will as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Acquiror if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by it or any of its Representatives and indicate, in connection with such notice, the name of the Person who has made such inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements), and thereafter shall keep Acquiror reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified. 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.05 _Further Action_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective each of the Mergers, including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and other Persons as are necessary for the consummation of the Mergers and to fulfill the conditions to the Closing and as Acquiror otherwise deems reasonably necessary or appropriate. Without the prior written consent of Acquiror, neither the Company, the Partnership nor any Subsidiary of the Company may (i) pay or commit to pay (or agree to commit to any other material obligation) to obtain any such consent, approval, authorization, qualification or order or (ii) enter into, modify or amend any Contract in connection with obtaining such consent, approval, authorization, qualification or order. In case, at any time after the Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective officers, employees and agents to take all such action. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate and assist one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to _Section 6.05(a)_, including the preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing, and to the extent practicable none of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority or required pursuant to any of the Property Documents, without prior consultation with the other parties. Each party shall keep the others apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority or any counterparty to a Property Document with respect to each of the Mergers. To the extent practicable, and as permitted by a Governmental Authority or any Property Documents, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings (whether by telephone or in Person) with such Governmental Authority or counterparty to such Property Documents. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of each of the Mergers, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, the Company shall not, without the consent of Acquiror, be permitted to obtain any consent that will affect Acquiror or the Company to either of their material economic detriment, including any modification of any Contract or Company Permit. In connection with the obtaining of consents from third parties or obviating the need to obtain such consents, if reasonably requested by Acquiror, the Company shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute any documents, agreements and instruments and   ##### 

  

  

  

take such other actions, in each case, to the extent reasonable and
practicable, in accordance with applicable Law and the Companys
Organizational Documents and the applicable formation and governing contracts
of the Subsidiaries of the Company, all in such order, form and substance as
reasonably requested by Acquiror. 

   

 (e) Acquiror (or, as applicable, the applicable Taxable REIT Subsidiary pursuant to an Operating Lease with the Company Property Owner) or a management company or one or more Subsidiaries of any one of those entities (the " _Operator_ ") may, at its own cost and expense, pursue such license applications and other documents as Acquiror may deem necessary, in its sole discretion, for Acquiror or Acquirors Operator to obtain all licenses and/or permits with respect to each of the Company Properties that are necessary to serve or sell liquor, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages from any restaurants, snack bars, bars, mini bars, lounges and other food and beverage sales locations located with any of the Company Properties (collectively, the " _Liquor Licenses_ "); provided that no such action shall adversely affect the Companys licenses or relationships with licensors. To the extent permitted by Law, and to the extent that Liquor Licenses are not currently held by the third party or its Subsidiary under a Management Agreement for a Company Property where such third party shall continue to operate such Company Property under such Management Agreement from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer or cause to be transferred to Acquiror or Operator, all Liquor Licenses as of the Company Merger Effective Time. The Company and its Subsidiaries and Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate with each other, and each shall execute or cause to be executed such transfer forms, license applications and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to effect such transfers and/or to permit Acquiror or Acquirors Operator to obtain new Liquor Licenses. If permitted under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which a Company Property is located, such parties shall execute or cause to be executed and file all reasonably necessary transfer forms, applications and papers with the appropriate alcoholic beverage authorities prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, to the end that the transfer of the existing Liquor Licenses or Acquiror or Acquirors Operators obtaining new licenses shall take effect, if possible, at the Company Merger Effective Time. 

   

 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Each of Acquiror and the Company agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Mergers shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

  

 6.07 _Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee, officer, director or other fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws, the Partnership Agreement, the certificate of limited partnership of the Partnership or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, from and after the Company Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Company and the Surviving Partnership, as applicable, shall:   ##### 

  

  

  

(i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is at the date hereof or
during the period from the date hereof through the Company Merger Effective
Date serving as a director or executive officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee
benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the
" _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection
with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties
or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within thirty days after any request for advancement, advance
to each of the Company Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses
incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Company Indemnified
Party of any Expenses incurred by such Company Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security, _provided_  that the Company Indemnified Party to whom any Expenses
are advanced provides prior to the receipt of any funds in respect of such
Expenses an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.
The indemnification and advancement obligations of Acquiror, the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership pursuant to this _Section 6.07(a)_
shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Company Merger
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection
therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification
and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who
has ceased to be a director, executive officer or other fiduciary of the
Company or its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the
benefit of such Persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 6.07(a)_, (i) the term " _Claim_ "
means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or
proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party
hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other party, that any Company
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
such Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative
dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to such Company Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section

prior to the Company Merger Effective Time at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations
(including, without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court

as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred
in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this _Section 6.07(a)_, including any Action relating
to a claim for 

  ##### 

  

   

indemnification or advancement brought by a Company Indemnified Party. None
of Acquiror, the Surviving Company nor the Surviving Partnership shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
in respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such
Company Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes an unconditional release of such Company Indemnified Party
from all liability arising out of such claim, demand, Action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation or such Company Indemnified Party
otherwise consents thereto. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Partnership agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Company Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees or other fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws or other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company) shall be assumed by the Surviving Company in the Company Merger, without further action, at the Company Merger Effective Time, and shall survive the Company Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Company shall (i) for a period of six years after the Company Merger Effective Time cause to be maintained in effect in its charter or bylaws (or similar governing documents), provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of Expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries as those currently contained in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws and (ii) maintain for a period of at least six years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Company Merger Effective Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 6.07(c)_ which in the aggregate exceed 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose; _provided_ that Acquiror shall nevertheless be obligated to provide the maximum amount of such coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the Company Merger Effective Time, as may be obtained for such 300% amount. The provisions of clause (ii) of this subsection (c) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by Acquiror on behalf of the Surviving Company for purposes of this _Section 6.07_, which policies (together with Companys existing policy) provide such directors and officers with the coverage described in this subsection (c) for an aggregate period of not less than six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Company Merger Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) If the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the   ##### 

  

  

  

continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership assumes the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.07_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
Acquiror guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Companys
and the Surviving Partnerships obligations pursuant to this  _Section
6.07_. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 6.07 _shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.07_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives. 

   

 6.08 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

In addition, Acquiror shall cause each Acquiror Benefit Plan, as applicable, to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions, "at-work requirements" and waiting periods, except to the extent that comparable limitations, "at-work requirements" or waiting periods would have continued to apply to such Continuing Employees under a corresponding Benefit Plan after the Company Merger Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-   #####

and (v) taking all corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit the
consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made

Acquiror agrees to amend this _Section 9.03(e)_ at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Acquiror Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 9.03(e)_ or (iii) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.03(e)_. The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Acquiror Termination Fee held in escrow for five (5) years shall be released by the escrow agent to Acquiror. Acquiror shall not be a party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.
