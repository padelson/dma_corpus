-iii- _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 5,
2016, is by and among Spectra Energy Corp, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Enbridge Inc., a Canadian corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Sand
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," with Parent, the Company and Merger Sub
sometimes being hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively referred to as the " _Parties_ ").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger, pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (ii) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and the holders of shares of the
Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), and (iii) resolved, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to
recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock adopt this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") and of
Merger Sub have each unanimously, of those voting, approved this Agreement,
determined that the consummation of the Merger is in the best interests of
Parent and Merger Sub, and the Parent Board has resolved, subject to the terms
of this Agreement, to recommend that the holders of shares of Parent Common
Stock approve each of the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger and the Bylaw Amendment upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, by virtue of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
shall receive Parent common shares, no par value per share (the " _Parent
Common Stock_ "), as more particularly set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger
shall (i) qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and (ii) not
result in gain being recognized pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code by
Persons who are stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any such stockholder that would be a "five-percent
transferee shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the Merger that does not enter into
a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8), and the Parties intend that this Agreement be
and hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and to set forth certain conditions to the Merger, in each case as set
forth below.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and,
following the Merger, shall be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and
the separate corporate existence of the Company with all of its rights,
obligations, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in this Agreement. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in the DGCL.

1.2. _Closing_. Unless another time, date or place is mutually agreed in
writing between the Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125
Broad Street, New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on the third
Business Day (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ")
after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions).

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
Parties will cause a Certificate of Merger of the Company and Merger Sub (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4. _The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. Subject
to the requirements set forth in Section 6.15, at the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
Spectra Energy Corp.

 



-2- 1.5. _The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time the bylaws of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until thereafter amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be Spectra Energy Corp.

1.6. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all actions necessary so that the Board of Directors of Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

1.7. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall take all
actions necessary so that the officers of the Company as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

1.8. _Canadian Offer._

 

(a) Parent shall, concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus, make
an offer (the " _Parent Canadian Offer_ ") to each holder of one or more
shares of Company Common Stock who is:

(i) a resident of Canada for the purposes of the _Income Tax Act (Canada)_
(the " _ITA_ "); or

(ii) a partnership at least one partner of which is a resident of Canada for
the purposes of the ITA;

(each a " _Canadian Company Shareholder_ ") to purchase, subject to the
consummation of the Merger, all of such shares held by each Canadian Company
Shareholder in consideration for the Merger Consideration, determined in
accordance with Article II assuming such shares of Company Common Stock had
been owned by the Canadian Company Shareholder at the Effective Time. Subject
to satisfaction or waiver of all conditions (other than those relating to the
Parent Canadian Offer and those that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) pursuant to this Agreement, each purchase of shares of Company
Common Stock from a Canadian Company Shareholder who validly tenders his, her
or its shares of Company Common Stock to Parent pursuant to the Parent
Canadian Offer will be completed immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Any Canadian Company Shareholder who accepts the Parent Canadian Offer not
later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
its terms and conditions shall be entitled to make an income tax election,
pursuant to subsection 85(1) or

 



-3-  85(2) of the ITA, as applicable (and the analogous provisions of provincial
or territorial income tax law) with respect to the transfer by the Canadian
Company Shareholder of shares of Company Common Stock to Parent if such
Canadian Company Shareholder delivers to Parent, in accordance with
instructions to be set out on Parents website not later than the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, duly completed election forms required by the
Canadian Company Shareholder to make the joint election pursuant to subsection
85(1) or 85(2) of the ITA, as applicable (and the analogous provisions of
provincial or territorial income tax law) complete with the details of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock transferred and the applicable
agreed amount or amounts for the purposes of such election or elections.
Parent will not execute or file any election that is received by Parent more
than 60 days after the Closing Date. If Parent receives a properly completed
election within 60 days of the Closing Date, Parent will sign and forward such
election to the Canada Revenue Agency and any applicable provincial or
territorial taxation authority on or before the date that is 90 days
following the Closing Date. Parent, the Company or any nominee thereof will
not be responsible for the proper completion of any election, except for the
obligation of Parent to sign and forward to the Canada Revenue Agency (and
any applicable provincial or territorial taxation authority) a duly completed
election that is received by Parent within 60 days of the Closing Date.
Parent, the Company or any nominee thereof will not be responsible or liable
for taxes, interest, penalties, damages or expenses resulting from the failure
by anyone to properly complete any election.

(c) The Proxy/Prospectus shall include instructions detailing how Canadian
Company Shareholders can accept the Parent Canadian Offer and the terms and
conditions of the Parent Canadian Offer. Parent and the Company shall, in good
faith, jointly prepare such instructions and terms and conditions (which
terms and conditions shall be customary for a transaction such as the Parent
Canadian Offer).

 

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Canadian Company Shareholder
that is not tendered to Parent in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Parent Canadian Offer shall be subject to the Merger in accordance with
this Agreement other than this Section 1.8.

 



-4- ARTICLE II

 

 _Merger Consideration; Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_

 

2.1. _Merger Consideration_ _; Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_.
At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of the Company,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time other than Excluded Shares (such shares of Company Common
Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted into, and
become exchangeable for, 0.984 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

2.2. _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any
capital stock of the Company, as of the Effective Time, all of the Eligible
Shares shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Article II shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing any of the
Eligible Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each book-entry
account formerly representing any non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section
3.5 cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such Eligible Shares have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.1 and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 3.3.

 

2.3. _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than
Excluded Shares held by Parent) shall, as a result of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded Share, as of the
Effective Time, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Each Excluded Share held
by Parent shall, as a result of the Merger, become and be converted into one
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.4. _Merger Sub_ _; Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation having an aggregate redemption
amount and fair market value equal to the aggregate fair market value of the
converted Merger Sub shares.

(b) In consideration for the issuance by Parent of the Merger Consideration,
the Surviving Corporation shall, at the Effective Time, issue to Parent that
number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall take all actions necessary so that, prior to
the Effective Time, the authorized share capital of Merger Sub shall consist
of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 1,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.

 



-5- 2.5. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") under the
Stock Plans of the Company, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent
an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted
into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (a "
_Parent Option_ ") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company
Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such
option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code, and, in the case of a Company Option that is held by a
person who is subject to section 7 of the ITA in respect of the Company
Option, the exercise price of a Parent Option shall be further adjusted in
such manner so as to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for a tax-
deferred exchange of Company Options pursuant to subsection 7(1.4) of the ITA.
Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each
Company Option that has converted into a Parent Option shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and
exercisability terms) as were applicable to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Company Phantom Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding phantom
unit denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Phantom
Unit_ ") under the Stock Plans of the Company, whether vested or unvested,
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to represent a phantom unit denominated in shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be adjusted to represent a phantom unit denominated in shares
of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Phantom Unit_ "). The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Phantom Unit shall be equal
to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Phantom Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such Parent Phantom Unit shall continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms) as were applicable to the
applicable Company Phantom Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-6- (c) _Company PSUs_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance stock unit denominated
in shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company PSU_ ") under the Stock Plans
of the Company granted after December 31, 2015, shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a
performance stock unit denominated in shares of Company Common Stock and
shall be adjusted to represent a service-based stock unit denominated in
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock-Based RSU_ "). The number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based RSU
shall be equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with any performance-based vesting
conditions deemed satisfied based on actual performance through the Effective
Time as provided in the applicable award agreement) multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such Parent Stock-Based RSU shall continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions (including service vesting terms,
but excluding any performance vesting terms) as were applicable to the
applicable Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company PSU under the Stock Plans
of the Company granted in 2014 or 2015, shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time determined in accordance with the immediately following
sentence multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, together with a cash payment
equal to the amount of any dividend equivalents accrued with respect to such
Company PSU. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU shall
be determined, (1) for any Company PSU granted in 2014, assuming a vesting
percentage of 100%, and (2) for any Company PSU granted in 2015, with the
vesting percentage determined as set forth in Section 2(a) of the applicable
award agreement (except that performance shall be based upon the Companys
total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the peer
group for the period beginning on January 1, 2015, and ending on the date on
which the Effective Time occurs as required by Section 2(c) of the applicable
award agreement). Parent shall provide the consideration described in this
Section 2.5(c)(ii) within ten Business Days following the Closing Date, less
applicable withholdings.

(d) _Company Other Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock
or benefits measured by the value of shares of Company Common Stock, and each
award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock that may be
held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock
Plans of the Company and any other Benefit Plans of the Company, other than
Company Options, Company Phantom Units and Company PSUs (a " _Company Other
Award_ "), shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be deemed to be adjusted to represent the right to acquire or
receive benefits

 



-7-  measured by the value of (as applicable) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Other Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, and to the extent such Company Other Award provides for payments to the
extent the value of the shares of Company Common Stock exceed a specified
reference price, at a reference price per share (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (A) the reference price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Company Other Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such right shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions (including, as applicable, vesting and
exercisability terms) as were applicable to the rights under the relevant
Stock Plan or other Benefit Plan of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(e) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board (and/or the Compensation Committee thereof), as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, Company Phantom Units,
Company PSUs and Company Other Awards (the " _Company Equity Awards_ ")
pursuant to Sections 2.5(a) through 2.5(d).

(f) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all actions that are necessary for
the assumption of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to Sections 2.5(a), (b),
(c) and (d) including the reservation, issuance (subject to Section 2.5(e))
and listing of Parent Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.5. If registration of any plan interests in the
Stock Plans or other Benefit Plans of the Company or the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), Parent shall file with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on the Closing Date a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or such other appropriate form) with
respect to such interests or Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as the relevant Stock Plans or other Benefit Plans of the
Company, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests
therein or the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to
be required. As soon as reasonably practicable after the registration of such
interests or shares, as applicable, appropriate notices shall be given to the
holders of Company Equity Awards setting forth such holders rights pursuant
to the respective Stock Plans, other Benefit Plans and agreements evidencing
the grants of such Company Equity Awards, and stating that such Company Equity
Awards and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.5 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Stock
Plans).

 

2.6. _Tax Consequences of the Merger_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the Merger shall (i) qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) not result in gain
being recognized pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code by Persons who are
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any such stockholder that would be a "five-percent transferee
shareholder" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent

 



-8-  following the Merger that does not enter into a five-year gain recognition
agreement in the form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8),
and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Delivery of Merger Consideration; Procedures for Surrender_

 

3.1. _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with a nationally recognized financial institution or
trust company selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to serve
as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Canadian Offer and
Eligible Shares, (a) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in uncertificated form or book-entry form comprising the amounts
required to be delivered in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to Section 1.8 and Section 2.1, and (b) an aggregate amount of cash comprising
approximately the amount required to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.5. In
addition, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends
or other distributions, if any, to which the holders of Eligible Shares may
be entitled pursuant to Section 3.3 with both a record and payment date after
the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such Eligible Shares Such
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 3.5 and the amount of any dividends or other distributions
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1 are referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be promptly returned to Parent. To the extent there are
losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. No investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any former holder of Eligible Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

 

3.2. _Procedure_ _s for Surrender_.

 

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Eligible Shares that are (i) Certificates or
(ii) Book-Entry Shares notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of
the Merger, including (A) appropriate transmittal 

 



-9-  materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as
provided in Section 3.7) or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares), such materials to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent desires with approval of the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (B) instructions for
surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in Section 3.7) or transferring the Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or distributions, in each
case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. With respect to Book-Entry Shares, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and the holders of
Book-Entry Shares to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to such
holder or its nominees on the Closing Date (or if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date), upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by
such holder or its nominees in accordance with customary
surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which the
beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in Section 3.7) or that are Book-Entry
Shares, by book-receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent in
connection with the transfer of Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with the
terms of the Letter of Transmittal and accompanying instructions or, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with customary procedures and such
other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, and the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 and
(ii) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds (or, if no wire
transfer instructions are provided, a check, and in each case, after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.8) of (A)
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.5 _plus_
(B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III.

(c) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Eligible Shares, and any Certificate or ledger entry relating to
Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock that
have been so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of certificated Eligible Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with an amount (if any) in
immediately available funds (or, if no wire transfer instructions are
provided, a check, and in each case, after giving effect to any required 

 



-10-  Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.8) of cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate and any dividends or distributions in respect
thereof, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Eligible Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory
to the Exchange Agent. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Article III, including any amount payable in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.5, and any dividends or
other distributions on Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3, in
each case without interest.

3.3. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company Common
Stock; Voting_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement.
No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Eligible Share until the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in Section 3.7) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
such surrender, there shall be issued or paid to the holder of record of the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Eligible Shares in
accordance with this Article III, without interest, (a) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and not paid and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

3.4. _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 

3.5. _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon
the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1. All
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of Eligible Shares
would be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant

 



-11-  to Section 2.1 shall be aggregated and rounded to three decimal places. Any
holder of Eligible Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock but for this Section 3.5 shall be entitled to receive a
cash payment, without interest, in lieu of any fractional share, which payment
shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders
proportionate interest in a share of Parent Common Stock based on the Average
Parent Stock Price. No holder of Eligible Shares shall be entitled by virtue
of the right to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock described in this Section 3.5 to any dividends, voting rights or any
other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration and solely represents a mechanical
rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

3.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any shares
of Parent Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Eligible Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock of such stockholders
and any payment of cash and any dividends and other distributions in respect
thereof payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 3.3 and Section
3.5, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Eligible Shares
immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

3.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash and any unpaid dividends or other distributions
that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

3.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Corporation such withheld amounts (a) shall be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made to the extent such withheld amounts are
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

 



-12- 3.9. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII, the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or securities or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger or other similar transaction, then the Exchange
Ratio and any other number or amount contained in this Agreement which is
based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, and such items, as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio.
Nothing in this Section 3.9 shall be construed to permit the Company or
Parent to take any action prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

a party or by which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries is bound with
respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interest of such
Party or any of the Subsidiaries of such Party, or restricting the transfer
of, or providing registration rights with respect to, such capital stock or
equity interest.

 



-16- (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Opinions of Financial Advisors_.

 

(i) Such Party has all requisite corporate power and authority and, other
than, in the case of Parent, the approval of each of the Bylaw Amendment and

the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock representing a majority of the
votes cast on such matter at a meeting of Parents shareholders duly
called and held for such purpose (together, the " _Requisite Parent Vote_ "),
and in the case of the Company, adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
on such matter at a meeting of the Companys stockholders duly called and
held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "), has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by such Party and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the other Parties, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of such Party enforceable against such Party in accordance with its
terms.

 

(ii) In the case of the Company, the Company Board has, as of the date of this

award, injunction or similar order of any Governmental Entity that would
restrict in a material respect the future activity or conduct of such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(xiv) make any changes with respect to financial accounting policies or

the Merger.

 



-37- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Partys
obligations under Section 6.1(a) to take an action or not to take an action,
or to cause its Subsidiaries to take an action or not to take an action,
shall, with respect to any entities (and their respective subsidiaries)

interpreted in such a way as to require compliance by any Party if such
compliance would result in the violation of any rule, regulation or policy of
any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity
with jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws (any
such Governmental Entity, a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") or
applicable Law.

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company and Parent each
shall not, and none of its respective Subsidiaries nor any of its respective
directors and officers shall, and the Company and Parent shall each instruct
its and its Subsidiaries investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or take any action to
knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with or
negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than to state that the terms of this provision prohibit such
discussions); or

 



-38- (iii) provide any non-public information to any Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.2(g), prior to the time, but not after, in the case of the Company, the
Requisite Company Vote is obtained or, in the case of Parent, the Requisite
Parent Vote is obtained, in response to an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from such Partys breach of Section
6.2(a) in any material respect), the Company (including its Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers and Representatives) or Parent
(including its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and
Representatives), as applicable, may:

 

(i) contact such Person or group of Persons solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof;

 

(ii) provide information in response to a general or specific request therefor
(including non-public information regarding it or any of its Subsidiaries) to
the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, provided that such non-public
information has previously been made available to, or is made available to,
Parent or the Company, as applicable, prior to or concurrently with the
time such non-public information is made available to such Person and that,
prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, receives from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement with terms not less restrictive in the
aggregate to the other Party than the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement
are on Parent or the Company, as applicable (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amending of an
Acquisition Proposal); and

(iii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such
Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

only if, prior to taking any action described in clause (ii) or (iii) above,
the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor,
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) The Company and Parent each shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) give notice to the other Party if (i) any inquiries, proposals or
offers constituting an Acquisition Proposal are received by the Company or
Parent (as applicable), (ii) any initial request for information in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or Parent (as
applicable), or (iii) any initial request for discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company or Parent,
as applicable, setting forth in such notice the name of such Person and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, complete copies of any written requests, proposals or offers,
including proposed agreements), and thereafter shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis of the status and material
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any material
change in its intentions as previously notified.

 



-39- (d) Except as permitted by Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f), the Parent Board
(including any committee thereof) or the Company Board (including any
committee thereof), as applicable, shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation or the
Parent Recommendation, as applicable, with respect to the Merger in a manner
adverse to Parent or the Company, as applicable; or

 

(ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly
propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(b)
entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(b)) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ", and any of the actions
set forth in the foregoing clause (i) and this clause (ii), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, in the case of the Company, the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained or, in the case of Parent, the Requisite Parent Vote is obtained, the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, may effect a Change of
Recommendation if the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor and in compliance with this Section 6.2, that, as a result
of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, failure to take such action
could be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, may not be made unless
and until the Company or Parent, as applicable, has given Parent or the
Company, as applicable, written notice of such action four Business Days in
advance, such notice to comply in form, substance and delivery with the
provisions of Section 6.2(c) and Section 9.6 of this Agreement, setting forth
in writing that the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, intends
to consider whether to take such action and the basis therefor. After giving
such notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation in connection
with a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall afford the other Party the opportunity to
negotiate during such four Business Day period with Parent or the Company, as
applicable (to the extent Parent or the Company, as applicable, wishes to
negotiate) to enable such Party to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board or the Parent Board, as
applicable, not to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable. At the end of such four
Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, as
applicable, the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent or
the Company, as applicable, in writing in response to such notice, and shall
have

 



-40-  determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, if the
changes to the terms of this Agreement offered in writing (if any) were to be
given effect and that the failure to take such action could be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal (including any change in the amount or
form of consideration) will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of Section 6.2(c) and this Section 6.2(e), except that references to
four Business Days shall be deemed to be references to three Business Days (
_provided_ that the initial notice period provided for above shall not be less
than four Business Days).

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives, from
complying with their respective disclosure obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation or the
Parent Recommendation, as applicable, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Change of Recommendation and Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall have
the option to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(f) or
Section 8.1(g), as applicable; it being understood that a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or any statement that the Company has received a
proposal and is considering such proposal shall not be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation.

 

(g) Further to Section 6.2(a), the Company and Parent shall each promptly end
any existing discussions and negotiations conducted heretofore with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or proposal or transaction
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Further,
the Company and Parent shall each promptly terminate any physical and
electronic data access previously granted to such Persons and request that
any such Persons promptly return or destroy all confidential information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

 

(h) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision
of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof; provided that if
the Company Board or Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards or Parent
Boards, as applicable, fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, may waive any such standstill provision solely to the
extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis to
the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, an Acquisition Proposal;
provided that the waiving Party promptly advises the other Party that it is
taking such action. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Parties
that it has not taken any action

 



-41-  that (i) would be prohibited by this Section 6.2(h) or (ii) but for the
ability to take actions to avoid a potential breach of the Company Boards or
Parent Boards, as applicable, fiduciary duties would have been prohibited by
this Section 6.2(h), during the 60 days prior to the date of this Agreement.

6.3.  _Proxy/Prospectus Filing; Management Information Circular; Information
Supplied_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly jointly prepare and file with the
SEC a proxy statement relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting and a
prospectus that Parent will use in the United States to offer the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (such proxy
statement and prospectus, together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy/Prospectus_ "), and Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 pursuant to which the offer and
sale of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger will be registered pursuant to the Securities Act and which will
include the Proxy/Prospectus as a part thereof (such registration statement,
together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ ") as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 20
Business Days after the date hereof ( _provided_ , that no Party shall be in
breach of this timing obligation to the extent the delay is the result of an
inability, after reasonable best efforts, to prepare required pro forma
financial statements). Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to comments from the SEC and have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, to maintain such effectiveness for as long
as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and to promptly thereafter mail the Proxy/Prospectus to the
stockholders of the Company. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts
to satisfy, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement, all
necessary state securities Law or "blue sky" notice requirements in connection
with the Merger and to consummate the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare and, concurrently with the mailing of the
Proxy/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall (i)
file with the Canadian Securities Regulators a management information
circular for the purpose of seeking the approval of its shareholders of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and
the Bylaw Amendment (with, subject to applicable Law, the information
contained therein being consistent in all material respects with substantive
information contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) (the " _Management
Information Circular_ ") and (ii) mail the Management Information Circular to
the shareholders of Parent.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of the
receipt of all comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy/Prospectus
or for additional information and shall promptly provide to the other copies
of all correspondence between it and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Registration Statement or Proxy/Prospectus.

 



-42- (d) The Company and Parent will cause the Proxy/Prospectus and Registration
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Parent will cause the Management Information Circular to comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable Law (including Securities Laws).

(e) Each of Parent and the Company will provide their respective legal counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the
Proxy/Prospectus, the Management Information Circular, the Registration
Statement and other documents related to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Parent Shareholders Meeting, the issuance of the shares of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Merger and the Bylaw Amendment, prior to filing
such documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such
documents to the Companys and Parents stockholders/shareholders, as
applicable. Each Party will include in the Proxy/Prospectus, the Management
Information Circular, the Registration Statement and such other documents
related to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Parent Shareholders Meeting
or the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of the Merger
all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other Party or its legal
counsel and each agrees that all information relating to Parent and
its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy/Prospectus, the Management Information
Circular and the Registration Statement shall be in form and content
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably, and all information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy/Prospectus, the Management
Information Circular and the Registration Statement shall be in form and
content satisfactory to the Company, acting reasonably.

 

6.4. _Stockholders/Shareholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene the
Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective (and in any event within 35 days thereof), to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote
to be taken; _provided_ that the Company, in reasonable consultation with
Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a later
date to the extent the Company believes in good faith that such adjournment or
postponement is reasonably necessary (i) to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy/Prospectus is provided to the holders of
Company Common Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote,
(iii) to ensure that there are sufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iv)
to otherwise comply with applicable Law.

 

(b) Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to convene the Parent
Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective and the Management Information Circular is
filed with the Canadian Securities Regulators (and in any event within 35 days
thereof) to consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of shares of

 



-43-  Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the Bylaw Amendment
and to cause such vote to be taken; _provided_ that Parent, in reasonable
consultation with the Company, may adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholders Meeting to a later date to the extent Parent believes in good
faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary (i) to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Management Information Circular is provided to the holders of Parent Common
Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Parent Shareholders
Meeting, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite Parent Vote, (iii) to ensure that
there are sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Shareholders Meeting or (iv) to otherwise comply with
applicable Law.

(c) The Company Board shall, subject to Section 6.2, include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy/Prospectus, and Parent shall, subject to
Section 6.2, include the Parent Recommendation in the Management Information
Circular. Each of the Company and Parent shall take all lawful action to
solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent
Vote. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to schedule and convene such
meetings on the same date and time. The Company and Parent each agrees (i) to
provide the other reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly
providing periodic voting reports) and (ii) to give written notice to the
other Party one day prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, and on the day of, but prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as
applicable, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies representing
the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote, as applicable,
appear to have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date
that is one Business Day prior to the date the Company Stockholders Meeting or
the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, is scheduled (in either case,
the " _Original Date_ "), (A) the Company or Parent, as applicable has not
received proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite
Parent Vote, as applicable, whether or not a quorum is present or (B) it is
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy/Prospectus
or the Management Information Circular is required to be delivered, Parent and
the Company, as applicable, shall, postpone or adjourn, or make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting
or the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable as long as the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as
applicable is not postponed or adjourned more than ten days in connection with
any one postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of twenty days
from the Original Date in reliance on the preceding sentence.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and
Parent agrees that its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, pursuant to this Section
6.4 shall not be affected by the making of a Change of Recommendation by the
Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.4 shall not be affected by the commencement of or announcement
or disclosure of or communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable, of
any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence or disclosure of an
Intervening Event as to the Company or Parent, as applicable, and further,
that it shall not take action to terminate this Agreement on the grounds that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal or with regards to such
Intervening Event until such time as either the Company or Parent, as
applicable, may terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 8.1.

 



-44- 6.5. _Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately after the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting this
Agreement. Such consent shall not be modified or rescinded and Parent shall
deliver such consent to the Company promptly upon the execution thereof.

6.6.  _Cooperation; Efforts to Consummate_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including this
Section 6.6), the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) take or cause to be taken all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing
promptly all documentation to effect all necessary notices, notifications,
petitions, applications, reports and other filings (including any required
or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date) all consents, clearances, registrations, approvals, expirations or

advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (iv) if agreed to by Parent and the Company, acting
jointly and in good faith, obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
(including on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries) agrees (i) to make
appropriate submissions and filings of notification and report forms pursuant
to the HSR Act and the Competition Act (Canada) with respect to the Merger as
promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty-five (25) Business Days
of the date of this Agreement, unless the Parties agree in writing otherwise,
and (ii) to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant
to the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada), or any other Antitrust Law and

respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this Section 6.6
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act and to obtain the Competition Act (Canada) Clearance
as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date).

 



-45- (c) Each Party shall use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or
before a Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of (and supply to the
other Parties) any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, the Canadian Competition Bureau, or any other
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
permit the other Party to review in advance and give reasonable consideration
to the other Partys comments in any communication to be given by it to any
Governmental Entity with respect to obtaining any clearances required under
any Antitrust Law in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) consult with the other Party in
advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences. Subject to the obligations in this Section 6.6,
Parent shall have the right to devise and implement the strategy and timing
for obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining such clearances; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall consult in advance with the Company and in good faith take
the Companys views into account regarding the overall strategy and timing.
The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this Section 6.6 in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) Parent (including on behalf of its Subsidiaries) agrees to take, or cause
to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or
cause to be made (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a Governmental Entity may
assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to
occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the
Outside Date, including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, consent agreement, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent
or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries), (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any
joint venture held by Parent or the Company (or any of their respective

 



-46-  Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, or in the alternative,
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any action or proceeding seeking
to prohibit the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date. To assist Parent in
complying with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.6, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements
requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing
with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any
action that limits the Companys or its Subsidiaries freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold,
directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) the consummation of the transactions provided for in any such
agreement for a Divestiture Action (a " _Divestiture Agreement_ ") shall be
conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions to
Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately following such
Divestiture Action (and where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the
Closing immediately following such Divestiture Action) and (ii) Parent shall
indemnify for and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from all
costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries arising from or relating to such Divestiture Agreement (other
than any of the foregoing arising from the breach by the Company or any
applicable Subsidiary of such Divestiture Agreement). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.6, nothing contained in this Agreement
requires the Company or Parent to take, or cause to be taken, and neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required to take, or cause to be taken, any
Divestiture Action with respect to all or part of the Texas Eastern
Transmission pipeline, the Enbridge Canadian Mainline System or the Enbridge
U.S. Mainline System.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 6.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened or recommended to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use its best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding (or such threat or recommendation) and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.6,
each of the Company and Parent agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain the CFIUS Clearance. Such reasonable best efforts shall include,
promptly after the date hereof, making or causing to be made any draft and
final CFIUS Notices required in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 and the
other requirements of the DPA, and after prompt resolution of all questions
and comments received 

 



-47-  from CFIUS on such draft, shall prepare and submit the final CFIUS Notice,
which shall in any event be made promptly after the date all questions and
comments received from CFIUS on such draft have been resolved or after CFIUS
staff shall have indicated to the Parties that it has no questions or
comments. Such reasonable best efforts shall also include providing any
information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the
U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, within the time periods specified
by 31 C.F.R. §800.403(a)(3), or otherwise specified by the CFIUS staff,
without the need to request an extension of time. Each of Parent and the
Company shall, in connection with the efforts to obtain the CFIUS Clearance,
(i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with
the CFIUS Notice, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, CFIUS, by promptly
providing copies to the other Party of any such written communications, except
for any exhibits to such communications providing the personal identifying
information required by 31 C.F.R. §800.402(c)(6)(vi); and (iii) permit the
other Party to review in advance any communication that it gives to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting, telephone call or
conference with CFIUS, and to the extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any telephonic
conferences or in-person meetings with CFIUS, in each of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 6.6(e), subject to confidentiality considerations
contemplated by the DPA or required by CFIUS. Such reasonable best efforts
shall also include agreeing to any action, condition or restriction required
by CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Clearance (including entering into any
mitigation agreement with CFIUS as may be required) in order to receive the
CFIUS Clearance as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior
to the sixth Business Day prior to the Outside Date, unless the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably waived the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(e) [ _CFIUS Clearance_ ] prior to such date. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall take or permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the receipt of the CFIUS Clearance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
covenants and agreements set forth in Section 6.6(a) [ _Efforts_ ] and this
Section 6.6(e) constitute the sole obligations of the Parties with respect to
the efforts required to obtain the CFIUS Clearance.

6.7. _Status_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise required by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company,
as applicable, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.8. _Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to commence, as soon as reasonably
practical following the receipt of a written request of Parent, (a) one or
more consent solicitations to the holders of outstanding loans, capital
markets debt securities or other indebtedness identified in Schedule 6.8(c) to
the 

 



-48-  Parent Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Specified Indebtedness_ "),
to waive any applicable change of control provisions, defaults or other
covenants that would apply in connection with, or otherwise restrict the
ability of the parties to consummate, the Merger as contemplated in this
Agreement (the " _Consent Solicitations_ ") and/or (b) an offer to purchase
any such Specified Indebtedness (the " _Debt Offers_ ") or as determined by
Parent in its discretion, in lieu of conducting a Debt Offer, if permitted by
the terms of such Specified Indebtedness, to issue a notice of optional
redemption to redeem such Specified Indebtedness pursuant to the terms
thereof or to take such other actions as may be permitted by the terms of such
Specified Indebtedness to satisfy and discharge such Specified Indebtedness
(the " _Debt Redemptions_ " and with the Consent Solicitations and Debt
Offers, the " _Debt Transactions_ "), in each case on the terms and conditions
specified by the Parent; _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to
commence any Debt Transaction until Parent shall have provided the Company
with the necessary consent solicitation statement, offer to purchase, related
letter of transmittal, supplemental indenture, redemption notice and other
related documents in connection therewith;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Parent shall consult with the Company regarding the timing of any Debt
Transaction in light of the regular financial reporting schedule of the
Company and the requirements of applicable Law. Parent shall afford the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review the material terms and conditions
of any Debt Transaction (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company).
Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, provide such cooperation as reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any Debt Transaction. Parent shall cause its counsel to
furnish any legal opinions required in connection with any Debt Transaction
other than those opinions relating to corporate matters with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and authorization, execution and delivery of the
applicable documents by the Company and its Subsidiaries, which opinions the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its counsel to provide.

(b) The provisions of Section 6.8(a) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in the foregoing Section 6.8(a) will
require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to
pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for which
it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or
on behalf of Parent, (ii) take any action or provide any information that will
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws,
including SEC rules and regulations, or would result in a violation or breach
of, or default under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound, or would result in the waiver of
any legal privilege, (iii) give indemnities that are effective prior to the
Effective Time for which it is not simultaneously indemnified by Parent, (iv)
pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of any
Debt Transaction or any definitive agreements with respect thereto that are
effective prior to the Effective Time, (v) deliver any certificate or take any
other action pursuant to this Section 6.8 or any other provision of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in personal liability
to a director, officer or other personnel or (vi) except as otherwise provided
in the final sentence of Section 6.8(a), deliver any legal opinion. In
addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or relating to any Debt
Transaction will be required to be effective until the Effective Time.

 



-49- (c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with any Debt
Transaction, including the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives contemplated by Section 6.8(a). Parent indemnifies and holds
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any Debt Transaction,
any information used in connection therewith or any assistance or activities
in connection therewith, except with respect to any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such persons. The provisions
of this Section 6.8(c) survive the termination of this Agreement.

6.9. _Information; Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Section 6.9,
the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), upon
reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders/shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy/Prospectus, the
Management Information Circular, the Registration Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon giving of reasonable notice by the other Party, afford the others
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours following reasonable advance notice throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees, agents, contracts,
books and records (including the work papers of such Partys independent
accountants upon receipt of any required consents from such accountants), as
well as properties, offices and other facilities, and, during such period,
each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the
other all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.9 shall require or be construed to require either the Company or
Parent to allow the other Party or its representatives to perform any on-site
procedures (including an on-site study) with respect to any property of the
Company or Parent (as applicable) or their respective Subsidiaries.

(b) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.9 and 6.21(b) shall not require
and shall not be construed to require either the Company or Parent to permit
any access to any of its (or any of its Subsidiaries) officers, employees,
agents, contracts, books or records, or its (or any of its Subsidiaries)
properties, offices or other facilities, or to permit any inspection, review,
sampling or audit, or to disclose or otherwise make available any information
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent (as applicable) would
(i) unreasonably disrupt the operations of such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third
parties or violate the terms of any confidentiality provisions in any
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement, (iii) result in a violation of applicable Laws, including any
fiduciary duty, (iv) waive the protection of any attorney-client or similar
privilege or (v) result in the disclosure of any personal information that
would expose the Company or Parent to the risk of liability. In the event that
Parent or the Company objects to any

 



-50-  request submitted pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 6.9 and
Section 6.21(b) and withholds information on the basis of the foregoing
clauses (i) through (v), the Company or the Parent, as applicable, shall
inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and
the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer
from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of reasonable
best efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party
required to provide such information and (B) implement appropriate
and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information
in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of
appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating applicable Law or confidentiality restriction or
jeopardizing such privilege. Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems
advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel Only Material" or with
similar restrictions. Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient or otherwise as
the restriction indicates, and be subject to any additional confidentiality or
joint defense agreement executed by the Company and Parent. All requests for
information made pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by the Company or Parent. All
information exchanged or made available shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) No exchange of information or investigation by Parent or its
representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, and
no investigation by the Company or its representatives shall affect or be
deemed to affect, modify or waive the representations and warranties of
Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement.

(d) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this Section 6.9 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending
or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the Parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement and under the joint defense doctrine. 

6.10. _Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE and the TSX, subject to official notice of issuance. To the extent
requested by Parent, prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under

 



-51-  applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting
by the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from the
NYSE and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten days after the Effective Time.

 

6.11. _Publicity_. Except (a) communications consistent with the final form of
joint press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation given
to investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger, (b) as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or (c) pursuant to the
Companys or Parents rights pursuant to Section 6.2, the Company and Parent
shall consult with each other, and provide meaningful opportunity for review
and give due consideration to reasonable comment by the other Party, prior
to issuing any press releases or other public written communications or
otherwise making planned public statements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including the
NYSE or the TSX) with respect thereto.

6.12. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Benefit Plans of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time. Parent agrees that each employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who continues to remain employed with
the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_
") shall:

(i) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, be provided with base salary or base
wage, as applicable, no less favorable than the base salary or base wage
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time,

(ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2017, be provided with target annual cash bonus opportunities and pension
and welfare benefits that are, in each case, no less favorable than those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time,

 

(iii) during the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, be provided with target annual cash bonus
opportunities, and pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and

 

(iv) solely to the extent that the Effective Time occurs prior to the
Companys ordinary course grant of equity awards in 2017, be provided with a
grant of Parent equity or equity-based awards in 2017 having a long-term
incentive award target value that is substantially comparable to that of the
awards granted by the Company to such employee in 2016; _provided_ that
the form or forms of equity and equity-based awards provided to each such
employee shall be the same form or forms of the awards and in the same
proportion provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (other than the
Continuing Employees).

 



-52- Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirements of the immediately preceding
sentence shall not limit any compensation or benefits required to be provided
to Continuing Employees (A) by applicable Law or (B) who are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement pursuant to such agreement. Without limiting
the two immediately preceding sentences, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
the Company to, provide to each Continuing Employee who is on Canadian payroll
and whose employment terminates during the 18-month period following the
Closing Date with severance benefits at least equal to the severance benefits
for which such Continuing Employee would have been eligible under the
Companys severance practices, as set forth in Section 6.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, determined (1) without taking into account any reduction
after the Closing in compensation paid to such Continuing Employee and (2)
taking into account each Continuing Employees service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and, after the Closing,
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
group health and welfare insurance plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be
waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents,
(ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for medical expenses incurred during such plan year prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) for purposes of
(A) vesting, (B) benefit accrual, (C) pay credit level in any cash balance or
similar plan, (D) level of subsidy by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for
any health or welfare plan, and (E) eligibility to participate, in each case,
under each applicable Parent Benefit Plan, as if such service had been
performed with Parent, except to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits or in the treatment of a Continuing Employee under such Parent
Benefit Plan that is more favorable than the treatment of a
similarly situated employee of Parent of the same age and with the same years
of service.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing at least
ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the
Company shall (i) cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and
arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide
that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence participation
therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such
Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation and (ii) subject to the
last sentence of this Section 6.12(c), cause the Spectra Energy Retirement
Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (A) the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time and (B) the Continuing Employees
shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Parent_  

 



-53-   _401(k) Plan_ "). Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions as may be required, including amendments to the
Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions to the
Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of
loans), Parent Common Stock or a combination thereof in an amount equal to the
full account balance distributed to such Continuing Employee from a Company
401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 6.12(c), if
Parent is not able to cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept rollover
contributions in the form of notes (in the case of loans) as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, then the Company shall not be required to
terminate the Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to this Section 6.12(c).

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Benefit Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may, with respect to
each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries actively employed as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and then participating in any
Benefit Plan that is an annual bonus plan (an " _Annual Bonus Plan_ "), upon
notice to and in consultation with Parent, determine the amount of each
employees pre-Closing bonus entitlement, which shall equal the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the employees full-year bonus entitlement under
all such Annual Bonus Plans for the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs, based on the greater of (A) deemed performance at "target"
levels and (B) actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to
the Effective Time, extrapolated through the end of such fiscal year,
and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which equals the number of days that
have elapsed during such fiscal year through the Effective Time and the
denominator of which equals 365 (each, a " _Pre-Closing Bonus Amount_ ").
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to
(1) provide each Continuing Employee an annual cash bonus opportunity under a
Benefit Plan that is an Annual Bonus Plan maintained by Parent or one of its
Affiliates for the balance of the 2017 calendar year in accordance with
Section 6.12(a)(ii) and (2) at the time annual cash bonuses for the 2017
calendar year are paid to similarly situated employees of Parent (other than
the Continuing Employees), pay to each Continuing Employee the sum of (x) his
or her Pre-Closing Bonus Amount and (y) the amount of such employees bonus
entitlement in respect of the portion of the 2017 calendar year following the
Effective Time. The Parties agree that the annual bonus payment in respect of
the 2017 calendar year shall, solely to the extent the bonus recipient is a
participant therein, be eligible for a matching contribution under, and shall
be counted towards pensionable earnings under, the applicable Benefit Plans of
the Company under which such payment would have been taken into account as of
the date hereof; _provided_ that the Company provides Parent with a list of
such Benefit Plans not later than 60 days after the date hereof.

(f) Prior to making any broad-based written communications to the officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to the Company
Equity Awards or compensation or benefit entitlements to be provided following
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable

 



-54-  period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company
shall consider any such comments in good faith. Not later than five Business
Days after the Companys dissemination of any written communication governed
by this Section 6.12(f), the Company shall provide Parent with a final copy of
such communication.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent agrees to continue or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue,
through the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Spectra Energy
Retiree Medical Plan (the " _Retiree Medical Plan_ ") on terms and conditions
no less favorable in duration, scope, value, participant cost, vesting and
otherwise than those in effect as of the Effective Time with respect to all
individuals who as of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time are
receiving benefits under the Retiree Medical Plan. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take the actions set forth in Section 6.12(g) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, (ii)
prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from
amending or terminating any of their Benefit Plans or, after the Effective
Time, any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the
Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or
(iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may
be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or under any Benefit Plan that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

6.13. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter to the contrary, none of
the Parties shall (and each Party shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not
to) take any action that would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or impede
the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) result in gain being recognized pursuant
to Section 367(a)(1) by Persons who are stockholders of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such stockholder that
would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) of Parent following the
Merger that does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the
form provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8), or (iii) cause
Parent to be treated as a "domestic corporation" pursuant to Section 7874(b)
of the Code as a result of the Merger.

 

(b) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with respect to Tax matters
relevant to integrating their respective Subsidiaries and operations.

 



-55- 6.14. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.8, Section 8.2(b)
or Section 8.2(c), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its
Representatives, shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense, except
that expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee in connection with
the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada), the Registration Statement and the
printing and mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus, the Management Information
Circular and the Registration Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in

effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or any of its

-63- (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) [ _Requisite
Company Vote Not Obtained_ ], and,

 

(A) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal involving the Company shall have been
publicly announced (and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
publicly withdrawn) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, and

(B) within 12 months after such termination, (1) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to
consummate an Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter consummated, or (2) an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise
consummated with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within 12
months of such termination (with "50%" being substituted in lieu of "15%" in
each instance thereof in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" for this
purpose), then prior to or concurrently with such consummation, or

(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(A) [ _Failure to Include Company
Recommendation_ ], Section 8.1(f)(B) [ _Change of Recommendation_ ] or Section
8.1(f)(C) [ _Failure to Recommend Against Tender or Exchange Offer_ ], then
promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the date of such
termination, or

(iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to 8.1(c)(i) [ _Requisite Company
Vote Not Obtained_ ], then, promptly, but in no event later than two Business
Days after the date of such termination, the Company shall, (x) in the case of
Section 8.2(b)(i) or Section 8.2(b)(ii), pay to Parent a termination fee of
$1,000,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") less the amount of any
reimbursements paid pursuant to the succeeding clause (y) of this paragraph in
each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent and further, (y) in the case of Section
8.2(b)(iii), the Company shall pay all of the reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses of Parent incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
an amount not to exceed $100,000,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement Cap_ "). In
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. The Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee
and any expense reimbursement (collectively, the " _Company Payments_ ") to
Parent free and clear and without withholding or deduction for U.S.
federal income Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by Law.
If the Company is required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account
of U.S. federal income Taxes under Section 881(a) of the Code from a Company
Payment, the Company will remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to
the applicable Governmental Entity and, except to the extent such Taxes are
attributable to Parents failure to provide the Company with a duly completed
and executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, the Company will be required to pay
additional amounts to Parent (the " _Company Additional Amounts_ ") as may be
necessary so that the net amount received by Parent (including the Company
Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount Parent would have received if the Taxes had not been so

 



-64-  withheld or deducted. Furthermore the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on Parent under
Section 881(a) of the Code (together with any interest and penalties and
expenses paid or payable by Parent with respect thereto) with respect to the
receipt of a Company Payment other than Taxes in respect of which amounts have
been fully deducted and remitted and Company Additional Amounts have been
paid. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from
the applicable U.S. Governmental Entity of any Taxes in respect of which the
Company has paid a Company Additional Amount or indemnified Parent (or, if
such refund cannot be obtained, to claim a credit for such Taxes). Parent
shall promptly pay the amount of any such refund or credit obtained to the
Company, net of any costs, Taxes and expenses borne by Parent with respect to
such refund or credit. The Company agrees to pay the amount of any expenses
incurred by Parent in the process of applying for and obtaining such refund or
credit. The obligations described in the foregoing will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of this Agreement.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) [
_Requisite Parent Vote Not Obtained_ ], and,

 

(A) (x) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal involving Parent shall have been
publicly announced (and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been
publicly withdrawn) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of
the Parent Shareholders Meeting, and

(B) within 12 months after such termination, (1) Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement to
consummate an Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter consummated, or (2) an Acquisition Proposal is otherwise
consummated with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries within 12 months
of such termination (with "50%" being substituted in lieu of "15%" in each
instance thereof in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" for this
purpose), then prior to or concurrently with such consummation, or

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(A) [ _Failure to Include
Parent Recommendation_ ], Section 8.1(g)(B) [ _Change of Recommendation_ ], or
Section 8.1(g)(C) [ _Failure to Recommend Against Tender or Exchange Offer_ ],
then promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after the date of
such termination, or

(iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) [ _Requisite
Parent Vote Not Obtained_ ], then promptly, but in no event later than two
Business Days after the date of such termination,

Parent shall, (x) in the case of Section 8.2(c)(i) or Section 8.2(c)(ii), pay
to the Company a termination fee of CAN$1,750,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") less the amount of any reimbursements paid pursuant to
the succeeding clause (y) of this paragraph to the Company in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to account designated in writing
by the Company and further, (y) in the case of Section 8.2(c)(iii), Parent
shall pay all of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the
Company incurred by the Company and any of its

 



-65-  Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed the Expense
Reimbursement Cap. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For purposes of Section 8.2(c)(i),
with respect to Parent, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall also be deemed
to include the acquisition by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, of a third party or the acquisition by a third party of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a merger (including a triangular merger),
consolidation, share exchange, amalgamation, scheme of arrangement,
reorganization or other extraordinary transaction where, in each case, the
shareholders of Parent immediately prior to the completion of such transaction
own (beneficially or of record), in the aggregate, less than 65% of the
common equity of Parent or the Person that is the ultimate parent company
resulting from such transaction. Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee
and any expense reimbursement (collectively, the " _Parent Payments_ ") to
the Company free and clear and without withholding or deduction for Taxes
unless such withholding or deduction is required by Law. If Parent is required
to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from a Parent
Payment, Parent will remit the full amount so withheld and deducted to the
applicable Governmental Entity and Parent will be required to pay additional
amounts to the Company (the " _Parent Additional Amounts_ ") as may be
necessary so that the net amount received by the Company (including the
Parent Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction is not less
than the amount the Company would have received if the Taxes had not been so
withheld or deducted. Furthermore Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company from the full amount of any Taxes imposed on the Company under
Part XIII of the ITA (together with any interest and penalties and expenses
paid or payable by the Company with respect thereto) with respect to the
receipt of a Parent Payment other than Taxes in respect of which amounts have
been fully deducted and remitted and Parent Additional Amounts have been paid.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund from

acknowledge that in the event that the Company Termination Fee or
Parent Termination

 



-66-  Fee becomes payable by, and is paid by, the Company, or becomes payable by,
and is paid by, Parent, such fee shall be the receiving Partys and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates sole and exclusive remedy for any loss, cost,
liability or expense relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , no such
payment shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages to the other
Parties resulting from any Willful Breach by such Party of this Agreement.

Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2016, between Parent and the

among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and representations and
warranties, whether oral or written, with respect to such matters

 

9.9. _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2(d), all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar

shall not be a liability of holders of Shares.

 



-82- 9.10. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Parent and the Company hereby agree that
their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than Parent,
the Company, the Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns any rights or remedies, express or
implied, hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, except the rights
of third party beneficiaries as are expressly provided in Section 6.15 [
_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_] and Section 6.20 [
_Governance and Other Matters_ ], which shall not arise until after the
Effective Time. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with Section 9.2 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.11. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and,
after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Any obligation of one Party to
another Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied
or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

 

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in
any other jurisdiction.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. All article,
section, subsection, schedule, annex and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, subsections, schedules, annexes
and exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The exhibits,
schedules and annexes attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this
Agreement and are incorporated in this Agreement for all purposes.

 



-83- (b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa. The words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including
without limitation," the words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and
similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not any particular section or article in which such words appear and any
reference to a Law shall include any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and any reference to any Law in this Agreement shall only be
a reference to such Law as of the date of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
specified, currency amounts referenced in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are in U.S. Dollars.

 

(c) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Unless otherwise
specified, time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or
act is to be done shall be calculated by excluding the day on which the period
commences and including the day on which the period ends. Whenever any action
must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then such
action may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day. The
word "extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement
shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such word
or phrase shall not merely mean "if."

 

(d) All accounting terms used in this Agreement and not expressly defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP. 

(e) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

(f) The Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter may include
items and information the disclosure of which is not required either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision of this
Agreement or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Article IV or Article V or to one or more covenants contained in
Article VI. Certain matters are or may be listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter for informational purposes only and may
not be required to be listed by the terms of this Agreement. Inclusion of any
items or information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to be an acknowledgement or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material" or that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have either a Material Adverse Effect 

 



-84-  or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement
or is outside the ordinary course of business. No disclosure in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as: (a) an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists, has actually
occurred or will actually occur; (b) an admission of any liability or
obligation of any Party or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any third
Person; or (c) an admission against the interest of any Party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third Person.

 

9.14. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights
or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law
or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

duly authorized officers of the parties to this Agreement as of the date
