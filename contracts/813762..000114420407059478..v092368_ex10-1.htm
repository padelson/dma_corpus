group of which PSC is  a  member (the " _Common  Parent Group_ ")  shall 
include the income of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries on the Common 
Parent  Group's consolidated federal income Tax Return for all periods
through the  Closing Date and pay any federal income Taxes attributable to
such income.  For  all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
the Common Parent  Group shall cause the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to

and, in jurisdictions  requiring separate reporting from the Common Parent
Group, to file separate  company state and local income tax returns. All such

Common Parent Group as reasonably  requested by the Common Parent Group to

the Closing, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary  shall be bound
thereby or have any rights or liability thereunder.

transfer, value added, stock  transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer,
recording, registration and other  fees  and any similar Taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
(together with any related interest, penalties  or  additions to Tax) shall
be borne equally between PSC and Buyer.

 

 

(d) _Elections_.  PSC  shall make any election requested by Buyer to enable
the Buyer to receive,  to  the extent possible, for federal income tax
purposes, a carryover basis equal  to  PSC's basis in the Metals Stock as of
the Closing Date as a result of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

20  

 

 

 

 

 

**ARTICLE  X**

 

 

**INDEMNIFICATION**

 

 

10.1 _Indemnification  by Arnos_.  Arnos  agrees to indemnify Buyer, its
Affiliates and their respective officers,  directors, employees, independent
contractors, stockholders, principals,  partners, agents, or representatives
(other than Carl Icahn and his Affiliates  other than American Property
Investors, Inc. and its controlled Affiliates  (each  an " _Indemnified 
Person_ " and  collectively, the " _Indemnified  Persons_ ")  against, and
to hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all (i)  Losses
incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person relating to or arising  out 
of or in connection with (a) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any 
representation or warranty made by PSC or the Corporation in this Agreement 
other than any breaches of or inaccuracies contained in any representation 
or  warranty contained in Section 4.8 (for purposes of the representations
and  warranties contained in Section 3.8(b), the existence of any breach and
the  amount of any Taxes arising or resulting therefrom will be determined
without  regard to any disclosures by the Company or any Subsidiary set forth
on Schedule  3.8), or (b) any breach of or failure by PSC to perform any of
its covenants  or  obligations set out or contemplated in this Agreement and
(ii) Losses incurred  or suffered by any Indemnified Person relating to or
arising out of or in  connection with any Environmental Claim to the extent
that the same is based  upon, or arises out of, any Pre-Closing Environmental
Liabilities.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained
herein, the aggregate  liability of Arnos for any and all obligations under
this Agreement shall  in no  event exceed the Purchase Price received by
PSC.

 

 

10.2 _Claims_.  As  promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim for  indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Person shall promptly  give  notice to Arnos of such claim and the amount
the Indemnified Person will  be  entitled to receive hereunder from Arnos;
provided that the failure of the  Indemnified Person to promptly give notice
shall not relieve Arnos of its  obligations except to the extent (if any)
that Arnos shall have been prejudiced  thereby. If Arnos does not object in
writing to such indemnification claim  within 30 days of receiving notice
thereof, the Indemnified Person shall  be  entitled to recover, on the
thirty-fifth day after such notice was given,  from  Arnos the amount of
such claim, and no later objection by Arnos shall be  permitted; if Arnos
agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but  objects  that it is
obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the Indemnified Person  shall 
nevertheless be entitled to recover, on the thirty-fifth day after such
notice  was given, from Arnos the lesser amount, without prejudice to the
Indemnified  Person's claim for the difference. In addition to the amounts
recoverable by the  Indemnified Person from Arnos pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, the  Indemnified Person shall also be entitled to recover from
Arnos interest  on such  amounts at the rate of Two Times Prime from, and
including, the thirty-fifth  day  after such notice of an indemnification
claim is given to, but not including,  the date such recovery is actually
made by the Indemnified Person.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

10.3 _Notice  of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_.  The 
Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably
practicable  to  Arnos of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit, action  or  proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto (a "
_Third  Party Claim_ ")  in  respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Agreement; provided that  the  failure of the Indemnified Person to
promptly give notice shall not relieve  Arnos of its obligations except to
the extent (if any) that Arnos shall have  been prejudiced thereby. Arnos
may, at its own expense, participate in the  defense of any Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding (a) upon  notice to the Indemnified Person
and (b) upon delivery by Arnos to the  Indemnified Person a written agreement
that the Indemnified Person is entitled  to indemnification for all Losses
arising out of such Third Party Claim,  suit,  action or proceeding and that
Arnos shall be liable for the entire amount  of any  Loss, at any time
during the course of any such Third Party Claim, suit,  action  or
proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that (i) Arnos's 
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and (ii) Arnos 
shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified 
Person's reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with
respect  to such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding. If Arnos
assumes such  defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not
the duty) to  participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at
its own expense,  separate from the counsel employed by Arnos. If, however,
the Indemnified  Person  reasonably determines in its judgment that
representation by Arnos's counsel of  both Arnos and the Indemnified Person
would present such counsel with a conflict  of interest, then such
Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to  represent or defend it in
any such Third Party Claim, action, suit or proceeding  and Arnos shall pay
all of the fees and disbursements in connection with  the  retention of such
separate counsel. If Arnos fails to promptly notify the  Indemnified Party
that Arnos desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant,  or if Arnos
gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently  or settle
the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the  right  to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of Arnos, the Third Party Claim by 
all  appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the
Indemnified  Person in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the
Indemnified  Person (with the consent of Arnos, which consent will not be
unreasonably  withheld). The Indemnified Person will have full control of
such defense  and  proceedings, including any compromise or settlement
thereof. Whether or not  Arnos chooses to defend or prosecute any such Third
Party Claim, suit, action  or  proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or  prosecution thereof.

 

 

10.4 _Settlement  or Compromise_.  Any  settlement or compromise made or
caused to be made by the Indemnified Person  or  Arnos, of any claim, suit,
action or proceeding shall also be binding upon  Arnos  or the Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a  final  judgment or
decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction  in the  amount
of such settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, that  no 
obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person 
as a  result of such settlement without its prior written consent. The
Indemnified  Person will give Arnos at least thirty (30) days notice of any
proposed  settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or
proceeding  it  is defending, during which time Arnos may reject such
proposed settlement  or  compromise; provided, however, that from and after
such rejection, Arnos  shall  be obligated to assume the defense of and full
and complete liability and  responsibility for such Third Party Claim, suit,
action or proceeding and  any  and all Losses in connection therewith in
excess of the amount of  unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person
would have been obligated  to  pay under the proposed settlement or
compromise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

10.5 _Failure  of Arnos to Act_.  In the  event that Arnos does not assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit,  action or proceeding brought
against an Indemnified Person, then any failure  of  the Indemnified Person
to defend or to participate in the defense of any  such  Third Party Claim,
suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be  done,  shall not
relieve Arnos of any of its obligations under this  Agreement.

 

 

10.6 _Tax  Character_.  Arnos,  PSC and Buyer agree that any payments
pursuant to this Article X will be  treated  for federal and state income
tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase  Price,  and that they will
report such payments on all Tax Returns consistently with  such
characterization.

 

 

10.7 _Sole  and Exclusive Remedy_.  The  indemnification remedy provided to
the Indemnified Persons under this Article  X  shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy to which the Buyer and each other  Indemnified Person shall
be entitled after the Closing for any breach of  any  representation or
warranty or any covenant by PSC or the Corporation under  this  Agreement.
The representations and warranties of PSC, the Corporation, Buyer  and  IEH
contained in Articles II, III, IV and V of this Agreement may have been 
made  for the purposes of allocating risks among the parties to this
Agreement,  and  such representations and warranties shall not confer, and
shall not be deemed  to  confer, any personal liability on any director,
officer or employee of any  party  to this Agreement.
