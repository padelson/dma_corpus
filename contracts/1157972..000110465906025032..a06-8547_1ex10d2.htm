## 1.3 _Cash and Debt at Closing_.

  



  

### (a) Immediately prior to the Closing, except as provided in _Section
1.3(b)_ , the Sellers will cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to
use cash and cash equivalents then held by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to repay the outstanding principal, interest and other amounts
due under the Funded Debt (the remainder of such amounts due under the Funded
Debt will be repaid at the Closing as described in _Section 1.2(b)(i)_ ).
Accordingly, the Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that it is their
intent that at and as of the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will have only the cash and cash equivalents contemplated by
_Section 1.3(b)_, and, after the payments contemplated by _Section
1.2(b)(i)_ , there will be no outstanding principal, interest or other
amounts due under the Funded Debt and all Liens associated with the Funded
Debt will be released.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Sellers shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
have, as of the close of business on the last Business Day preceding the
Closing Date, cash balances in the bank accounts of the Company Subsidiaries
referred to in _Section 1.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
aggregating not less than $1,000,000, using the conversion ratios of local
currencies into U.S. dollars as of the close of business on the last Business
Day **** preceding the Closing Date. Within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to
deliver to the Stockholder Representative a bank statement for each bank
account specified in _Section 1.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as of
the close of business on the last day preceding the Closing Date on which the
applicable bank was open for business and the conversion ratios of local
currencies into U.S. dollars for the relevant local currencies as of
the close of business on the day preceding the date such bank statements
are deposited for delivery to the Stockholder Representative (the "
_Adjustment Date Conversion Ratios_ "). In the event that the aggregate cash
balance set forth on such bank statements (net of any overdrafts after
application of _Section 1.2(b)(i)_ ) (the " _Aggregate Balance Amount_ ")
exceeds $1,000,000 using the Adjustment Date Conversion Ratios (the amount by
which the Aggregate Balance Amount exceeds such amount, the " _Positive Bank
Cash Difference Amount_ "), the Purchaser shall concurrently with the
delivery of such bank statements pay to the Sellers the amount, in U.S.
dollars, of the Positive Bank Cash Difference Amount, up to a maximum of
$1,000,000. In the event that the Aggregate Balance Amount is less than
$1,000,000 using the Adjustment Date Conversion Ratios (the amount by which
the Aggregate Balance Amount is less than such amount, the " _Negative Bank
Cash Difference Amount_ "), the Sellers shall within two (2) Business Days
after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of such bank statements and
conversion ratios pay to the Purchaser the amount, in U.S. dollars, of the
Negative Bank Cash Difference Amount. The amounts, if any, to be paid by or to
the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 1.3(b)_ shall be paid by or to
each Seller in the

  



        
   

  



  

### proportion that the number of Shares owned by such Seller immediately
prior to the Closing bears to the number of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing and shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

## 1.4 _Indemnity and Earnout Escrow_. At the Closing, in accordance with
_Section 1.2(b)(vi)_, the Purchaser will pay the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Deposit to the Escrow Agent, under an escrow agreement to be entered
into on the Closing Date by the Sellers, the Company, the Stockholder
Representative, the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent in substantially the form
attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Agreement_ "). The Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Deposit, together with any
interest and income earned thereon (collectively, the " _Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Funds_ "), will be held until the last to occur of June 30,
2007 or the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Period_ ") to serve as an escrow fund for: (i) any
indemnifiable losses resulting from breaches of the Sellers representations
and warranties and covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement,
pursuant to _Article VII_; and (ii) satisfaction of the Sellers
obligations, if any, with respect to the Earnout Obligations (as described in
_Section 1.6_). Interest and income earned on the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Funds shall be applied first to satisfy any fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent under the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, and the amount
of any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent under the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Agreement that exceed the amount of such interest and income earned on
the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds will be paid directly by
the Purchaser. At the end of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, the
remaining amount of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds, less: (i) any
amounts subject to a pending Purchaser indemnification claim (including
claims with respect to a Multiple Source of Recovery Matter under _Section
7.6(b)_ ); and (ii) any then outstanding fees and expenses of the Escrow
Agent (but not in excess of the interest and income earned on the Indemnity
and Earnout Escrow Funds which are then held as part of the Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Funds), shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 1.5 _Retention Program Escrow_. Immediately upon the Companys receipt of
the payment contemplated by _Section 1.2(b)(vii)_, the Purchaser will cause
the Company to pay the Retention Program Escrow Deposit to the Escrow Agent,
under an escrow agreement to be entered into on the Closing Date by and among
the Sellers, the Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Purchaser and
the Escrow Agent in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto
(the " _Retention Program Escrow Agreement_ "). The Retention Program Escrow
Deposit, together with any interest and income earned thereon (collectively,
the " _Retention Program Escrow Funds_ "), will be held from the Closing
until the fifth (5th) Business Day after the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Retention Program Escrow Period_ ") to serve as an
escrow fund for the satisfaction of the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries obligations, if any, with respect to the Retention Program (as
described in _Section 5.9(c)_). The Retention Program Escrow Agreement
shall provide for the Company or its designee to have authority to draw funds
to make payments on the Retention Program upon delivery of an officers
certificate of Purchaser confirming funds are being used in compliance with
the Retention Program. Interest and income earned on the Retention Program
Escrow Funds shall be applied first to satisfy any fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent under the Retention Program Escrow Agreement, and the amount of
any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent under the Retention Program Escrow
Agreement that exceed the amount of such interest and income earned on the
Retention Program Escrow Funds will be paid directly by the Purchaser. At the
end of the Retention Program Escrow Period, the remaining amount of the

  



        
   

  



  

## Retention Program Escrow Funds, if any, less any then outstanding fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent (but not in excess of the interest and
income earned on the Retention Program Escrow Funds which are then held as
part of the Retention Program Escrow Funds), shall be disbursed by the Escrow
Agent (on behalf of the Company) to the Sellers in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Retention Program Escrow Agreement. Any such amount
paid to the Sellers shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an increase to
the Purchase Price.

  

## 

  

## 1.6 _Treatment of Earnout Obligations_.

  



  

### (a) The parties agree and acknowledge that, pursuant to Section 1.8 of
the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement, Aircast Intermediate Holdco and Aircast
US Opco (collectively, with the successors and assigns of either or both of
them, the " _Earnout Obligors_ ") have the obligation to make certain
payments to Old Aircast Inc. and Old Aircast LLC or their respective assigns
(collectively, the " _Old Aircast Sellers_ ") upon the satisfaction of
conditions specified therein relating to the financial performance of Aircast
Intermediate Holdco and its Subsidiaries during the time periods specified
therein, in each case on the terms and conditions set forth therein (any such
obligations, the " _Earnout Obligations_ "). The Purchaser and the Sellers
agree that, except to the extent due or owing (at any time) for the 2005
fiscal year or accelerated as described in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_ or _Section
1.6(f)_ , the Earnout Obligors will remain responsible for the Earnout
Obligations and all Earnout-Related Costs; _provided, however,_ that the
Sellers will pay to Aircast Intermediate Holdco or its designee(s) on behalf
of the Earnout Obligors: (i) eighty percent (80%) of the aggregate amount
paid to the Old Aircast Sellers in complete and final settlement and release
of the Earnout Obligations (the " _Settlement Payment_ ") and any Earnout-
Related Costs related thereto if such settlement occurs within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date; or (ii) ninety percent (90%) of the aggregate of
any payout to the Old Aircast Sellers under the Earnout Obligations and any
Settlement Payment (if the settlement occurs after the ninetieth (90th) day
after the Closing Date) and any related Earnout-Related Costs (such eighty
percent (80%) or ninety percent (90%) share of the Settlement Payment and
Earnout-Related Costs, each the " _Sellers  Share_") and _provided further,
however_  that any Earnout-Related Costs arising from or related to any
failure by the Earnout Obligors to comply with any provision of Section 1.8
of the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement after the Closing, as more fully set
forth in _Section 1.6(b)_ , will not be included in the calculation of the
Sellers Share for purposes of this _Section 1.6(a)_.

  

### 

  

### (b) Unless and until the Earnout Obligations are settled or accelerated
and paid as set forth in this _Section 1.6_ , from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
Earnout Obligors and the Purchasers other Subsidiaries to comply with all of
the obligations set forth in Section 1.8 of the Aircast Asset Purchase
Agreement relating to the Earnout Obligations, including: (i) the obligation
set forth in Section 1.8(c) of the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement to
determine the "Net Sales" for each subsequent "Earnout Year" on a
_pro forma_ basis to remove the effects upon the calculation of the
actual "Net Sales" for each such "Earnout Year" of the "Change of Control"
resulting from the Closing hereunder (the quoted terms in this sentence have
the respective meanings set forth in the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement);
and (ii) the obligation to pay to the Old Aircast Sellers any amounts that
are required to be paid by the Earnout Obligors to the Old Aircast Sellers
from time to time with respect to the Earnout Obligations, in accordance with
the applicable terms and conditions of the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement
or pursuant to a Settlement Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) After the Closing, the Purchaser will use commercially reasonable
best efforts to deliver to the Stockholder Representative approximately
thirty (30) days prior to the "Earnout Audit Completion Date" (as defined in
the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement) (or, in the case of a "Change of
Control", prior to the date that is thirty (30) days following the closing
thereof) a draft calculation of the "Net Sales" for the preceding fiscal year
ended December 31 (or, in the case of a "Change of Control," for the twelve
(12) month period ended on the prior month end). The Stockholder
Representative shall have fifteen (15) days to review and update the draft
calculation and shall, at or before the end of such fifteen (15) day period,
provide the Purchaser with any written objections to the Purchasers draft
calculation and, if applicable, with the Stockholder Representatives
own calculation of "Net Sales" for the appropriate period. If the Stockholder
Representative fails to provide any written objection by the end of such
fifteen (15) day period, then the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed
to have irrevocably agreed that the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries complied
with _Section 1.6(b)_ with respect to such calculation.

  

### 

  

### (d) As between the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and, after
the Closing, the Earnout Obligors, on the other, both prior to and after the
Closing, the Sellers will control the negotiation and consummation of any
settlement of the Earnout Obligations (with the Sellers being represented for
this purpose by the Stockholder Representative); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that (i) the Purchaser shall be afforded a reasonable period of time, and in
any event not less than five (5) Business Days, to review the terms and
conditions of any such settlement; and (ii) the consummation of any such
settlement shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Purchaser
unless such settlement includes a complete release with respect to the
Earnout Obligations of the Earnout Obligors by the Old Aircast Sellers.
The Purchaser acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 1.6_ , the Sellers shall only be obligated to negotiate in good
faith to pursue a settlement of the Earnout Obligations, but there can be no
assurance that such a settlement will be reached, and except for their
payment obligations under this _Section 1.6_ , the Sellers will have no
liability to the Purchaser or any other Person for the failure to reach such
a settlement. During such settlement negotiation process, the Stockholder
Representative will keep the Purchaser informed, on a reasonably prompt basis
and in reasonable detail, concerning the progress of such negotiations,
including: (x) providing the Purchaser with copies of any draft term sheets,
settlement agreements and other documents being circulated among the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives, on the one hand, and the
Old Aircast Sellers and their representatives, on the other hand; (y)
providing reasonable advance notice to the Purchaser (to the extent that
reasonable advance notice has been provided to the
Stockholder Representative) of any teleconferences and meetings between the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives, on the one hand, and the
Old Aircast Sellers and their representatives, on the other hand, that are
part of the settlement negotiation process; and (z) requesting release of the
Purchaser from the Earnout Obligations. The Purchaser will be permitted by
the Sellers and the Stockholder Representative to attend and participate in
any such teleconferences and meetings, assuming that the Old Aircast Sellers
do not object directly to the Purchaser to such attendance and participation.

  

### 

  

### (e) The consummation of any settlement of the Earnout Obligations
pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ (the " _Settlement Closing_ ") will occur after
the Closing Date at such date and time during normal business hours on a
Business Day as are determined by the Stockholder Representative and the Old
Aircast Sellers. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Stockholder
Representative has reached an agreement in principle to settle the Earnout
Obligations with the Old Aircast Sellers, but in any event not less than five
(5) Business Days prior to the anticipated date of consummation of the
Settlement Closing, the Stockholder Representative shall provide to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Purchaser written notice of such anticipated Settlement Closing, which
shall include the date, time and place of the Settlement Closing and a copy
of the settlement agreement evidencing such settlement (the form of which
shall have been previously agreed to by the Old Aircast Sellers) (the "
_Settlement Agreement_ "). At the Settlement Closing; (i) the Purchaser shall
cause the Earnout Obligors to execute and deliver the Settlement Agreement
(if not previously executed); (ii) the Sellers shall pay to
Aircast Intermediate Holdco or its designee(s) the Sellers Share and (iii)
the Purchaser shall cause the Settlement Payment and any Earnout-Related
Costs to be paid to the Old Aircast Sellers. The Sellers Share shall be
paid: (x) by release from the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds (if the
Settlement Closing occurs on or prior to the end of the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Period and to the extent there are sufficient Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Funds, as of the Settlement Closing, to satisfy each Sellers portion
of the Sellers Share); and (y) solely to the extent that the Settlement
Closing occurs after the end of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period or to
the extent that the Sellers Share exceeds the then-available Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Funds, by payment by the Sellers of such remaining part of the
Sellers Share, by inter-bank transfer or wire transfer of immediately
available funds, or in such other form as the Purchaser may agree, to Aircast
Intermediate Holdco or its designee(s).

  

### 

  

### (f) If the Earnout Obligors are unable to determine, prior to a time
reasonably in advance of the Closing, whether the Earnout Obligations would
be accelerated as a result of the consummation of the Stock Purchase, then
after the Closing the Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to deliver to the Stockholder Representative a draft calculation of
the "Net Sales" for the twelve (12) month period ended on the calendar month-
end next preceding the Closing Date (the " _Twelve Month Calculation_ "). The
Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to deliver the
draft Twelve Month Calculation prior to the date that is thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date. The Stockholder Representative shall have fifteen
(15) days to review and update the draft Twelve Month Calculation and shall,
at or before the end of the applicable review period, provide the Purchaser
with any written objections to the Purchasers draft Twelve Month
Calculation, and, if applicable, with the Stockholder Representatives own
calculations of "Net Sales" for such period. If the Stockholder Representative
fails to provide any written objection by the end of such fifteen (15) day
period, then the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have
irrevocably agreed that the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries complied with
_Section 1.6(b)_ with respect to the Twelve Month Calculation.  If the
Earnout Obligations accelerate as a result of the consummation of the Stock
Purchase, the Sellers shall pay to Aircast Intermediate Holdco or its
designee(s) (on behalf of the Purchaser) the amount of the Earnout
Obligations so accelerated at the time that payment is required to made by
the Earnout Obligors to the Old Aircast Sellers.

  

### 

  

### (g) To the extent reasonably necessary for any settlement negotiations
related to the Earnout Obligations continuing after the Closing or for
purposes related to the payments or calculations contemplated by _Section
1.6(c)_ and _Section 1.6(f)_ , the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to) provide to the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives reasonable access to the books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries reasonably related to the
calculation of "Net Sales" as described in _Section 1.6(b)_ , and make
available the personnel, accountants and other advisors of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (and their respective books and records reasonably
related to the calculation of "Net Sales" as described in _Section 1.6(b)_ ,
except to the extent subject to attorney-client privilege that would be
waived by such provision), in each case (I) as is reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative in connection with the settlement negotiation
process, (II) at the location of the

  



        
   

  



  

### Earnout Obligors, as applicable, (III) during normal business hours, (IV)
upon reasonable advance notice and (V) subject to any reasonable
confidentiality and securities trading restrictions imposed by the Purchaser
and delivered to the Stockholder Representative in writing a reasonable
amount of time prior to the provision of such access.

  

### 

  

### (h) All references in this _Section 1.6_ to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall also apply to any successor to, or assignee of,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (i) Any amount paid by the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as a reduction to the Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

### (j) Except as set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_ and this _Section 1.6_ ,
and except for breaches of Section 1.8 of the Aircast Asset Purchase
Agreement occurring prior to the Closing, the Sellers will have no
responsibility, financial or otherwise, for any Earnout Obligations or any
costs or expenses incurred in connection therewith.

  

### 

  

### (k) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this
_Section 1.6_ is intended to or shall limit or restrict the right of the
Purchaser to operate its, the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries business
in such a manner as it may determine in the Purchasers sole discretion after
the Closing (including the disposition of assets or properties as it may
elect).

  

### 

  

## 1.7 _Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

### (a) Each Seller has designated and appointed the Stockholder
Representative as the representative and attorney in fact of such Seller for
the sole purpose of acting on its behalf with respect to this Agreement, the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, the Retention Program Escrow
Agreement and any other document entered into in connection herewith or
therewith, including full power and authority on behalf of such Seller: (i)
to take all actions the Stockholder Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the pre-closing covenants of the Sellers set
forth in this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions
under this Agreement, including exercise of the powers, authority and
discretion conferred on the Sellers hereunder to waive any terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to give and receive notices; (ii) to take
all actions the Stockholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with negotiating, settling, compromising and otherwise handling
the Earnout Obligations; (iii) to take all actions the Stockholder
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the
Retention Program and the Retention Program Escrow Agreement; (iv) to take
all actions the Stockholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with the Sale Bonus Program; (v) to take all actions the
Stockholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with
the post-closing implementation of this Agreement and the Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Agreement, including negotiating, settling, compromising and
otherwise handling any claims for indemnification made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect to the Sellers representations and warranties
set forth in _Article II_ and covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement (including authorizing the delivery to the Purchaser of all or any
portion of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds in satisfaction of any such
indemnification claim), pursuing or responding to litigation and complying
with orders of courts with respect to any such indemnification claims; and
(vi) to take all other actions the Stockholder Representative deems necessary
or appropriate for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) The Purchaser shall be entitled to conclusively rely on all
statements, representations and decisions of the Stockholder Representative
as those of the Sellers, without any independent investigation or
verification.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Stockholder Representative is dissolved, resigns from such
position, files for bankruptcy or is the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy
petition that is not dismissed within thirty (30) days after filing, it shall
designate a replacement Stockholder Representative prior to such dissolution,
resignation or bankruptcy or, if the Stockholder Representative shall fail to
do so, a replacement Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by TWCP.
If the Stockholder Representative fails to so appoint a successor Stockholder
Representative in the manner described above and TWCP also fails to appoint a
successor Stockholder Representative within thirty (30) days after the
dissolution, resignation or bankruptcy of the Stockholder Representative, the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Agreement and the Retention Program Escrow Agreement requiring the consent or
action of the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to be require the
consent or action of all of the Sellers. Any change in the Stockholder
Representative shall be effective only upon delivery to the Purchaser of
written notice thereof either from the Stockholder Representative or TWCP, as
applicable.

been obligated to contribute, to an Employee Plan which is a "multiemployer
plan" (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or has
since the formation or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries maintained a
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA). No Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been
sponsored or contributed to by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate since the formation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any
liability to the PBGC other than for premiums not yet due and no event or
condition exists which could reasonably be expected to result in liability to
the Purchaser under Title IV of ERISA including by virtue of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary being considered a "single employer" with any other
entity (within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the
Code). No reportable event, or event or condition which presents a material
risk of termination by the PBGC, has occurred with respect to any Employee
Plan or any retirement plan of an ERISA Affiliate applicable to current or
former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, which, in
each case, is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (c) All contributions and premiums required to be made under the terms of
any Employee Plan or by a plan maintained by an ERISA Affiliate or as
required by applicable Law have been timely made or have been properly
recorded on the books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any such plan. The current value of the assets of each
such Employee Plan, as of the end of the most recently

  



        
   

  



  

### ended plan year of that Employee Plan, equals or exceeded the current
value of all benefits liabilities under that Employee Plan. No Employee Plan
nor any party in interest with respect to such Employee Plan has engaged in a
transaction that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company directly
or indirectly to liability under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA. No Employee Plan provides for continuing welfare benefits
or coverage for any participant or beneficiary or covered dependent of a
participant after the applicable participants termination of employment,
except to the extent required by applicable state insurance laws and Title I,
Part 6 of ERISA.  No Welfare Plan is (i) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement"(within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) or (ii) a
"voluntary employees beneficiary association" (within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code) or other funding arrangement for the provision of
welfare benefits (to the extent any Welfare Plan is listed in _Section
2.14(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to this sentence,
such disclosure shall include the amount of any such funding).  Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is bound by any
collective bargaining agreement or similar agreement to maintain or
contribute to any Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
material respect in a violation of applicable Law, each pension, retirement,
health, life, disability, severance and other welfare plan which is
maintained by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and which is
exempt from ERISA by reason of Section 4(b)(4) thereof (each, a " _Foreign
Plan_ ") is, and has been, established, registered for tax purposes (where
required) with the applicable Governmental Authority, qualified, administered
and funded (where required) in compliance with the terms thereof and all
applicable Laws. With respect to each Foreign Plan, all required filings and
reports have been made, in all material respects, in a timely and complete
manner with all Governmental Authorities. All obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to or under the Foreign Plans (whether pursuant to the
terms thereof or any applicable Laws) have been, to the extent required under
applicable Law or the terms of such Foreign Plans, satisfied in all material
respects, and there are no outstanding material defaults or material
violations thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.  Full
payment has been made, in all material respects, in a timely manner of all
amounts which are required to be made as contributions, payments or premiums
to or in respect of any Foreign Plan under applicable Law or under
the applicable Foreign Plan or any agreement relating to a Foreign Plan, and
no material excise taxes, penalties or punitive fees are owing or assessable
under any such Foreign Plan. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no event has
occurred with respect to any Foreign Plan registered with an applicable Tax
Authority which would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of
such registration of such Foreign Plan, or which would entitle any
Governmental Authority (without the consent of the sponsor of such Foreign
Plan) to wind up or terminate any such Foreign Plan, in whole or in part, or
could otherwise reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the tax
status of any such Foreign Plan. **** No contribution holidays have
been taken under any of the Foreign Plans, and there have been no withdrawals
of assets or transfers of assets from any Foreign Plan, except in accordance
with applicable Laws.

  

### 

  

### (e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will reasonably be
expected to: (i) entitle any employee, consultant, director, officer, limited
liability company manager or managing director (or functional equivalents of
the foregoing) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment; or (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting other than as required by Law or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee,

  



        
   

  



  

### consultant, director, officer, limited liability company manager or
managing director (or functional equivalents of the foregoing). Within the
twelve (12) month period preceding the date hereof, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has taken any action to entitle, and the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries do not owe, any employee, director, officer, limited
liability company manager or managing director (or functional equivalents of
the foregoing) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries any
severance pay or other compensation that has not been paid, will not be paid
on or prior to the Closing Date, or will not have been properly recorded on
the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (f) There is no Proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened in writing, other than routine claims for benefits, concerning any
Employee Plan or Foreign Plan, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, any fiduciary
or service provider thereof.

  

### 

  

### (g) No written communication from an officer of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has been made with respect to any Employee Plan or Foreign
Plan which, at the time made, did not accurately reflect the terms and
operations of such Employee Plan or Foreign Plan in all material respects.

  

### 

  

### (h) The Company has no Contract with any employee to maintain any Welfare
Plan or Foreign Plan for any period of time.

  

### 

  

### (i) Each Employee Plan and Foreign Plan is terminable, at the sole
discretion of the sponsor thereof, subject only to such constraints imposed
by applicable Laws.

the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any Laws of
Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets (collectively, "
_Applicable Laws_ "); and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice from
any Governmental Authority regarding any violation by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any Applicable Law.  Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has Contracted with, made sales of inventory to, or
otherwise had business dealings with, any Person (i) currently identified on
the "Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List" maintained by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury (" _OFAC_
"), or on any other similar list maintained by OFAC pursuant to any
authorizing statute, executive order or regulation, or (ii) with whom it is
prohibited to engage in transactions by any trade embargo, economic sanction,
or other prohibition of United States law, regulation, or executive order of
the President of the United States, in each case except for such Contracts,
sales and business dealings which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material impact on the Business.

Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability under, any applicable
Environmental Law, except for violations and liabilities that would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
impact on the Business. The NJDEP has never, in writing, ordered or requested
that the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, any of the Old Aircast Sellers perform (or cause the performance of)

NJDEP and their respective contractors and agents) relating to the matters

the Company or the Company Subsidiaries under applicable Environmental Laws;
(v) to the Knowledge of the Sellers, neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received any written notice that there has been any
Releases on, upon, from or into any real property immediately adjacent to any

case (with respect to this _clause (iv)_) based on or resulting from the

other Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Products or the
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except for such
failures to comply that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, have a material impact on the Business. There is no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, Enforcement Action

Company Subsidiary by the FDA or any other Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the Products under any such Law, including any comparable

withdraw its approval for, or request a recall of any Product, or commenced

of the Products under Applicable Law as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (iii) a material change in the labeling of any of the Products

Company Subsidiary has received any notice from a Governmental Authority that
the Products cannot be marketed pursuant to their respective marketing
clearances or approvals or otherwise in substantially the manner currently
marketed by the Company or Company Subsidiaries and with the same marketing
claims and materials currently used by the Company or Company Subsidiaries.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
steps to ensure that each Product may continue to be marketed under the
marketing clearance or approval relating to such Product.

controlling equity interest; or (iii) any assets or equity interests, in each
case (x) related to a business that would reasonably be expected to generate
annual revenues (or increase the Purchasers annual consolidated revenues)

excess of $10 million or (y) that would require a filing under the HSR Act or
any foreign antitrust or competition Laws or affect any then existing filing
made by the parties hereunder under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust or

### 

  

### (e) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall

## 5.5 _Access and Information_.

  



  

### (a) During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to the restrictions set forth

of the Company Subsidiaries to permit the Purchaser and its representatives
to have full access, during normal business hours and after reasonable prior
notice to the Stockholder Representative, to the properties, books and
records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, other than any personnel
information protected by applicable privacy Laws, and shall make available
such information and documents in the Companys possession relating to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may reasonably request
after a determination by Purchaser that such information or access is
reasonably necessary for Purchaser to complete this transaction;
_provided, however,_ that any such access by the Purchaser or
its representatives shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the Business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. All information
provided or obtained pursuant to the foregoing shall be held by the Purchaser
in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
 Prior to making any physical inspection of the Owned Real Property or the
Leased Real Property, the Purchaser shall provide to the
Stockholder Representative: (i) reasonable advance notice of the date and

of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries, as applicable, after reasonable
prior notice, reasonable access to the properties, books, records, employees
and auditors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to permit the Sellers to determine any matter relating to their
rights and obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or before the
Closing Date, _provided, however,_ that any such access by the Sellers and
their representatives may not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Purchaser. Following
the Closing and until the expiration of the representations and warranties
set

  



        
   

  



  

### forth in _Section 2.17_ or any claim for indemnification made with
respect to _Section 2.17_, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, prior to filing any amended income Tax Return relating
to Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, to submit such Tax Return to the Stockholder
Representative for the Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably,
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Any access pursuant to this  _Section
5.5(c)_ or _Section 1.6_ , any information retained after the Closing by any
Seller related to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Tax Return
submitted to the Sellers or the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this
_Section 5(c)_ shall be subject to the following terms:

  

### 

  

#### (i) The information learned by the Sellers and their representatives
from such access (the " _Purchaser Information_ ") shall be treated by the
Sellers and their representatives as confidential information unless and
until (i) such Purchaser Information becomes generally available to the
public through no act or failure to act by the Sellers or their
representatives; (ii) such Purchaser Information is disclosed to the Sellers
or their representatives after the date of this Agreement on a non-
confidential basis by a third party not bound by obligations of
confidentiality with respect to such Purchaser Information; or (iii)
such Purchaser Information is independently acquired or developed by the
Sellers or their representatives without reliance on, or the use of, any of
the Purchaser Information; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall
not restrict any Sellers ability to make disclosures of Purchaser
Information to its limited partners, co-investors, potential investors,
financing sources, placement agents and debtholders, each of whom shall be
subject to customary confidentiality obligations (collectively, the "
_Permitted Disclosure Recipients_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The Sellers __ recognize and acknowledge the competitive value and
confidential and proprietary nature of the Purchaser Information and that
damage could result to the Purchaser, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries if any of the Purchaser Information is disclosed to any third
party other than a Permitted Disclosure Recipient.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Except as provided above with respect to the Permitted Disclosure
Recipients, the Sellers and their representatives will use the Purchaser
Information solely for purposes related to exercising their rights and
performing their obligations under this Agreement and for matters related to
them in their capacities as the former owners and stockholders of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their representatives to,
exercise reasonable care to prevent disclosure to any third party of
Purchaser Information received by them pursuant to this _Section 5.5(c)_ ,
except as may be necessary or appropriate for the purposes described in
_Section 5.5(c)(iii)_ , and the Sellers will take precautions to protect such
Purchaser Information at least as great as they take to protect their own
confidential information.

  

#### 

  

### (d) The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
agree to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, claim
for refund or audit and the prosecution or defense of

  



        
   

  



  

### any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment that
relates to the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Business or the assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including the prosecution of any claim
against the sellers under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement or a
Subsidiary Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 5.6 _Exclusivity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers shall not,
and shall cause the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of their
respective directors, officers, agents, brokers or
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Representatives_ ") not to,
initiate or participate in any negotiation of, enter into any agreement
concerning or allow the consummation of, furnish any information to any third
Person with respect to, or respond (except by reference to prior public
announcements) to any inquiries regarding: (i) any transfer of any material
portion of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) any
issuance of capital stock of the Company or any transfer of outstanding
capital of the Company resulting in a change of control of the Company
(provided that: (A) no issuance of capital stock of the Company or transfer
of outstanding capital stock of the Company not resulting in a change of
control (including the issuance of any stock options or other rights
to acquire capital stock of the Company to any members of management of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) shall result in the
Purchaser acquiring less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Companys
outstanding shares of capital stock (and any outstanding options or other
rights to acquire capital stock of the Company) at the Closing; and (B) no
transfer of outstanding capital stock of the Company shall be made by any of
the Tailwind Stockholders); or (iii) any merger or other business combination
transaction, in each case with any party other than the Purchaser (each, an "
_Alternative Transaction_ "). If any Seller, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Seller Representatives receives an unsolicited
inquiry, offer or proposal relating to an Alternative Transaction, the
Sellers shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter notify the
Purchaser thereof, including information as to the contents and terms of such
inquiry, offer or proposal and the identity of the Person making
such inquiry, offer or proposal.

  

## 

  

## 5.7 _Notification During the Pre-Closing Period of Breaches_.  During the
Pre-Closing Period, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and each Seller, on the
other hand, will each notify the other as soon as reasonably practicable
after it becomes aware of any material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or of any
fact or condition that would cause a condition to the other partys
obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ to not be
satisfied. No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of
determining whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have
been satisfied. If a party receives a notice pursuant to this  _Section 5.7_
but nonetheless proceeds with the Closing, then from and after the Closing
such party shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights it may have
arising from or relating to a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement described in such notice (including any right to indemnification
pursuant to _Article VII_); _provided, however_ , no such waiver shall apply
if and to the extent the breach described in such notice related to the
failure of a representation or warranty of the party who delivered such
notice to be true and correct on and as of the date of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 5.8 _Publicity_. The Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall
mutually agree on a joint initial press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. After
such initial press release, each party may issue further press releases,
tombstones and similar announcements without the consent of the other
parties, provided that each such press release, tombstone or similar
announcement contains solely

  



        
   

  



  

## information that is consistent with the information contained in
such initial press release. Except as provided above in this _Section 5.8_
or solely to the extent required by applicable Law, no Seller shall make or
cause to be made (or permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
make prior to the Closing) any public announcement or issue any public notice
in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative.  Except as provided above in this _Section 5.8_ or solely to
the extent required by applicable Law, the Purchaser shall consult with
the Stockholder Representative prior to issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any of the Sellers or the Stockholder
Representative, and prior to making any filings with any Governmental
Authority (other than the filings contemplated by _Section 5.4_ ) or with any
national securities exchange with respect thereto (and prior to permitting
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to do any of the foregoing after the
Closing).

  

## 

  

## 5.9 _Employee Matters; Sale Bonus Program; Retention Program_.

  



  

### (a) Promptly after the Closing the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) to include each employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing (each an " _Employee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Employees_ ") in the employee benefit plans and programs
then in effect of the Purchaser and its Affiliates or to conform the employee
benefit plans and programs of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to be
comparable to the benefit plans and programs of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates.  From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, honor, pay, perform and satisfy any
and all obligations and responsibilities to or in respect of each Employee,
former Employee or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as of
the Closing) under the terms of each Employee Plan and each employment
agreement or other written arrangement between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any such Employee, former Employee or director, in each case,
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and disclosed in _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each employee
benefit plan maintained or contributed to by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in which an
Employee participates or will participate to recognize all service of such
Employee with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, including any
service recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
under any Employee Plan prior to the Closing, and, if applicable, to waive
any exclusions for preexisting conditions, in each such case, unless
prohibited by Applicable Law or, with respect to any welfare benefit plan,
prohibited by the terms of such plan. Nothing in this _Section 5.9(a)_ shall
modify the "at will" employee relationship between any Employee and the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) or otherwise limit the ability of the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time
subject to compliance with the applicable terms of the employee benefit plans
and programs referred to above in this _Section 5.9(a)_ that are then in
effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.9(a)_ shall be deemed in any way to restrict the Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the
Closing) from adopting, amending, rescinding, terminating or replacing any
employee benefit plan, arrangement or agreement in accordance with its terms,

  



        
   

  



  

### whether existing before or after the Closing provided that the Employees,
as a whole, are not treated in a manner that would breach the first sentence
of this _Section 5.9(a)_.

  

### 

  

### (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Sellers shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to establish
a sale bonus program **** on the terms and conditions described **** on
_Section 5.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Sale Bonus
Program_ "). During the Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers will cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to not amend, repeal or waive any term
or condition of the Sale Bonus Program without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided, however_ , (i) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
will have the discretion to make and to modify awards under the Sale Bonus
Program in their sole discretion and (ii) if the Sale Bonus Program expires
in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries may adopt a substantially similar successor plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Sellers shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to establish
an employee retention program **** on the terms and conditions described
**** on _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Retention
Program_ "). During the Pre-Closing Period, the Sellers will cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to not amend, repeal or waive any term
or condition of the Retention Program without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided, however_ , (i) no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries may modify awards
under the Retention Program (but not reduce the aggregate program) if notice
is provided to the Purchaser and the Purchaser consents in writing, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) if
the Retention Program expires in accordance with its terms prior to the
Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries may adopt a substantially
similar successor plan. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser will cause
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to amend, repeal or waive any
term or condition of the Retention Program without the prior written consent
of the Stockholder Representative and if the Stockholder
Representative provides a written notice to the Purchaser that it reasonably
believes an Employee has breached his or her Confidentiality Obligations
(as such term is defined in the Retention Program), then the Purchaser will
cause the Company to give written notice to such Employee that he or she has
breached the Confidentiality Obligations.

  

### 

  

### (d) For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will
remain responsible for all severance and other obligations under the
existing agreements with employees, and the Sellers will have no
responsibility whatsoever, financial or otherwise, for such obligations,
except for their obligations with respect to the Sale Bonus Program and the
Retention Program.

  

### 

  

## 5.10 _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, shall each be liable for one-half (1/2) of all sales, use,
transfer, stamp, duties, documentary, registration, recording and other
similar Taxes and fees (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred as a
result of the change of control of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Agreement.  The Purchaser shall file or shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to file all required Tax Returns
relating to Transfer Taxes. To the extent practicable, the amount of
such Transfer Taxes shall be calculated prior to the Closing Date, and
payment will be made by the

  



        
   

  



  

## Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable, to settle the
obligations provided in this _Section 5.10_. To the extent any such party
pays or becomes obligated to pay any such Transfer Taxes after the Closing
that was not identified and paid at the Closing in accordance with the
preceding sentence, during the six (6) month period from and after the
Closing such party may (and the Purchaser with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may), from time to time or at any time, notify the other
parties of such unpaid Transfer Taxes, which notice will be accompanied by
evidence of such partys payment or obligation to pay such Transfer Taxes and
the amount of such Transfer Taxes. (For purposes of this _Section 5.10_
, notice properly given to the Stockholder Representative will be deemed to
also be notice to each Seller.) Promptly, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, each other party shall pay to the
party that delivered such notice its proportionate share of such Transfer
Taxes. From and after the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing, no party
shall be entitled to any further payment from any other party pursuant to
this _Section 5.10_  with respect to any such Transfer Taxes.

  

## 

  

## 5.11 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

### (a) For at least six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall (and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to), to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Organizational
Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date hereof, maintain the Company and Company Subsidiaries existing
indemnification provisions with respect to each director or officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Directors or Officers_ "), including provisions relating to
advancement of expenses therein; _provided_  that if any claim or claims are
asserted or made within such six (6) year period by any Indemnified Director
or Officer, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claim or
claims. None of the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Director or Officer with
respect to a Proceeding when and if it shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable order or decree that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Director or Officer in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of existing
Organizational Documents. In the event the Company or any Company Subsidiary
fails to make any payment when due under this _Section 5.11(a)_ , the
Purchaser shall make, or cause to be made, such payment.

  

### 

  

### (b) For at least six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, maintain
in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or
before the Closing Date for the benefit of the Indemnified Directors or
Officers; _provided, however_ , that the Purchaser, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary may purchase six (6) year "tail" coverage covering acts or
omissions of the Indemnified Directors or Officers at or before the Closing
Date on substantially similar terms to the directors and officers liability
insurance policy or policies maintained by the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary or Company Subsidiaries at the date of this Agreement
(including coverage amounts and limitations). The Purchaser agrees to, and
following the Closing will cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
not take any action that would have the effect of limiting the aggregate
amount of directors and officers insurance coverage required to be
maintained for the Indemnified Director or Officer referred to in this

instruments delivered under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement or

Party concerning the breach of a representation and warranty or covenant and
agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to the end of the survival period
that would otherwise apply to such representation and warranty or covenant
and agreement, the right to indemnification with respect to the breach of the

Notice of Claim shall survive until such later date as such claim has been
fully and finally resolved in accordance with this _Article VII_.

  

#### 

  

## 7.2 _Indemnification Obligations_.

  



  

#### (a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VII_, from and
after the Closing, the Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the

include the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members,
managers, agents and representatives (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_

#### 

  

#### (b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VII_, from and
after the Closing, each Seller shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify

#### Notice of Claim is delivered to the Stockholder Representative
relating thereto on or before (x) the expiration of the Indemnity and

after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers and each of

Indemnified Party_ ") for any Losses actually incurred by such Seller
Indemnified Party as a result of the breach of: (i) any representation and
warranty of the Purchaser set forth in _Article IV_ which is surviving (as
set forth in _Section 7.1_ ) on the date on which a Notice of Claim is

#### 

  

## 7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification Amounts_.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Article VII_: (a) in no event shall the Sellers be
required to provide indemnification under this _Article VII_ unless and
until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have incurred aggregate Losses
of at least $1,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ ") resulting from
otherwise indemnifiable breaches of representations and warranties and
covenants and agreements by the Sellers, after which point the Sellers shall
only be required to provide indemnification with respect to indemnifiable
Losses in excess of the Indemnification Deductible; and (b) in no event other
than as expressly contemplated by _Section 7.12(b)_ shall any Seller be
required to provide indemnification under this _Article VII_ for aggregate
indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VII_ in excess of the amount of
such Sellers allocable portion of the then-available Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Funds (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to Losses resulting from (A) any willful breach of this
Agreement by a Seller (or Sellers), (B) any fraud of such Seller (or Sellers)
related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) any breach by such
Seller (or Sellers) of its Special Representations and Warranties, (D) any
breach by such Seller (or Sellers) of its covenants and agreements under
_Section 1.6(e)_ or _Section 1.6(f)_ or (E) any breach by the Sellers of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.3_ , the
Indemnification Deductible shall not apply and, with respect to preceding
_clauses (A)_ through _(E)_ , as to such Seller (or Sellers) the
Indemnification Cap shall not apply; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall any Seller be required to provide indemnification under this _Article
VII_ (I) for aggregate indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VII_ in
excess of such Sellers _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price and (II) with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VII_ resulting
from the matters referred to in the preceding _clause (E)_ that exceed the
then available Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds, in excess of such Sellers
_pro rata_ portion of such excess indemnifiable Losses (measured by reference
to the number of Shares owned by such Seller immediately prior to the Closing
in relation to the Shares held by all the Sellers immediately prior to the
Closing).

  

## 

  

## 7.4 _Indemnification Claim Procedure_.

  



  

### (a) Promptly after obtaining actual knowledge of any matter that a
Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable (the "
_Indemnified Party_ "), acting in good faith, reasonably believes will
entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification from any other party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Article VII_, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly

  



        
   

  



  

### provide to the Indemnifying Party notice describing the matter in
reasonable detail, including the nature of the claim, the basis for the
indemnification obligation and the Losses resulting therefrom (a " _Notice of
Claim_ "); _provided, however_ , that the failure to timely provide a Notice
of Claim hereunder shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligation
to indemnify an Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnified
Partys failure to provide or delay in providing a Notice of Claim prejudices
the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against or contest such matter.
(If the Indemnifying Party is a Seller or the Sellers, delivery by an
Indemnified Party of a Notice of Claim to the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to be effective delivery of notice to the Indemnifying
Party.)

  

### 

  

### (b) For claims for indemnification under this _Article VII_ other than
those relating to Third Party Claims and as otherwise provided in _Section
7.6_ , the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) Business Days after its
receipt of the Notice of Claim to respond to the claim(s) described therein.
Such response shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Indemnifying Partys
objection(s) to the claim(s) and its bases for such objection(s). If the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide such a response with such time period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have conceded the claim(s) set forth
in the Notice of Claim. If the Indemnifying Party provides its response
within such time period, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall negotiate the resolution of the claim(s) for a period of not less than
thirty (30) Business Days after such response is provided. If the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve any such claim(s)
within such time period, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may
thereafter pursue any legal remedies available to it with respect solely to
the unresolved claim(s), subject, to the extent applicable, to the
Indemnification Deductible, the Indemnification Cap and the other provisions
of this _Article VII_ or  _Article X_.

  

### 

  

## 7.5 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

### (a) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.4(a)_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to provide indemnification under
this _Article VII_ with respect to a claim or Proceeding by a third party (a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") to the extent that the Indemnified Partys failure
to provide or delay in providing a Notice of Claim prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys ability to contest or resolve the matters underlying
such Third Party Claim. Any Third Party Claim that is also a Multiple Source
of Recovery Matter shall be treated as a Third Party Claim, except to the
extent expressly provided in _Section 7.5(b)_.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and pursue the
defense of any Third Party Claim, at its sole cost and expense and with
counsel reasonably selected by it, upon notification thereof to the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days after the Notice of Claim has
been delivered to the Indemnifying Party or, with respect to any Multiple
Source of Recovery Matter that is a Third Party Claim, within ten (10)
Business Days after a Purchaser Indemnified Party notifies the Sellers that
the Old Aircast Sellers have declined to defend or failed to defend such
claim as a "Third Party Claim" under Article IX of the Aircast Asset Purchase
Agreement, it being agreed and understood that the Indemnifying Partys
election to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim shall not constitute
an admission that any Losses resulting therefrom are indemnifiable Losses
under this _Article VII_ or in any way prejudice or limit the Indemnifying
Partys ability to dispute any determination of whether or not any such
Losses are indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VII_. If the
Indemnified Party does not receive such notification from the
Indemnifying Party within such time period that it will assume the defense of
a

  



        
   

  



  

### Third Party Claim or, at any time after the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party is
determined by a court to have failed to adequately perform or unreasonably
delayed in performing its obligations to assume or pursue the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall fully assume, commence
and pursue its defense of such Third Party Claim on a timely and prudent
basis and thereafter promptly inform the Indemnifying Party of all material
developments related thereto.  If the Indemnifying Party disputes that it is
responsible for a Third Party Claim, it shall give notice to that effect to
the Indemnified Party, which response shall set forth, in reasonable detail,
the Indemnifying Partys objection(s) to the claim(s) and its bases for such
objection(s), and thereafter the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall negotiate the resolution of the claim(s) for a period of not less than
thirty (30) Business Days after such response is provided. If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve any
such claim(s) within such time period, either the Indemnified Party or
the Indemnifying Party may thereafter pursue any legal remedies available to
it with respect solely to the unresolved claim(s), subject, to the
extent applicable, to the Indemnification Deductible, the Indemnification Cap
and the other provisions of this _Article VII_ or _Article X_.

  

### 

  

### (c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
it shall thereafter promptly inform the Indemnified Party of all material
developments related thereto. With respect to any Third Party Claim for
which the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its own cost
and expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim through legal counsel
reasonably selected by it, but shall not assert or pursue, directly or
through its counsel, any contrary or inconsistent defenses without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Party, and _provided_ , that if in the written
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party an irreconcilable conflict of
interest arises out of the representation of the interests of the Indemnified
Party by counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall be indemnified for the reasonable fees and expenses of its
counsel (limited to one firm and, if applicable, local counsel). As long as
the Indemnifying Party is performing its obligations under this _Section 7.5_
, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, cooperate in all reasonable
ways with, make its and their relevant files and records reasonably available
for inspection and copying by, make its and their employees reasonably
available to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnifying
Party.

  

### 

  

### (d) If the Indemnifying Party (having assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim) or the Indemnified Party (having proceeded with its own defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.5_ ) proposes to
settle or compromise such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party (as applicable) shall provide notice to that effect
(together with a statement in reasonable detail of the terms and conditions
of such settlement or compromise) to the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party (as applicable), which shall be provided a reasonable time
prior to the proposed time for effecting such settlement or compromise, and
may not effect any such settlement or compromise without the prior consent of
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party (as applicable), which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If: (i)
the Indemnifying Party provides any such notice; (ii) the related
settlement or compromise offer provides for the full release of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from any and all liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim and does not purport to limit or restrict the business
or operations of the Indemnified Party in any material manner or require
future payments by the Indemnified Party arising from the conduct of the
Indemnified Partys business; and (iii) the Indemnified Party fails to
provide, in a reasonably timely manner, its

  



        
   

  



  

### consent to such settlement or compromise, then notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligation under this _Article VII_ with respect to such
Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement or compromise
offer and the Indemnified Party will be required to pay the excess of the
amount necessary to settle or compromise the Third Party Claim over the
amount of such settlement or compromise offer.

  

### 

  

### (e) With respect to any Third Party Claim which is also a Multiple Source
of Recovery Matter, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will take such actions
in their capacities as indemnified Persons with respect to indemnification
for "Third Party Claims" under Article IX of the Aircast Asset Purchase
Agreement as the Sellers may reasonably request.

  

### 

  

## 7.6 _Requirement to First Pursue Remedies from Certain Parties_.

  



  

### (a) The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are only entitled to receive indemnification from the Sellers under
this _Article VII_ for Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
resulting from any breach of the Sellers representations and warranties set
forth in _Article II_ after the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
diligently and in good faith pursued and exhausted all available remedies
under applicable Law, under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement and under
any Contract executed in connection with the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement
against the Old Aircast Sellers for all Losses incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties resulting from the matter(s) constituting such breach of
the Sellers representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_.
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the
Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that by indirectly acquiring Aircast US
Opco (one of the Company Subsidiaries), the Purchaser will obtain indirectly
the right to receive indemnification from the Old Aircast Sellers under the
Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement, and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be required to diligently and in good faith pursue and exhaust any available
remedies under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement against the Old Aircast
Sellers for any and all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
resulting from the matter(s) constituting such breach of the Sellers
representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_ before being
entitled to receive any indemnification payment from the Sellers under this
_Article VII_ with respect to such breach of the Sellers representations
and warranties set forth in _Article II_.

  

### 

  

### (b) For any matter that constitutes both: (i) a matter for which any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have available remedies under applicable
Law, under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement or under any Contract
executed in connection with the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement; and (ii) a
breach of any of the Sellers representations and warranties set forth in
_Article II_ for which any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties is, but for
the exhaustion of remedies under _Section 7.6(a)_ , entitled to be
indemnified by the Sellers under the terms and conditions of this _Article
VII_ (each, a " _Multiple Source of Recovery Matter_ "), the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties will be required to seek recovery for their Losses
related to such Multiple Source of Recovery Matter from the Old Aircast
Sellers prior to seeking recovery for such Losses from the Sellers under this
_Article VII_; _provided, however,_ that, with respect to any Losses related
to a Multiple Source of Recovery Matter which are reasonably attributable to
the operation of the Business on or after December 7, 2004 ( _i.e._ ,
the "Closing Date" under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement) (" _Post-
December 7 th Losses_"), the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek
indemnification for such Post-December 7th Losses from the Sellers under this
_Article VII_ prior to or concurrently with seeking recovery from the Old
Aircast Sellers for any such Losses related to such Multiple Source of
Recovery Matter reasonably attributable to the operation of the Business

  



         
  

  



  

### prior to December 7, 2004 (" _Pre-December 7 th Losses_"). To the extent
the Pre-December 7th Losses are not recoverable at the time the claim is made
against the Old Aircast Sellers due to the application of the threshold in
Section 9.4(a) of the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have fully exhausted its remedies and
the Sellers shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for such Pre-
December 7th Loss (or the Indemnification Deductible shall be deemed
satisfied in part by such Pre-December 7th Loss), subject to any defenses the
Sellers may have as to the appropriateness of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties claim for indemnification under this Agreement. With respect to any
Multiple Source of Recovery Matter, the Sellers may, but shall not be
obligated to, assume control over any claim or Proceeding which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties have commenced or have the right to commence for Losses
against the Old Aircast Sellers, and if the Sellers assume control over such
claim or Proceeding then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to
have satisfied their obligation to pursue recovery from the Old Aircast
Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.6(a)_ (but, except as contemplated by
_Section 7.6(d)_, such remedy shall not be deemed to have been exhausted
until the final resolution of the claim or Proceeding controlled by the
Sellers).

  

### 

  

### (c) With respect to any Multiple Source of Recovery Matter for which a
Purchaser Indemnified Party has incurred Pre-December 7th Losses, the
Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ with respect to such
Multiple Source of Recovery Matter shall identify the estimated amount
attributable to the Pre-December 7th Losses (each, an " _Initial MSRM Notice
of Claim_ ") and the Purchasers legal and expense budget for pursuing
such claim. Receipt by the Sellers of an Initial MSRM Notice of Claim shall
solely have the effect of: (i) preserving such Purchaser Indemnified Partys
right to pursue indemnification from the Sellers under this Agreement with
respect to the Pre-December 7th Losses referred to therein until such time as
such Purchaser Indemnified Party has fully exhausted its rights against the
Old Aircast Sellers with respect to the underlying Multiple Source of
Recovery Matter in accordance with this _Section 7.6_ ; and (ii) causing
there to be reserved from any available Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds
(as of the date of the Initial MSRM Notice of Claim), in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Agreement, an amount equal to the amount of Losses with respect to the
underlying Multiple Source of Recovery Matter that are claimed by such
Purchaser Indemnified Party (including the Purchasers legal and expense
budget for pursuing its remedies), in each case subject to _Section 7.6(d)_.

  

### 

  

### (d) At any time after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of an
Initial MSRM Notice of Claim and before its receipt of the corresponding
Second MSRM Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 7.6(f)_ , the Stockholder
Representative may object to the reservation of some or all of the Indemnity
and Earnout Escrow Funds in response to such Initial MSRM Notice of Claim by
providing notice thereof to the Purchaser Indemnified Party who delivered
such Initial MSRM Notice of Claim, which notice shall set forth, in
reasonable detail, the Stockholder Representatives objection(s) to the
reservation of Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds and its bases for such
objection(s) (each, a " _Reservation Objection Notice_ "). Such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have ten (10) Business Days to respond to
such Reservation Objection Notice. If such Purchaser Indemnified Party fails
to provide such a response within such ten (10) Business Day period, such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have conceded the release from
reservation of the applicable Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds as provided
in the Reservation Objection Notice, and such Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Funds shall then be released (i) from reservation under the Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Agreement, if such instructions are delivered during the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, or (ii) to the Sellers, if such
instructions are delivered after the end of

  



        
   

  



  

### the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period. If such Purchaser Indemnified
Party provides its response within such time period and disputes the matters
described in the Reservation Objection Notice, such Purchaser Indemnified
Party and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate the resolution of
such dispute for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days after
such response is provided. If such Purchaser Indemnified Party and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve any such claim(s) within
such time period, the Stockholder Representative may thereafter pursue any
legal remedies available to it (on behalf of the Sellers) against such
Purchaser Indemnified Party, subject to the other provisions of this _Article
VII_ or _Article X_, with respect to the Sellers obligations
or liabilities to such Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to the
matters underlying the Initial MSRM Notice of Claim (and if the
Stockholder Representative commences any litigation with respect to such
obligations or liabilities, such Purchaser Indemnified Party may seek
resolution in such Proceeding of the Sellers obligations and liabilities
without regard to the provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_ and receive payment of
any Losses to which it is determined to be entitled in such Proceeding). If
and to the extent that upon resolution of such dispute it is determined that
such Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
_Article VII_, then (A) such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be paid for
its indemnifiable Losses under this _Article VII_ without having exhausted
its remedies against the Old Aircast Sellers, and (B) the Sellers shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against the Old
Aircast Sellers with respect to such Losses. If and to the extent that upon
resolution of such dispute it is determined that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are not entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_, then
(I) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no further rights against
the Sellers with respect to such Multiple Source of Recovery Matter and (II)
any Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds reserved with respect to such Multiple
Source of Recovery Matter shall be released (x) from reservation under the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, if such instructions are delivered
during the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, or (y) to the Sellers, if
such instructions are delivered after the end of the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Period.

  

### 

  

### (e) With respect to any claim or Proceeding after the Closing against the
Old Aircast Sellers related to a Multiple Source of Recovery Claim (other
than with respect to a claim or Proceeding for which the Sellers have assumed
the defense pursuant to _Section 7.5_ or the right to control against the Old
Aircast Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.6(b_ )): (i) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall promptly inform the Stockholder Representative of
all material developments related thereto (including any refusal or failure
by the Old Aircast Sellers to assume, pursuant the terms of the Aircast Asset
Purchase Agreement or otherwise, the defense of any Third Party Claim which
is also a Multiple Source of Recovery Matter); (ii) the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate,
at the cost and expense of the Sellers, in the indemnification proceedings
with respect to such Pre-December 7th Losses, including through legal counsel
reasonably selected by it; and (iii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
not settle or compromise a claim against the Old Aircast Sellers or consent
to a settlement claim with a third party proposed by the Old Aircast Sellers
(as indemnifying parties under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement) or by
the Company, a Company Subsidiary or a Purchaser Indemnified Party in their
capacities as indemnified parties under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Sellers have assumed the defense of a Multiple Source of Recovery Claim
pursuant to _Section 7.5_ , are controlling a claim or Proceeding against the
Old Aircast Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.6(b_ ) or are prosecuting such a
claim or Proceeding pursuant to the subrogation rights provided by _Section
7.9_ : (i) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall take such actions as the
Sellers may reasonably request in connection therewith; (ii) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall, during

  



        
   

  



  

### normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, cooperate in all
reasonable ways with, make its and their relevant files and records
reasonably available for inspection and copying by, make its and their
employees reasonably available to, and otherwise render reasonable assistance
to, the Stockholder Representative related to the evaluation and prosecution
of the Pre-December 7th Losses; (iii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
not settle or compromise a claim against the Old Aircast Sellers or consent
to a settlement claim with a third party proposed by the Old Aircast Sellers
(as indemnifying parties under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement) or by
the Company, a Company Subsidiary or a Purchaser Indemnified Party in their
capacities as indemnified parties under the Aircast Asset Purchase Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and (iv)
the Sellers shall not settle or compromise such claim against the Old Aircast
Sellers or consent to a settlement claim with a third party proposed by the
Old Aircast Sellers (as indemnifying parties under the Aircast Asset Purchase
Agreement) without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, provided that the
consent of the Purchaser shall not be required for any settlement that does
not purport to limit or restrict the business or operations of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in any material manner or require future payments by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party arising from the conduct of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties business (except that any such settlement by the Sellers
of a Third Party Claim shall be made only in accordance with _Section
7.5(d)_).  Any reasonable third party expenses incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties in performing their obligations under the
preceding sentence shall be Losses arising out of the related Multiple Source
of Recovery Matter.

  

### 

  

### (f) If, after having fully exhausted their indemnification rights against
the Old Aircast Sellers in accordance with this _Section 7.6_ : (i) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties have not recovered from the Old Aircast Sellers
an amount equal to their aggregate indemnifiable Losses with respect to the
underlying Multiple Source of Recovery Matter, then the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may provide another Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section
7.4(a)_ concerning such Multiple Source of Recovery Matter (a " _Second MSRM
Notice of Claim_ "), which shall specify the amount of unrecovered
indemnifiable Losses and the other information required under _Section
7.4(a)_, and the procedures set forth in this _Article VII_ shall thereafter
apply with respect to such indemnification claim (with any Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Funds amount reserved in response to the corresponding Initial
MSRM Notice of Claim and not released from reservation pursuant to the
following provisions of this _Section 7.6(f)_ available for recovery by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to the Second MSRM Notice of
Claim); and (ii) if applicable, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
recovered from the Old Aircast Sellers any amount more than zero with respect
to the underlying Multiple Source of Recovery Matter, then concurrently with
delivery of the Second MSRM Notice of Claim the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall deliver written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release (A)
from reservation under the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, if such
instructions are delivered during the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, or
(B) to the Sellers, if such instructions are delivered after the end of the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, that portion of the Indemnity and
Earnout Escrow Funds reserved in response to the corresponding Initial MSRM
Notice of Claim recovered from the Old Aircast Sellers, together with any
interest and income thereon (to the extent such interest and income is not
applied to the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent as provided in the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement). If the Stockholder Representative
believes that any Purchaser Indemnified Party has failed to provide a Second
MSRM Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days after it has fully exhausted its
rights against the Old Aircast Sellers, the Stockholder Representative may at
any time thereafter, but prior to the receipt of a Second MSRM Notice of
Claim, deliver a notice to the

  



        
   

  



  

### Purchaser stating that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have failed to
deliver a Second MSRM Notice of Claim and identify the Multiple Source of
Recovery Matter to which such failure relates. If the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties fail to deliver a Second MSRM Notice of Claim within
twenty (20) Business Days after such notice from the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative may thereafter instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds reserved in
response to the corresponding Initial MSRM Notice of Claim (I) from
reservation under the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, if such
instructions are delivered during the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, or
(II) to the Sellers, if such instructions are delivered after the end of the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period.

  

### 

  

### (g) To the extent that, after having received from the Sellers under this
_Article VII_ recovery (whether from the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds
or otherwise) of any amount with respect to an Multiple Source of Recovery
Matter, any Purchaser Indemnified Party subsequently receives any recovery
from the Old Aircast Sellers with respect to such Multiple Source of Recovery
Matter (including as a result of aggregate claims against the Old Aircast
Sellers exceeding the thresholds set forth in Section 9.4(b) of the Aircast
Asset Purchase Agreement), such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly
remit to the Sellers (or to the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the
Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Agreement, if such recovery occurs prior to the
end of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period) the amount by which the
aggregate amount recovered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from the Old
Aircast Sellers and the Sellers with respect to such Multiple Source of
Recovery Matter exceeds the Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to such Multiple Source of Recovery Matter (up to the
amount previously received from the Sellers).

  

### 

  

## 7.7 _Insurance Proceeds_. The Purchaser agrees to, and to cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, following the
Closing) to: (a) in good faith, diligently seek recovery, at its or their own
expense (which shall be a Loss), of all insurance proceeds from insurers with
respect to all Losses with respect to which any Purchaser Indemnified Party
makes a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_; and (b) keep the
Stockholder Representative informed of all material matters related thereto.
To the extent that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, following the Closing) receives any
amount under insurance coverage with respect to a matter for which it has
previously obtained payment in indemnification under this _Article VII_, the
Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
insurance proceeds, pay and reimburse to the Escrow Agent (if such
reimbursement is to be delivered during the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Period) or to the Sellers (if such reimbursement is to be delivered after the
end of the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period), for any prior
indemnification payment (up to the amount of the insurance proceeds, less any
premium increases directly attributable thereto). Any amount paid to the
Sellers pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be paid to each Seller in the
proportion that the number of Shares owned by such Seller immediately prior
to the Closing bears to the aggregate number of Shares owned by all the
Sellers immediately prior to the Closing.

  

## 

  

## 7.8 _Mitigation of Damages_. Each Indemnified Party shall be required to
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, to the fullest extent
reasonably practicable, the amount of any Losses for which a claim for
indemnification is made under this _Article VII_ and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be required hereunder to provide indemnification with respect to any
Losses resulting from failure of any Indemnified Party to use such
commercially reasonable efforts.

  



        
   

  



  

## 7.9 _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment for Losses of an Indemnified
Party under this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent
of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against
any third party with respect to the Loss to which the payment relates;
_provided, however,_ with respect to the Sellers such subrogation shall not
apply to (a) rights against any Significant Customer or Significant Supplier
or (b) rights against any insurance provider except pursuant to occurrence-
based policies or tail coverage for claims-made policies issued to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. In addition
to any other obligation under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party agrees to
duly execute and deliver, upon request of the Indemnifying Party,
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect any subrogation
rights granted pursuant to this _Section 7.9_.

  

## 

  

## 7.10 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article VII_, in no event will any Indemnified Party be entitled to receive
indemnification under this _Article VII_ for Losses relating to any matter
for any consequential or punitive damages other than to the extent that an
Indemnified Party is seeking to obtain through indemnification reimbursement
of Losses resulting from a consequential or punitive damage award against it
in a Third Party Claim.

  

## 

  

## 7.11 _Tax Treatment of Seller Indemnification Payments_. Any
indemnification payments made by the Sellers pursuant to this _Article VII_
(including by release from the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds) shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as reductions to the Purchase Price paid for the
Shares.

  



  

## 7.12 _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

### (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
otherwise, but subject to _Section 7.12(b)_ , following the Closing, except
for claims arising out of the matters described in _clauses (A)_ through
_(D)_ of _Section 7.3_  (for which the Purchaser may seek any remedy
available to it in law or in equity, but subject to the limitations set forth
in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.3_ ,  _7.7_ , _7.8_ , _7.9_ and _7.10_ and _Article
X_), and subject to the Purchasers right to specifically enforce the
provisions of _Sections 1.1_ , _1.3_ and _1.6_ and each agreement and
covenant in _Article V_ or _Article X_ that by its terms is to be performed
in whole or in part after the Closing, (i) the Sellers shall have no
liability of any kind to the Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified
Party, subject only to the Purchasers right to bring indemnification claims
pursuant to this _Article VII_ solely against the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Funds in accordance with _Section 1.4_ and the Indemnity and Earnout
Escrow Agreement (but with respect to the matters described in _clause (E)_
of _Section 7.3_ , subject to the additional indemnification rights expressly
set forth in _Section 7.3_ ), which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for breach of any representations and
warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; and (ii)
the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and all other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, hereby irrevocably waives any right to any other remedy for any
breach of any representations and warranties and covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement. After the Closing, except for matters for which
specific performance is an appropriate remedy, the Sellers sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries shall be the indemnification provided by this
_Article VII_. Without limiting the generality of the preceding two
sentences of this _Section 7.12(a)_ , the rights and claims waived by the
Purchaser and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand, under this _Section 7.12(a)_ include
claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or
relating to any Environmental Law

  



        
   

  



  

### (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of
contract, breach of representations and warranties, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.12(a)_ , if
and to the extent that, during the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Period, it is
determined that the Purchaser is entitled to a payment under this _Article
VII_ and, solely as a result of payment from the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow
Funds either with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 2.3_ or pursuant to _Section 1.6_, there are not then
sufficient Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds to satisfy the full amount of
such payment, the Sellers shall each be required to pay to the Purchaser
in full satisfaction of such payment obligation, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds or interbank transfer to the Purchasers account,
their respective _pro rata_ portions of an amount equal to the lesser of:
(i) the sum of the Sellers Share and the amount of any Losses subject to
prior payments from the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds with respect to a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.3_ ; or
(ii) the amount by which the Indemnity and Earnout Escrow Funds were
insufficient to satisfy the full amount of such payment.

  

### 

  

## 7.13 _Conflict of Interest_. The Purchaser waives and will not assert,
and agrees to cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to waive and to
not assert after the Closing, any conflict of interest arising out of the
representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of
any Seller or the Stockholder Representative, or any officer, director,
principal or managing member of a general partner or managing member of a
Seller or the Stockholder Representative (any such Person, a " _Designated
Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, by Kelley Drye and Warren LLP (the " _Current
Representation_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the Closing
Purchaser discovers facts materially different from those made available to
Purchaser regarding services performed by counsel to Sellers on behalf of the
Company (and in particular, if such counsel was involved in matters that are
the basis of a Third Party Claim against the Company or a Company
Subsidiary), then Purchaser may assert a conflict of interest arising from
such newly discovered facts with respect to the matters in question.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such
litigation shall not have been dismissed, settled or otherwise cured within
fifteen (15) days after written notice has been provided by Purchaser to the
Stockholder Representative of its intent to terminate this Agreement;

this Agreement shall become untrue, in either case such that the conditions
set forth in _Sections 6.1(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ (as applicable)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue; _provided, however,_
that if such breach or untruth is curable by such Seller or the Sellers, as
applicable, prior to the End Date through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under

applicable, of such breach (and then only if such breach or untruth has not
been cured); or

representation and warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser set forth
in this Agreement or if any representation and warranty of the Purchaser set
forth in this Agreement shall become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ (as applicable) would not
be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue; _provided, however,_
that if such breach or untruth is curable by the Purchaser prior to the End
Date through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the
Stockholder Representative may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(e)_  prior to thirty (30) days following written notice having
been provided by the Stockholder Representative to the Purchaser of such
breach (and then only if such breach or untruth has not been cured).

  

### 

  

A termination made in accordance with _Section 8.1(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ or
_(e)_ shall be effective upon delivery of a notice of termination by the
terminating party to each other party (subject to the cure periods in

provision of this _Section 8.1_ pursuant to which such termination is made.

  



  

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall
become void and have no effect, without any liability to any party or any of
its directors, officers, representatives, stockholders or Affiliates in
respect hereof; _provided, however,_  that (x) any such termination shall not
affect the parties respective rights and obligations under _Section 5.8_
(regarding publicity), _Article X_, the Confidentiality Agreement and this
_Section 8.2_ and (y) if such termination results from the (i) willful
failure of a party to perform a covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement or (ii) willful breach by a party of any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for
any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of
such willful failure or willful breach. The provisions of this _Section 8.2_
 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein:

 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

## 10.1 _Expenses_.

  



  

### (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement: (i)
as between the Purchaser and the Sellers, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand, shall bear their respective expenses, costs
and fees (including attorneys, auditors and financing fees, if any)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and compliance
herewith, whether or not the Closing is consummated; and (ii) the Sellers
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to pay all of their
respective expenses, costs and fees (including attorneys and auditors fees,
if any) incurred prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree and
acknowledge that within ten (10) Business Days after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement the Purchaser shall pay to the Company the amount
set forth in _Section 10.1(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, as
reimbursement of the cost and expenses incurred by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries in connection with preparation of the Audited
Financial Statements that are not related to work that would in any event be
required in connection with the audit of Aircast Intermediate Holdco and its
Subsidiaries for the full 2005 fiscal year financial statements (the " _Stub
Period Audit Expenses_ "), and, as between the Purchaser and the Sellers, the
Stub Period Audit Expenses shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser and
shall not be the responsibility of the Sellers, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (b) If after the closing the Company or any Company Subsidiary receives
an invoice or demand for payment of fees and expenses from any advisor, legal
counsel, accountant or other professional for services performed to the
Company or a Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing, which amount would have
been paid at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)(iii)(A)_ or _(B)_ or
_(iv)(A)_  or _(B)_ had such fees and expenses been identified prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers of such unpaid fees
and expenses, which notice will be accompanied by a copy of such invoice or
demand for payment. (For purposes of this _Section 10.1(b)_ , notice
properly given to the Stockholder Representative will be deemed to also be
notice to each Seller.)  The Sellers shall thereafter assume full
responsibility for the payment of such fees and expenses, and if the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is thereafter compelled to pay any such amount,
each of the Sellers shall within five (5) Business Days after receipt from
the Purchaser of notice of such compelled payment, which notice shall be
accompanied by reasonable evidence of the amount paid and the obligation to
make such payment, pay to the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as directed by
the Purchaser, that portion of such fees and expenses paid by the Company or
such Company Subsidiary which corresponds to the portion of the Shares held
by such

  



        
   

  



  

### Seller immediately prior to the Closing in relation to the Shares held by

be taken all appropriate actions, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable, and execute, deliver and acknowledge such

this Agreement and to give effect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

_Section 4.2(b)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule); _provided, however,_
 that no such assignment by the Purchaser shall release the Purchaser from

of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties to this Agreement unless
the Purchaser and the Sellers have each duly executed and delivered to the
other party a written instrument which states that it constitutes an
amendment or modification (as applicable) to this Agreement and specifies the
provision(s) that are being amended or modified (as applicable).

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Waiver_. No purported waiver of any provision of this Agreement
shall be binding upon the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the
other hand, unless either the Purchaser (with respect to waivers by the
Purchaser) or the Stockholder Representative (with respect to waivers by the
Sellers) has duly executed and delivered to the Stockholder Representative or
the Purchaser (as applicable) a written instrument which states that it
constitutes a waiver of one or

  



        
   

  



  

## more provisions of this Agreement and specifies the provision(s) that are
being waived. Any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such written instrument. Neither the exercise
(from time to time and at any time) by a party of, nor the delay or failure
(at any time or for any period of time) to exercise, any right, power or
remedy shall constitute a waiver of the right to exercise, or impair, limit
or restrict the exercise of, such right, power or remedy or any other right,
power or remedy at any time and from time to time thereafter.  No waiver of
any right, power or remedy of a party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
other right, power or remedy of such party or shall, except to the extent so
waived, impair, limit or restrict the exercise of such right, power or
remedy.

  

## 

  

## 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all of the previous or contemporaneous
contracts, representations, warranties and understandings (whether oral or
written) by or between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including any letter of intent, exclusivity agreement, term sheet or
memorandum of terms entered into or exchanged by the parties.

  

## 

  

## 10.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall hereafter be
held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, in whole or in part, in any
jurisdiction under any circumstances for any reason: (a) such provision shall
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to cause such provision to
be valid, enforceable and legal while preserving the intent of the parties
as expressed in, and the benefits to such parties provided by, such provision
or (b) if such provision cannot be so reformed, such provision shall be
severed from this Agreement and an equitable adjustment shall be made to this
Agreement (including addition of necessary further provisions to this
Agreement) so as to give effect to the intent as so expressed and the
benefits so provided. Such holding shall not affect or impair the validity,
enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction or
under any other circumstances.  Neither such holding nor such reformation or
severance shall affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability of
any other provision of this Agreement.

  

##

time as counterparts hereto shall have been executed and delivered by all of
parties, regardless of whether all of the parties have executed the same

PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS

## 10.14 _Remedies_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article VII_, each of
the parties shall have and retain all rights and remedies, at law or in
equity, including rights to specific performance and injunctive or other
equitable relief, arising out of or relating to a breach or threatened breach
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the parties acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy
for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that irreparable
harm would result if this Agreement were not specifically enforced.
Therefore, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be enforceable by
a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and
granted in connection therewith, without the necessity of posting a bond or
other security or proving actual damages and without regard to the adequacy
of any remedy at law. A partys right to specific performance or injunctive
relief shall be in addition to all other legal or equitable
remedies available to such party.

  

### 

  

### (b) In any dispute between the Sellers and the Purchaser that results in
litigation, the prevailing party (being the Sellers and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand), shall be entitled to reimbursement
of the fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with
such litigation; and if none of the parties prevail fully on the merits in
such litigation, then each party shall bear its own fees and expenses in
connection with such litigation unless the Delaware Court designates
otherwise in a final non-appealable Order. If the Indemnified Party is the
prevailing party in any such litigation, or is otherwise awarded fees and
expenses by the Delaware Court in a final non-appealable Order, such fees and
expense to which the Indemnified Party is entitled under the preceding
sentence shall be Losses (but shall not otherwise be Losses for purposes of
_Article VII_ ). If the Indemnifying Party is the prevailing party in any
such litigation, or is otherwise awarded fees and expenses by the Delaware
Court in a final non-appealable Order, the Purchaser (if the Indemnified
Party is the Purchaser or a Purchaser Indemnified Party) or the Sellers (if
the Indemnified Party is the Seller or a Seller Indemnified Party) shall pay
such fees and expenses of the prevailing party within ten (10) Business Days
after the Order designating such party as the prevailing party or awarding
fees and expenses to such party becomes final.

  

### 

  

## 10.15 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the Purchaser and
the Sellers is, is intended to be, or shall be a beneficiary of this
Agreement, other than the Purchaser Indemnified

  



        
   

  



  

## Parties, the Seller Indemnified Parties, as provided in _Section
5.11(c)_, and any permitted successors and assigns of the parties under
_Section 10.4_.

  

## 

  

## 10.16 _Interpretation_. The language used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.
Unless otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement:
