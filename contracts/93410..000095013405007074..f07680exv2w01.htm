Stock representing such holder&#146;s proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by
the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess
of (x)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent
by Parent pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(a) over (y)&nbsp;the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(b) (such excess
being herein called the &#147;<U>Excess Shares</U>&#148;). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then
prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;<U>NYSE</U>&#148;) in the manner provided in the
following paragraph.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders that would
otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms

payable to the Exchange Agent and the expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in
connection with such sale or sales of the Excess Shares, and all related commissions, transfer
taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, will be paid by the Surviving Corporation out of
its own funds and will not be paid directly or indirectly by Parent. Until the proceeds of such
sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the

Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Subject to Sections&nbsp;5.2, 7.1(b) and 7.1(c), the Company and Parent shall each cooperate
with the other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective best
efforts to promptly (i)&nbsp;take or cause to be taken all necessary actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including, without limitation, preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii)&nbsp;obtain as soon as practicable
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to

the extent practicable each will consult the other on any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any governmental authority in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall provide the
other party with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any governmental entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; <U>provided</U> that Parent will lead all such processes; <U>provided

Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, enter into or agree to enter into any agreement for the acquisition of any
business or Person which acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially impair Parent&#146;s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

limitation defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
by any Person; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) each use its best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any governmental
authority with respect to the Merger (collectively, &#147;<U>Antitrust Laws</U>&#148;) so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than
the End Date), including, without limitation, (x)&nbsp;proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries and (y)&nbsp;otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit Parent or its Subsidiaries&#146; freedom of action with respect to,
or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary

take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or
Parent or Parent&#146;s Subsidiaries&#146; ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that any
such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company agrees and

Material Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time; <U>provided</U> that any requirement to
divest or hold separate, or limit the operation of, any division, Subsidiary, interest, business,
product line, asset or property relating to the operations conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to result in a
Substantial Detriment if such action with respect to a comparable amount of assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time.
