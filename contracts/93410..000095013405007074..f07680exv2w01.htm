 Section 1.4 _Effect on Capital Stock_.   

 (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of Articles 1 and 2, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries and except for any Dissenting Shares), together with the Company Rights attached thereto or associated therewith, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):    

 (i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1 (each, a " _Mixed Consideration_     ##### Table of Contents

  

   

 _Election Share_ ") and each No Election Share (as that term is defined in
Section 1.5(b) hereof) shall be converted into the right to receive the
combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Per
Share Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $16.25 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash
Amount_ ") and (y) 0.7725 of a share of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Mixed Election Stock
Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 1.4(c);    

 (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1 (each, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be converted (provided that the Available Cash Election Amount (as defined below) equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount (as defined below)) into the right to receive $65.00 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ "); _if_ , _however_ , (A) the product of the number of Cash Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) the difference between (x) the product of the Per Share Cash Amount and the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (y) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Election Shares (provided that No Election Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Shares for purposes of this Section 1.4(a)(ii)) and the Per Share Cash Amount (such difference being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each Cash Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction;    

 (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1 (each, a " _Stock Election Share_ ") shall be converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into the right to receive 1.03 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.4(c) (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2, the " _Stock Consideration_ ");  _provided_ _however_ , if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common stock equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1) of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration.    ##### Table of Contents

  

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock, and associated Company Rights, converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each a " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(f), and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2.   

 (c) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash Amount, the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   

 (d) At the Effective Time, (1) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and (2) each share of Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) or the Company, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. The Per Share Stock Consideration paid pursuant to this Section 1.4(d) shall not be subject to, and will not be deemed to be Stock Election Shares or otherwise taken into account in calculating, adjustments under the proviso to Section 1.4(a)(iii). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 1.4(d) shall not apply to shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside from shares held in the Companys treasury pursuant to a Company Benefit Plan (as such term is defined in Section 3.16) other than a Company Stock Option Plan or a Company Award Plan.   

 (e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  

  

  

 Section 1.5 _Election Procedures_.   

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed together with the Proxy Statement or at such other time as the Company and Parent may agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

on the record date for notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting (the "
_Election Form Record Date_ ").   

 (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, (iii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, or (iv) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock (" _No Election Shares_ "). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be No Election Shares.   

 (c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.   

 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.    ##### Table of Contents

  

 

  

  

 Section 1.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline, each such share of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Per Share Stock Consideration; provided that Parent shall be entitled to convert each such share into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or a combination of the Per Share Cash Consideration and Per Share Stock Consideration if (x) Parent shall have received an opinion from McDermott Will and Emery LLP and (y) the Company shall have received an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, in each case, to the effect that the Merger will not fail to satisfy the continuity of interest requirement under Section 368 of the Code as a result thereof. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.  

  

  

 Section 1.7 _Stock Options and Equity Awards_.   

 (a) The Board of Directors of the Company shall take such action as is necessary so that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and each phantom option to receive cash measured by an increase in value of Company Common Stock over a specified base or exercise price (a " _Company Phantom Stock Option_ ") granted under the Companys plans or agreements identified in Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules as being, to the Companys knowledge, the only employee benefit plans or agreements (including nonemployee director plans) as to which shares of Company Common Stock may be issued upon exercise of an option (collectively the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or a Company Phantom Stock Option with respect to Company Common Stock, and shall thereafter constitute an option to acquire or to be a phantom option with respect to, as the case may be, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option or Company Phantom Stock Option, as applicable, pursuant to the relevant Company Stock Option Plan under which it was issued and the agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to the Effective Time, including any provisions for acceleration (as such terms and conditions have been interpreted and applied by the Company in accordance with its past practice), the number (rounded down to the nearest whole    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

number) of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
or Company Phantom Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price or base price per
share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Company Stock Option or
Company Phantom Stock Option at and after the Effective Time shall be an
amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to (A) the
exercise price or base price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option or Company Phantom Stock Option prior to the
Effective Time divided by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. In addition,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the
terms of such Company Stock Option Plans that are necessary to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.7. For purposes of this
Section 1.7, the " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (i)
the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the fraction resulting from
dividing the Per Share Cash Amount by the closing price per share of the
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the last trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date.   

 (b) At the Effective Time each right, award or account, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, outstanding as of the Effective Time other than a Company Stock Option or a Company Phantom Stock Option (a " _Company Award_ ") granted under any employee incentive or benefit plan, program or agreement or nonemployee director plan maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the date hereof that provides for grants of equity-based awards or equity-based accounts and which are identified on Schedule 3.16 (collectively the " _Company Award Plans_ ") whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a right, award or account with respect Company Common Stock and shall thereafter constitute a right, award or account, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Award pursuant to the relevant Company Award Plan under which it was issued and the agreement, including any provisions for acceleration (as such terms and conditions have been interpreted and applied by the Company in accordance with its past practice), with respect to the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,  _provided_ that in the case of any performance shares outstanding as of the Effective Time, such performance shares shall be paid at the Effective Time at 100% of target, except that the 2005 performance share awards shall be paid at the Effective Time at between 100% and 150% of target, as determined in good faith by the Companys Management Development and Compensation Committee pursuant to the terms of the plan and the underlying award agreement. The other terms and conditions of each Company Award, and the plans or agreements under which they were issued, shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms and conditions, including any provisions for acceleration (as such terms and conditions have been interpreted and applied by the Company in accordance with its past practice). The Company represents and warrants that to the Companys knowledge there are as of the date hereof no Company Awards or Company Stock Options other than those reflected in Schedule 3.5.   

 (c) (i) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to assume as of the Effective Time the Companys obligations under the Company Stock Options and Company Awards and    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 1.7. (ii) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than five days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") a registration statement on an
appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent
Common Stock subject to options and other equity-based awards described in
this Section 1.7 and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such
options or other equity-based awards remain outstanding.  

  

  

 Section 1.8 _Shares Held by Company Affiliates_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any "affiliate" of the Company (identified pursuant to Section 7.8) until such Person shall have delivered to Parent duly executed letters as contemplated by Section 7.8. Such Persons shall be subject to the restrictions described in such letters, and such shares (or certificates therefor) shall bear a legend describing such restrictions.

ARTICLE II    

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   

  

  

 Section 2.1 _Surrender and Payment_.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Mellon Investor Services LLC or such other exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time (other than any holder which has previously and properly surrendered all of its Certificates(s) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 1.5 (each, an " _Electing Stockholder_ ")), a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon (i) with respect to any Electing Stockholder, completion of the calculations required by Section 1.4(a) or (ii) with respect to any holder that is not an Electing Stockholder, surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4 and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 and this Article 2, including cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2 and dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(f). No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or
on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration.   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Person_ " means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a government or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof.   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.1(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.1 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   

 (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.1. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and
a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously
paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.   

 (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.  

  

  

 Section 2.2 _Fractional Shares_.   

 (a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock representing such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.1(a) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (such excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in the following paragraph.   

 (b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The compensation payable to the Exchange Agent and the expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in connection with such sale or sales of the Excess Shares, and all related commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, will be paid by the Surviving Corporation out of its own funds and will not be paid directly or indirectly by Parent. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of shares of
Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which
is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.   

 (c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.1.  

  

  

 Section 2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article 2.  

  

  

 Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable governmental entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

ARTICLE III    

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as disclosed in the Company Commission Documents (as hereinafter defined) filed or furnished prior to the date hereof or in the correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent):

 (e) If the Effective Time occurs in 2005, following the payment of pro rata bonuses under the annual bonus plan for 2005 as provided under, and in accordance with the terms of such bonus plan (the " _2005 Pro Rata Bonus_ "), Parent will cause the Company to (A) maintain a bonus plan for the remainder of 2005 on the same terms and conditions and pursuant to the same targets and performance measures as were in effect for the 2005 calendar year and (B) pay bonuses within two and a half months following the end of the 2005 calendar year in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the annual bonus which would have been earned by the participants for the entire 2005 calendar year under the bonus plan described in clause (A) of this Section 6.5(e) (without reference to the 2005 Pro Rata Bonus) over (ii) the 2005 Pro Rata Bonus. If the Effective Time occurs in 2006, the Company shall be permitted prior to the Effective Time to establish a bonus plan for 2006, based upon targets and goals substantially similar to those established for 2005. In addition, in the event the Effective Time occurs in 2006, participants in the 2006 bonus plan will be paid a pro rata bonus for 2006 (the " _2006 Pro Rata Bonus_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Companys annual bonus plan, and total bonuses for 2006 will be calculated based upon the excess of actual bonus earned for 2006 over the 2006 Pro Rata Bonus in the same manner as total bonuses for 2005 would have been calculated as described above had the Effective Time occurred in 2005. Company performance in respect of calculations made under the bonus plans and the Company Plans for the calendar years 2005 and 2006 shall be calculated without taking into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, and if the Effective Time occurs prior to payment of 2005 calendar year bonuses, shall not be subject to negative discretion by the administrator for the Bonus Plan. In no event will the 2005 Pro Rata Bonus or the 2006 Pro Rata Bonus for any employee exceed 150% of the target amount for such employee for such year.

 Section 7.1 _Best Efforts._    

 (a) Subject to Sections 5.2, 7.1(b) and 7.1(c), the Company and Parent shall each cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective best efforts to promptly (i) take or cause to be taken all necessary actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including, without limitation, preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtain as soon as practicable all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any governmental authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall provide the other party with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any governmental entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that Parent will lead all such processes; _provided further_ that the foregoing shall not limit in any respect any partys obligations under this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into or agree to enter into any agreement for the acquisition of any business or Person which acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially impair Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 (b) Without limiting Section 7.1(a), Parent and the Company shall, subject to Section 7.1(c), as applicable:    

 (i) each use its best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the End Date (as defined in Section 9.1(b)(i)), including without limitation defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person; and    

 (ii) each use its best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the Merger (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date), including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary    ##### Table of Contents

  

   

restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing.
Parent and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell,
dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or Parent or Parents
Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger. The Company agrees and acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 7.1, in connection with any filing or submission
required, action to be taken or commitment to be made by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
the Companys Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent,
sell, divest, or dispose of any assets, license any Company Intellectual
Property, commit to any sale, divestiture or disposal of businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries or any license
of Company Intellectual Property or take any other action or commit to take
any action that would limit the Companys, Parents or any of
their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their
ability to retain any of, their businesses, product lines or assets or
Company Intellectual Property; provided that the foregoing shall not relieve
any party of its obligations under this Agreement.   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall not be construed to require Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries to undertake any efforts or to take any action if such efforts or action would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a Substantial Detriment. " _Substantial Detriment_ " shall mean changes or effects which would, individually or in the aggregate (and after giving effect to any reasonably expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets), result in, or be reasonably likely to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time; _provided_ that any requirement to divest or hold separate, or limit the operation of, any division, Subsidiary, interest, business, product line, asset or property relating to the operations conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to result in a Substantial Detriment if such action with respect to a comparable amount of assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, at or after the Effective Time.  

  

  

 Section 7.2 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official, or authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.  

  

  

 Section 7.3 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and Parent will, during normal business hours and upon reasonable request give the other party, its counsel, financial    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives complete access at all
reasonable times to the offices, properties, books and records of such party
and its Subsidiaries, furnish to the other party, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and
operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request
and will instruct its own employees, counsel and financial advisors to
cooperate with the other party in its investigation of the business of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be; _provided_ , that such investigation
shall not disrupt the Companys or Parents operations; _and,
provided further_ that no such investigation shall affect any representation
or warranty given by either party hereunder. All information obtained by
Parent or the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms of,
the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of February 11, 2005 between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").  

  

  

 Section 7.4 _Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their Subsidiaries to, take any action, and Parent and the Company shall not, and shall ensure that its Subsidiaries do not, fail to take any action which action or failure to act would prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  

  

  

 Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any press release or make any public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any press release or public statement as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange may be issued prior to such consultation, if the party making the release or statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party.  

  

  

 Section 7.6 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.  

  

  

 Section 7.7 _Notices of Certain Events_.   

 (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party of:    

 (i) Any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;    ##### Table of Contents

  

   

 (ii) Any notice or other written communication from any governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and    

 (iii) Any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings (A) commenced or (B) to the best of its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 _provided_ , _however,_ that no such notification (and no other notification
required to be given by the Company under any other Section of this
Agreement) shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.   

  

  

 Section 7.8 _Affiliates_.   

 (a) Not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company (i) shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who, in the Companys opinion, may be, as of the Effective Time, its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (ii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an "affiliate" of it in such letter to deliver to Parent, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, a signed agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (an " _Affiliate Agreement_ "). The Company shall notify Parent from time to time after the delivery of the letter described above of any Person not identified on such letter who then is, or may be, such an "affiliate" and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each additional Person who is identified as an "affiliate" to execute an Affiliate Agreement.   

 (b) Neither Parent or the Company shall register, or allow its transfer agent to register, on its books, any transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock of any affiliate of the Company who has not provided an executed Affiliate Agreement in accordance with this Section 7.8 unless the transfer is made in compliance with the foregoing.  

  

  

 Section 7.9 _No Solicitation_.   

 (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the Company will direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, take any action to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal (including without limitation by amending, or granting any waiver under, the Company Rights Agreement, as applicable) or any inquiry with respect thereto or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect thereto (except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 7.9), or disclose any nonpublic information or afford access to properties, books or records to, any Person that has made, or to the Companys knowledge is considering making, any Acquisition Proposal, or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, option agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal,    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any
disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; _provided,
however_ , that any such disclosure that relates to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation unless the
Companys Board of Directors reaffirms the Company Recommendation in
such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
prior to (but not after) the date of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company may, directly or indirectly through its advisors, agents or other
intermediaries (A) furnish information and access, but only in response to a
request for information or access, to any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company after the date hereof which
was not solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged by the Company or any of
its affiliates or any director, employee, representative or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) on or after the date hereof (and to such Persons advisors,
agents and intermediaries) and (B) may participate in discussions and
negotiate with such Person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal, if and only if, in any such case set forth in clause (A) or (B) of
this sentence, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good
faith, after (x) receipt of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that there is a
reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal will result in a
Superior Proposal and (y) taking into account any revisions to the terms of
the Merger or this Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified pursuant
to Section 5.2(b), that doing so is necessary for the Companys Board
of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable law, (ii) the Company complies with all of its
obligations under Section 5.2 and Section 7.9(b) below, and (iii) the Board
of Directors of the Company receives from the Person making such an
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement the material terms
of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without regard to the terms
of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects (x) no less favorable
to the Company and (y) no less restrictive to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and any information provided to such Person has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent promptly after its provision to such
Person.   

 (b) In the event the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, any indication of which the Company has knowledge that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company by any Person that has made, or to the Companys knowledge may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will (A) promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal) notify (which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material terms thereof) Parent thereof and (B) will keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed of the status and material terms of (including with respect to changes to the status or material terms of) any such Acquisition Proposal or request.

terminated and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken
place prior to the date hereof with any Persons with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (y) shall promptly request each Person, if any, that
has executed a confidentiality agreement within the nine (9) months prior to
the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries.   

 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer or proposal for, or any bona fide written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenue, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for or in respect of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all or substantially all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets (i) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, as well as any revisions to the terms of the Merger or this Agreement proposed by Parent after being notified pursuant to Section 5.2(b)) are more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) that constitutes a transaction that is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.   

 (c) The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps promptly to inform its Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 7.9.  

  

  

 Section 7.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on    ##### Table of Contents

effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Parent shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who (a) is a director or officer of the Company or (b) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (ii) either the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting but after the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company (including any of its agents or representatives) and communicated publicly or to any substantial number of stockholders of the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company by any Person or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal; or

Agreement, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder.

 Section 10.8 _Enforcement; Jurisdiction_.

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 10.1 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

FORM OF AFFILIATES RULE 145 LETTER    

* * *    

[Address to:   

ChevronTexaco Corporation 
 6001 Bollinger Canyon Road 
 San Ramon, California 94583 
 Attention: Lydia Beebe]    

 The undersigned is a holder of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of Unocal Corporation (the "Company") and will receive shares of common stock, par value $0.75 per share (the "Parent Common Stock") of ChevronTexaco Corporation ("Parent"), in connection with the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into Blue Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), although nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact.   

 If, in fact, the undersigned were an affiliate under the Act, the undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent Common Stock received in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger might be restricted unless the securities involved in such transaction were registered under the Act or an exemption from such registration were available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Act.   

 The undersigned hereby covenants with Parent that the undersigned will not offer to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Parent Common Stock received in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the Act, (ii) in compliance with Rule 145 under the Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time) or (iii) in a transaction which does not require registration under the Act. In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of _Annex I_ hereto, or an opinion, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, from independent counsel or a "no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any securities disposed of by the undersigned except in compliance with this letter, but that upon receipt of evidence of such compliance the transfer agent shall effectuate the transfer of the Parent Common Stock sold.   

 The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that, unless the transfer by the undersigned of Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned as a result of the Merger has been registered    ##### Table of Contents

  

    

under the Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145(d) under the Act, the following legend may be placed on certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned
in the Merger or held by a transferee thereof:    

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"),
APPLIES. THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF, THE ACT."   

 It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be lifted if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date on which the undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) (or any successor thereto) are then available to the undersigned, (B) two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) (or any successor thereto) are then available to the undersigned or (C) the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent a copy of a "no-action" letter or interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Act.   

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of the undersigned of "affiliate" status as described in the first paragraph of this letter agreement, or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.   

 The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock.   

 This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. This letter agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which when so executed shall constitute one agreement, notwithstanding that all of the signatories are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart.
