(iv) 1,000,000 shares of JAMDAT Common Stock, as adjusted for any Capital
Change at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
(the " _Escrow Shares_ "), certificates for which Escrow Shares shall be
delivered by JAMDAT to the Escrow Agent at Closing to be held in escrow
pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement as
security for the obligations of JAMDAT to issue Escrow Shares to the Members
pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof; and

  



  

(v) Thirteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,700,000.00) (the "
_Post Closing Consideration_ "), payable on the one year anniversary of the
Closing.  At the election of JAMDAT in its sole and absolute discretion, the
Post Closing Consideration shall be payable in any combination of
immediately available funds and/or JAMDAT Common Stock (the " _Post Closing
Shares_ ," and together with the Closing Shares and Escrow Shares, the "
_Consideration Shares_ "), with the value of any Post Closing Shares being

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

determined for this purpose as the number of such Post Closing Shares
multiplied by the average closing price of one share of JAMDAT Common Stock
for the fifteen (15) trading days immediately prior to the one year
anniversary of the Closing as reported by the NASDAQ National
Market, provided, that the aggregate Consideration Shares to be issued in
connection with the Transactions shall not exceed 19.9% of the issued and
outstanding JAMDAT Common Stock as of the date hereof. In order to elect to
pay any or all of the Post Closing Consideration with shares of JAMDAT Common
Stock, the Post Closing Shares must be registered on or before the one year
anniversary of the Closing pursuant to an effective registration statement
filed under the Securities Act.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2(a), if JAMDAT
recapitalizes, either through a subdivision (or stock split) of any of its
outstanding shares of JAMDAT Common Stock into a greater number of such
shares, or a combination (or reverse stock split) of any of its outstanding
shares of JAMDAT Common Stock into a lesser number of such shares, or
reorganizes, reclassifies or otherwise changes its outstanding shares
of JAMDAT Common Stock into the same or a different number of shares of
other classes or series of JAMDAT stock (other than through a subdivision
or combination of shares provided for in the preceding clause), or declares
a dividend or other distribution on its outstanding shares payable in shares
of JAMDAT Common Stock or in shares or securities convertible into shares
of JAMDAT Common Stock (each, a " _Capital Change_ ") at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, then the number of
Closing Shares and Escrow Shares will each be proportionally and equitably
adjusted.

  



  

(c) _Company Closing Payments_. The Members hereby direct JAMDAT as follows
(the " _Company Closing Payments_ "):

  



  

(i) At the Closing, to pay a portion of the Closing Cash in the amounts and
to the parties set forth on _Schedule 2.2(c)(i)_ ;

  



  

(ii) At the Closing, to deliver a portion of the Closing Shares in the
amounts and to the parties set forth on _Schedule 2.2(c)(ii)_ ; and

  



  

(iii) On the one-year anniversary of the Closing, to pay a portion of the
Post Closing Consideration in the amounts and to the parties set forth on
_Schedule 2.2(c)(iii)_ (with the amounts of cash and shares of JAMDAT Common
Stock paid or delivered to each such parties to be in the same proportions).

  



  

2.3 _Escrow_.

  



  

(a) _Escrow_. In order to establish a source of recovery in connection with
satisfaction of claims of the Member Indemnified Parties for any post-closing
indemnity claim pursuant to Article VIII and as evidence of the obligation of
JAMDAT through the Escrow Agent as agent of JAMDAT for such purpose to
deliver the Escrow Shares at the time or times (if any) as the Members become
entitled to receive the Escrow

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

Shares pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at Closing JAMDAT shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent to hold in escrow pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, a certificate or certificates for the Escrow Shares. As
part of the Sale Consideration, Escrow Agent, as agent for JAMDAT, shall
deliver to the Members the Escrow Shares at the time or times (if any) as the
Members become entitled to receive the Escrow Shares pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. Only such delivery by the Escrow Agent, as agent for
JAMDAT (and not delivery of the Escrow Shares to the Escrow Agent), shall
constitute payment of the portion of the Sale Consideration (if any)
consisting of the Escrow Shares.

  



  

(b) _Rights to Escrow Shares_.  During the period the Escrow Shares remain
subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, JAMDAT shall
have all right, title and interest in and to the Escrow Shares (subject only
to such rights of the Members to receive Escrow Shares pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement at such time or times as those rights arise), and
JAMDAT shall be entitled to any and all of the voting rights related to the
Escrow Shares and any and all dividends and other income payable by JAMDAT on
the Escrow Shares during such period. JAMDAT shall deliver any and all
dividends and other income payable by JAMDAT on the Escrow Shares to the
Escrow Agent to be held in escrow and considered and treated as Escrow Shares
for disposition pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation_.  At the Closing, JAMDAT shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
certificates evidencing the Escrow Shares, and the Members shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent assignments executed in blank with respect to the Escrow
Shares. In connection with any partial or complete release of Escrow Shares,
Buyer shall provide to the Members certificates evidencing such released
Escrow Shares and the parties shall execute such documents and take such
further actions as necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of
this Section.

  



  

2.4 _Intentionally Omitted_.

  



  

2.5 _Closing Adjustment for Net Cash or Net Debt_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Net Cash and Estimated Net Debt_.  Not more than five (5)
calendar days prior to the Closing and not later than two (2) calendar days
prior to the Closing, the Members shall deliver to Buyer an estimate of the
Net Cash or Net Debt (as the case may be) (the " _Estimated Net Cash_ " and
the " _Estimated Net Debt_ ", respectively). Immediately prior to the Closing,
either (i) the Company shall distribute to the Members the amount of any
Estimated Net Cash, or (ii) the Members shall contribute to the capital of
the Company cash in the amount of any Estimated Net Debt.  Within thirty
(30) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Members a statement setting forth the amount of Net Cash or the amount of
Net Debt, as the case may be, including the underlying basis of such
determination (the " _Closing Net Cash or Net Debt Statement_ "). Within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the Buyer shall have delivered the Closing
Net Cash or Net Debt Statement (the " _Member Objection Period_ "), the
Members may provide the Buyer with a certificate (the " _Member Certificate_
") stating whether the Members believe that the calculations set forth in the
Closing Net Cash or

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

Net Debt Statement are correct and complete or not correct or complete in the
Members view.  If either (i) the Member Certificate states that the Members
believe that the calculations set forth in the Closing Net Cash or Net Debt
Statement are correct or (ii) the Members fail to timely provide the Buyer
with the Member Certificate within the Member Objection Period, then the
Members shall be deemed to have conclusively agreed with and shall be bound
by the calculations set forth in the Closing Net Cash or Net Debt Statement
for purposes of this Section 2.5. If the Member Certificate is timely
delivered to Buyer and objects to the Buyers determination in the Closing
Net Cash or Net Debt Statement, then the Members and the Buyer shall confer
in good faith in an effort to reach agreement or compromise on the
determinations in the Closing Net Cash or Net Debt Statement; provided, that
if after ten (10) calendar days of negotiation and discussion the parties
have not reached an agreement regarding the Closing Adjustment (as defined
below), the parties shall appoint a mutually and reasonably satisfactory
independent certified public accountant (the " _Accountant_ ") to review the
calculations of both the Members and the Buyer of Estimated Net Cash and/or
the Estimated Net Debt, and to make a final written determination of the
Closing Adjustment, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on
the Members, Buyer, the Company and JAMDAT.  The Accountants engagement
pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall be limited solely to determining the
Net Cash or the Net Debt of the Company and the Closing Adjustment. The
Members on the one hand and JAMDAT and the Buyer on the other hand shall bear
the fees and expenses, in equal proportions, of the Accountant in connection
with its engagement hereunder.

  



  

(b) _Closing Adjustment_.  If it is finally determined in accordance with
this Section 2.5 that there is: (i) Net Cash, then within five (5) calendar
days (A) Buyer shall pay to the Members the excess, if any, of Net Cash over
Estimated Net Cash or (B) the Members shall pay to Buyer cash in an amount
equal to the sum of (w) the excess, if any, of Estimated Net Cash over Net
Cash plus (x) the amount of Net Debt, if any, and (ii) if there was Net Debt,
then within five (5) calendar days (C) Buyer shall pay to the Members the sum
equal to (y) the excess, if any, of Estimated Net Debt over Net Debt, if any,
plus (z) the amount of any Net Cash, or (D) the Members shall pay to Buyer
cash in the amount equal to any excess of Net Debt over Estimated Net Debt.
 Any payment pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence (the "
_Closing Adjustment_ ") shall be treated as an adjustment to purchase price
for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements
with respect to Taxes.

  



  

2.6 _Undistributed Pre-Closing Revenues_. Within five (5) Business Days after
the last day of each calendar month following the Closing Date, until up to
and including the last calendar month that is one hundred twenty (120) days
following the end of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs (the "
_Closing Quarter_ ") (each such monthly period, a " _Post-Closing Monthly
Period_ "), JAMDAT shall (A) deliver to the Members an estimated statement of
Monthly Net Revenues actually received by the Company during such Post-
Closing Monthly Period (the " _Monthly Net Revenue Statement_ "), and (B)
promptly pay to the Members an amount of cash equal to such Monthly
Net Revenues (such amounts, the " _Net Revenue Payments_ "). " _Monthly Net
Revenues_ " means an amount equal to the difference of (a) all cash received
by the Company after the Closing Date during the applicable Post-Closing
Monthly Period that represents the collection of Accounts Receivable earned
by the Company on or

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

before March 31, 2005 (which Accounts Receivable are not reflected on the
Closing Net Cash Statement), less (b) any royalty or other Liability of any
kind payable in respect of such Accounts Receivable (which Liability is not
reflected on the Closing Net Debt Statement), which Liabilities shall be the
responsibility of the Company and paid in accordance with their terms. Receipt
of Monthly Net Revenues and Liabilities payable in respect of such amounts
shall be determined consistent with past practices of the Company and in
accordance with GAAP and the Accounting Rules set forth on _Schedule 2.6_
(the " _Accounting Rules_ ").

  



  

ARTICLE 3

  



  

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  



  

3.1 _Income Tax Treatment_. JAMDAT, the Buyer and the Members acknowledge and
agree the Sale shall be treated for Income Tax purposes as a purchase by
JAMDAT and the Buyer of the assets of the Company that constitute a single
trade or business for purposes of IRC Section 1060 and applicable provisions
of this Article III, and (except as required by a final determination as
defined in IRC Section 1313(a) or as JAMDAT and Buyer and the Members may
agree) none of them shall take a contrary position for any Income Tax
purpose; _provided, however,_ JAMDAT and Buyer acknowledge that the Members
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Legal Requirements, treat the
Sale as a sale of the Membership Interests for Hawaii Income Tax and excise
Tax purposes and for United States federal Income Tax purposes in accordance
with IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6.

  



  

3.2 _Allocation of Tax Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that the Sale Consideration and all other amounts
treated for federal Income Tax purposes as purchase price paid by the Buyer
for the assets of the Company (the " _Tax Purchase Price_ ") shall be
allocated for such purposes as provided in Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1060-1(c) and pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_;
provided that the parties agree that the covenants contained in the Non-
Competition Agreement for Henk Rogers shall be allocated not more than
$500,000 of the Sale Consideration. The parties shall file all Tax
Returns (including but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with any such allocation so
agreed, if any. None of the parties shall take any position (whether in
audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation
that is so agreed, if any, unless required to do so by a final determination
as defined in IRC Section 1313(a). Nothing contained in this Agreement
will impose on either party the duty or obligation to contest any action that
the IRS, any Governmental Body or any other taxing authority may take or
contest any adjustment or change in such allocation that the IRS, any
Governmental Body or any other taxing authority may make or propose.

  



  

(b) No later than 75 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall give written
notice to the Members of Buyers proposed allocation of the Tax Purchase
Price in accordance with _Section 3.2(a)_. If the Members do not give written
notice to Buyer within 20 days after receipt of such notice from Buyer that
the Members disagree with any part or all of such proposal, then such
allocation as so proposed by Buyer shall be

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

deemed agreed by the parties for purposes of the application of this Section
3.2, and the Tax Purchase Price shall be allocated as provided in such notice
so given by Buyer. If the Members do so give notice of any such objection,
then from that time until the expiration of 120 days after the Closing, the
Buyer and Members shall negotiate in good faith to reach mutual agreement
regarding any matters subject to such objection and the allocation of the Tax
Purchase Price consistent with the requirements of _Section 3.2(a)_, and if
the Buyer and Member do reach such agreement within such period, then the
matters and allocation so agreed upon shall be deemed agreed by the
parties for purposes of the application of this _Section 3.2_. In the event
that the Members do so give notice of any such objection and the Buyer and
Members are unable so to reach agreement on all such matters, then the
matters and allocation that have been agreed shall be deemed agreed by the
parties for purposes of the application of this _Section 3.2_ and, to the
extent not so agreed by Buyer and Members, Buyer and each Member shall file
its Tax Returns based on its own good faith determinations. Buyer and
the Members may enter into or refuse or fail to enter into any agreement
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ in its or their good faith discretion.

  



  

(c) Each of JAMDAT and Buyer shall have no concern, responsibility or
liability for allocation of Tax Purchase Price between or among any one or
more of the Members or their designees or assignees and shall not be
obligated by this Section 3.2 to make or agree to any allocation of Tax
Purchase Price between or among the Members, their designees or assignees,
and/or any other person.

  



  

3.3 _Taxation of Escrow Shares_.  For Tax purposes, the Members intend to
report the Escrow Shares and the Post Closing Consideration on the
installment method of taxation under IRC §453 as an installment obligation.
The parties shall file all Income Tax Returns (including, but not limited
to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistently under the installment method and United States Treasury
Department Regulations Section 1.338-7 based upon the fair market value of
the Escrow Shares at the time or times of release thereof from escrow, unless
such inconsistency is mandated by applicable Legal Requirements. Further, the
parties shall report any income from the Escrow Shares during the applicable
escrow period in a manner consistent with Proposed United States Treasury
Department Regulation Section 1.468B-8, which states that Buyer shall be
treated for tax purposes as owning the Escrow Shares for the period prior to
the date on which the last of the events subject to a bona fide contingency
either has or has not occurred. The parties acknowledge and agree that
JAMDAT shall be considered the owner of the Escrow Shares for Income Tax
purposes until such time or times and to the extent the Members
become entitled to receive Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (it
being further agreed that JAMDAT may treat the Escrow Shares as not
outstanding for Income Tax purposes until such time or times).

  



  

3.4 _Taxes on Sale and Transactions; Tax Returns_. The Members, jointly and
severally, shall be responsible for, and shall pay when due, any and all
Taxes incurred by the Company, the Members, Buyer and JAMDAT, or any of them,
as a result of the Sale and the Transactions (except as otherwise provided in
the Escrow Agreement), including without limitation any income, documentary,
gross receipts, general excise, sales, use, stamp, registration or other
Taxes incurred in connection with the exchange by the Members of Membership

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

Interests for the Sale Consideration as provided hereunder, the transfer of
any assets of the Company and the covenants of the Members in the Non-
Competition Agreements.  Buyer, Company and the Members further agree, upon
request and in connection with Closing and the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns therefor pursuant to this Section 3.4, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Body or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any such documentary, gross receipts, general excise, sales,
use, stamp or registration Tax.

  



  

(a) The Members shall, at their expense, timely file all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Members (and which are not required to be executed or
filed by the Company or Buyer) with respect to all such Taxes and timely pay
all Taxes reflected as due thereon.

  



  

(b) The Members shall, at their own expense, (i) no less than fifteen (15)
calendar days before required to be filed, prepare and submit to Buyer for
review and approval by Buyer in its reasonable discretion, (A) all Tax
Returns (other than Income Tax Returns) required to be filed by the Company
with respect to such Taxes and (B) all Tax Returns relating to the Company
and the Business for a period ending on or before the Closing Date including
the final United States federal Income Tax Return for the Company, the final
State of Hawaii Income Tax Return for the Company and all applicable Hawaii
general excise and use Tax Returns and (ii) timely file all such Tax Returns
so approved by Buyer together with payment in full of all Taxes shown as due
thereon. If so approved by Buyer, then the Buyer will (i) cause the Company
to execute such Tax Returns and deliver them to the Members for filing and
(ii) if required by applicable Legal Requirements, Buyer will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns required.

  



  

(c) No less than fifteen (15) calendar days before required to be filed,
Buyer shall prepare and submit to the Members for their review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) any Tax Returns for any
period that includes and neither begins nor ends on the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), together with a statement setting forth the amount of
any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns that are allocated to the pre-
Closing portion of such Straddle Period under this Section 3.4(c). No less
than five (5) calendar days before required to be filed, the Members shall
pay to Buyer cash in the amount of such Taxes so allocated to such pre-
Closing portion of such Straddle Period. For purposes of this Agreement,
Taxes incurred during a Straddle Period shall be allocated to the pre-Closing
portion of such Straddle Period as follows: (i) _ad valorem_ Taxes for such
Straddle Period shall be equal to the amount of such _ad valorem_ Taxes for
the full Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days during the full Straddle
Period; and (ii) Taxes (other than the Taxes referred to in clause (i)) for
the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period shall be computed as if such
Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Any disagreement or dispute between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Members, on the other hand, regarding the form or content of any Tax Return
to be

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

filed pursuant to this Section 3.4 and that requires the approval of Buyer or
that will be filed by the Company and on which the Members are entitled to
approve pursuant to this Section 3.4 (i) shall be resolved in Buyers
reasonable discretion solely for purposes of facilitating the timely filing
of such Tax Return, and (ii) shall finally be resolved pursuant to a Tax
Arbitration.

  



  

3.5 _Tax-Related Books and Records_.  Buyer agrees to permit the Members and
their Representatives access to the Companys books and records (other than
any books and records created after the Closing Date) to the extent
reasonably required for purposes of (i) preparing and filing Tax Returns
required to be prepared and filed by them pursuant to Section 3.4, (ii)
enabling the Members to approve Tax Returns which the Members are entitled to
approve pursuant to Section 3.4, (iii) any Tax Arbitration, and (iv) any Tax
Contest involving the Company in which the Members are permitted or required
to participate pursuant to this Agreement.  The Members shall permit Buyer
and its Representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the
Members and their Affiliates (other than any books and records (A) created
after the Closing Date, (B) that do not relate to the Company or (C) that are
subject to the attorney-client privilege), to the extent reasonably required
for purposes of (i) preparing and filing Tax Returns required to be
prepared and filed by Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 3.4, (ii)
enabling Buyer to review and exercise its right to approve Tax Returns that
Buyer is entitled to review and approve pursuant to Section 3.4, (iii) any
Tax Arbitration, and (iv) any Tax Contest involving the Company. In addition,
if a party to this Agreement shall desire to dispose of any of such books or
records prior to the expiration of seven (7) years after the Closing Date
(or, to the extent such books and records relate thereto, prior to a final
determination of any Tax Arbitration or Tax Contest), such party shall, prior
to such disposition, give each other party to this Agreement a reasonable
opportunity, at such partys expense, to segregate and remove such books and
records as such other party may select.

  



  

3.6 _Cooperation on Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) Buyer, the Company, and the Members shall cooperate to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of books and
records and other information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Contest and explanation of any such material to the extent reasonably
required; _provided, however,_ for avoidance of any doubt, neither
this sentence nor any other provision of this Agreement shall require JAMDAT
or Buyer to disclose to the Members or any arbitrator or subject to discovery
any Tax Return or tax accrual workpapers of a Member Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) The Members shall promptly notify Buyer, in writing, upon receipt by any
Member or any of Affiliate of a Member of notice of any pending or Threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to the
income, properties or operations of the Company. The Buyer shall promptly
notify the Members, in writing, upon receipt by the Company after the Closing
Date (other than from the Members) of a notice of any pending or Threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to the
income, properties or operations of the Company for any taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

3.7 _Withholding_.  At or prior to the Closing, and at each subsequent time
as Buyer reasonably may require in connection with the payment or delivery of
any Sale Consideration or the release of any Escrow Shares, each of the
Members shall deliver to Buyer a properly completed IRS Form W-9 (or suitable
substitute form), indicating that such Member is a United States person and
establishing an exemption from backup withholding. At the time of any
direction by a Member to Buyer, pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement or
otherwise, to pay or deliver to a designee, assignee or other person any Sale
Consideration, Escrow Shares or other amount includible within the Tax
Purchase Price, such Member shall cause such designee, assignee or other
person to deliver to Buyer a duly completed and executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9
that relieves Buyer of any obligation under any Tax or other applicable Legal
Requirements to withhold and remit to any governmental authority any amount
that such Member shall so direct Buyer to pay or deliver to such designee,
assignee or other person. In all events, to the extent required by applicable
Legal Requirements, Buyer shall be entitled to withhold from any amount
payable by Buyer to any Member or any designee or assignee of any Member as
directed pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement or otherwise.

  



  

3.8 _Tax Arbitration_. Any disagreement or dispute after Closing between
Buyer and/or the Company, on the one hand, and the Members, on the other
hand, regarding (i) any matter governed by this Article III (other than a
matter governed by _Section 3.2_) or (ii) relating to the manner in which a
Tax Contest is to be handled, shall be submitted for final and binding
resolution to resolve such disagreement or dispute to (A) with respect to any
matter described in clause (i), a Tax partner at a nationally or regionally
recognized accounting firm or (B) with respect to any matter described in
clause (ii), a Tax partner at a nationally or regionally recognized law firm
with substantial experience over a period of not less than 10 years in the
handling of Tax audits, examinations, administrative appeals and related
litigation (such procedure for resolution, a " _Tax Arbitration_ ," and such
Tax partner, the " _Tax Arbitrator_ ").  The Tax Arbitrator shall be
selected by agreement of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Members, on the
other hand (and, if they fail to agree within a reasonable period, the Tax
Arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of two persons who are qualified to
serve as Tax Arbitrator, one selected by Buyer and the other selected by the
Members). Each side shall instruct the Tax Arbitrator to choose either the
position proposed by it or the position proposed by the other side and to
deliver to each side, as promptly as practicable and in any event within
ninety (90) calendar days after his or her appointment, a written report
setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement or dispute determined
in accordance with this Section 3.8. The determination of the Tax Arbitrator
shall be final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their
respective Affiliates. The fees, expenses and costs of the Tax Arbitrator
shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by the side whose position is
rejected by the Tax Arbitrator. Other than such fees and expenses of the
Tax Arbitrator, each side shall be responsible for their own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any Tax Arbitration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no arbitrator shall have any power or authority to determine or
issue any award or order mandating or compelling the manner in which a party
in fact treats any item on any Tax Return of such party or compelling or
prohibiting compliance by such party with such Tax payment, withholding or
reporting obligations that such party determines it has (or that it is
determined to have under any final determination within the meaning of IRC
Section 1313(a) or any similar determination under other applicable tax law)
or the manner in which it conducts or resolves any Tax Contest to which it is
a taxpayer party; _provided, however,_ without any implication to be drawn
from this proviso that any such breach may or will give rise to liability for
(or an excuse

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

from liability for) any damages, this sentence shall not be construed to
excuse, reduce or otherwise limit a partys liability to another party for
compensatory damages for breach of this Agreement.

provided in the Financial Statements. The Company is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No

taxation by that jurisdiction.

in filing its Tax Returns.

5.27 _Acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. Stock_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Members understands that (i) the Consideration Shares have
not been registered under the Securities Act, nor qualified under the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, (ii) the Consideration Shares
cannot be resold unless they subsequently are registered under the Securities

46   

     
   

  



  

(b) The Consideration Shares to be received by the Members pursuant to this
Agreement will be acquired for the Members own accounts and not with a view
to, or intention of, distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act,
any applicable state securities laws or foreign securities laws, and the
Consideration Shares will not be disposed of in contravention of the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws or foreign securities
laws. Each of the Members represents and warrants that he or she has no
agreement, or other arrangement, formal or informal, with any Person to sell,
transfer or pledge any part of the Consideration Shares or which would
guarantee any profit, or protect against any loss, with respect to this
investment and each of the Members has no plans to enter into any such

and other considerations relating to, an investment in the Consideration

is no assurance that the business of Buyer will be economically successful
and (ii) the Consideration Shares have not been registered under the

under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available,
will bear legends to such effect, and are subject to the Lock Up Agreement.

has requested and has not received and is not relying upon any written
offering literature or prospectus except for Buyers representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement.

its Representatives has made any representations, warranties, or guaranties
to any Member or to any Representatives concerning the condition, operations,
affairs or prospects of Buyer, except for the express representations,
warranties and covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

and documents are referred to herein as the " _JAMDAT SEC Reports_." As of
their respective dates, the JAMDAT SEC Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such JAMDAT SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were

this Agreement by a subsequently filed JAMDAT SEC Report. JAMDAT has filed
with the SEC as exhibits to the JAMDAT SEC Reports all agreements, documents
and instruments required to be so filed, and such exhibits are true and
complete copies of such agreements, documents or instruments, as the case may

any related notes thereto) contained in the JAMDAT SEC Reports (the " _JAMDAT

Agreement until the Closing, (i) complied as to form in all material respects
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
(ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes

Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented the consolidated financial position

consolidated results of JAMDATs and its Subsidiaries operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim
financial statements may not contain footnotes and were or are subject to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments in accordance with GAAP. The
audited balance sheet of JAMDAT as of December 31, 2004 (the " _JAMDAT
Balance Sheet Date_ ") contained in the JAMDAT SEC Reports is hereinafter
referred to as the " _JAMDAT Balance Sheet_." Except as disclosed in the
JAMDAT Financials, since the JAMDAT Balance Sheet Date, neither JAMDAT nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) required under GAAP to be set forth on a balance sheet that are,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the business, results of
operations or financial condition of JAMDAT and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except for: (i) Liabilities incurred since the JAMDAT Balance Sheet
Date in the Ordinary Course of Business and, individually or in the
aggregate, do not result from any breach of contract, tort or violation
of any Law, (ii) those specifically set forth or

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

adequately provided for in the JAMDAT Balance Sheet, and (iii) the fees and

in connection with this Agreement. JAMDAT has not had any dispute with any
of its auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its
past three full fiscal years or during the current fiscal year-to-date. The
books and records of JAMDAT and each of its Subsidiaries have been
maintained, and are being maintained, in all material respects in accordance
with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the JAMDAT Financials
are consistent with such books and records.

  



  

(c) JAMDAT maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

  



  

(d) JAMDAT has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act), which
(i) are designed to ensure that material information relating to JAMDAT,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to JAMDATs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities; and (ii) are effective in all material respects to perform the
functions for which they were established. JAMDAT is not aware of any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in JAMDATs internal controls.  Since the date of the
most recent evaluation of JAMDATs disclosure controls and procedures, there
have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Upon
the Closing, JAMDAT will be in compliance with all provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are effective and applicable to JAMDAT as an
"issuer" as defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Since the date of
its initial public offering, neither JAMDAT nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to JAMDATs Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of JAMDAT or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained Knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, in each case, regarding
deficient accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods or potentially fraudulent conduct of JAMDAT or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective internal controls or any material
inaccuracy in JAMDATs Financials. No attorney representing JAMDAT or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any current or former employee of JAMDAT or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by JAMDAT or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported to the JAMDAT Board or any committee thereof or to any director
or officer of JAMDAT evidence of a material violation of securities laws,
breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent conduct or similar violation by JAMDAT
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents.

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

(e) There are no material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements,
obligations (including contingent obligations), or any other relationships
with unconsolidated entities or other persons, that may have a Material
Adverse Effect on JAMDATs financial condition, changes in financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital
resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses.

  



  

6.6 _Compliance with Laws_.  Neither JAMDAT nor Buyer nor any of their
Subsidiaries is in, and none of them has received written notice of, a

(i) Except as provided in this Article VIII, the Members shall not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer with respect to a Claim
arising out of or resulting from this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of all Damages which are
otherwise recoverable by the Buyer under Section 8.2(a) exceeds Two Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) (the " _Threshold_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , Damages relating to any Surviving Tax Claim or any
matter described in clause (iv) in the first sentence of Section 8.2(a)
or in any one or more of subclauses (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) and (F) thereof
(" _Tax Damages_ ") shall not be subject to the Threshold as described in the
first independent clause of this sentence but nonetheless shall

  



  

63   

     
   

  



  

count toward the Threshold for purposes of the next sentence. If the Buyer
brings an eligible Claim or eligible Claims for an amount in excess of the
Threshold, the Members shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer for the full
amount of all Damages under Section 8.2(a) including the amount of the
Threshold.

  



  

(ii) Subject to limitations set forth in this Article VIII or elsewhere in
this Agreement upon the obligations of the parties with respect to Taxes, Tax
Damages and Tax Contests, the indemnified party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate damages in respect of any Claim for which it
is seeking indemnification under this Article VIII.

  



  

(iii) With respect to the amount of any Damages subject to indemnification
under this Section 8.2 pursuant to any Claim therefor, such Damages shall be
calculated net of any insurance proceeds or recoveries actually received as
compensation or reimbursement for such Damages by the Member Indemnified
Party, on one hand, or Buyer Indemnified Party, on the other hand, that
incurred such Damages, as applicable, from any other third party; _provided_
, _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be
deemed to require any indemnified party to use efforts to effect recovery of
available insurance claims or recoveries from any third party after denial by
the insurer or third party of a submitted claim in connection with any claim
for any Damages (so that, for example and not by way of limitation, an
indemnified party shall not be required to file or prosecute any claim in
litigation or arbitration or other proceeding to effect recovery), or to
purchase insurance with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder, and decisions regarding the purchase of such insurance shall be at
each partys sole discretion.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_.  The indemnified party shall cooperate in all reasonable
respects with the indemnifying party and its Representatives (including
without limitation its attorneys) in the investigation, trial and defense of
such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the indemnified party may, at its own cost, participate in
negotiations, arbitrations and the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in any notifications to insurers. This Section
8.2(d) shall not apply with respect to any Buyer Tax Contest or Seller Tax
Contest.

  



  

(e) _Defense of Claims_. If a claim for Damages (a " _Claim_ ") is to be
made by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder against
the indemnifying party, the party claiming such indemnification shall, give
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party as soon
as practicable after the party entitled to indemnification becomes aware of
any fact, condition or event which may give rise to Damages for
which indemnification may be sought under this Section 8.2. If any lawsuit or
enforcement action is filed against any party entitled to the benefit of
indemnity hereunder, written notice thereof shall be given to the
indemnifying party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the service of the citation or summons).
Any Claim Notice given by the party entitled to indemnification to the
indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement shall be made prior to the
Expiration Date (except with

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

respect to (i) Claims made in respect of Surviving Claims which must be made
prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for such
claims (giving effect to any waiver or extension thereof), and (ii) Surviving
Tax Claims, which must be made prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days
after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to
any waiver or extension thereof)), be in writing and shall (i) indicate that
the party entitled to indemnification has incurred, paid or accrued (in
accordance with GAAP) or, in good faith, believes it shall have to incur, pay
or accrue (in accordance with GAAP), Damages in an aggregate stated amount
arising from such Claim if it is reasonably possible to set forth an
aggregate stated amount, and (ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail
(to the extent reasonably available to the party entitled to
indemnification), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the
alleged Damages based on the Indemnified Partys good faith belief thereof,
including the identity and address of any third-party claimant and copies of
any formal demand or complaint, the amount of Damages if known, the date each
such item was incurred, paid or accrued (in accordance with GAAP) if known,
or the basis for such anticipated Damages, and the specific nature of the
breach to which such item is related and whether the party entitled to
indemnification has notified the insurance carrier if applicable.
The failure of any indemnified party to give timely notice hereunder shall
not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that
the indemnifying party has been materially damaged or prejudiced by
such failure. After such notice, the indemnifying party may elect, by
written notice to the indemnified party, at the indemnifying partys own
expense, except in the case of a Tax Contest, (i) to take control of the
defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii) to employ and
engage attorneys of its own choice, but, in any event, reasonably acceptable
to the indemnified party, to handle and defend the same unless the named
parties to such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
the indemnified party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may
be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in
which event the indemnified party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying
partys cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing and
(iii) to compromise or settle such lawsuit or action, which compromise or
settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the indemnified
party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(f) If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such lawsuit or
action within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice if
required to do so under Section 8.2(e), the indemnified party against which
such lawsuit or action has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such
effect to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake, at the
indemnifying partys cost and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement
of such lawsuit or action on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
indemnifying party; provided, however, in which event the indemnifying party
shall be entitled, at the indemnifying partys cost, risk and expense, to
participate in such defense, compromise or settlement with separate counsel
of its own choosing; provided, further, that such lawsuit or action shall not
be compromised or settled without the written consent of the indemnifying
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the indemnified
party settles or compromises such lawsuit or action without the prior written
consent of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party

  



  

65   

     
   

  



  

will bear no liability hereunder for or with respect to such lawsuit or
action unless such consent has been requested and unreasonably denied. In the
event the indemnified party assumes the defense of the lawsuit or action, the
indemnified party will keep the indemnifying party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. The indemnifying
party shall be liable for any settlement of any action effected pursuant to
and in accordance with this Section 8.2 and for any final judgment (subject
to any right of appeal) and the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless an indemnified party from and against any Damages by reason of
such settlement or judgment. This Section 8.2(f) shall not apply to any Tax
Contest.

  



  

8.3 _Limitation on Indemnity/Commitments_.

  



  

(a) The indemnification obligations of the Members (on the one hand) and
JAMDAT and Buyer (on the other hand) with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant or agreement pursuant to Sections
8.2(a) or (b), respectively, shall be limited to Claims for Damages made
prior to the Expiration Date (except with respect to (i) Claims made in
respect of Surviving Claims which must be made prior to expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for such claims (giving effect to any
waiver or extension thereof) and (ii) Surviving Tax Claims, which must be
made prior to expiration of thirty (30) days after expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver or
extension thereof)).

  



  

(b) Neither (i) the termination of the representations or warranties
contained herein, nor (ii) the expiration of the indemnification obligations
described in this Article VIII, will affect the rights of a Person in respect
of any Claim made by such Person received by the indemnifying party prior to
the Expiration Date (except with respect to (i) Claims made in respect of
Surviving Claims which must be made prior to the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations for such claims (giving effect to any waiver or
extension thereof) and (ii) Surviving Tax Claims, which must be made prior to
expiration of thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver or extension thereof)).

  



  

8.4 _Exclusive Remedies_.  From and after the Closing, except for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation of a party (" _Fraud Claims_ ") the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Buyer or JAMDAT
for any Damages directly or indirectly incurred, paid or accrued in
connection with or resulting from or arising out of this Agreement (including
any breach or alleged breach and of the representations, warranties or
covenants or agreements of the other party under this Agreement) or any
certificate, document or instrument delivered by such party at or prior to
the Closing, is set forth in this Article VIII. From and after the Closing,
except with respect to (a) Fraud Claims of a party, and (b) as provided in
the last sentence of _Section 8.4_ , the sole and exclusive remedy of JAMDAT,
the Buyer and other Member Indemnified Parties against the Members for any
Damages directly or indirectly incurred, paid or accrued in connection with
or resulting from or arising out of this Agreement (including any breach
or alleged breach and of the representations, warranties or covenants
or agreements of the other party under this Agreement) or any
certificate, document or instrument delivered by such party at or prior to
the Closing, is set forth in this Article VIII, and shall be limited to and
may only be satisfied by recourse to the Escrow Shares then held in escrow,

  



  

66   

     
   

  



  

provided that with respect to any Surviving Claims and any Surviving Tax
Claims JAMDAT and the Buyer may seek recourse directly against the Members
only (i) to the extent that any Damages incurred by JAMDAT and the Buyer, in
respect of such Surviving Claims and Surviving Tax Claims cannot be satisfied
by recourse to the Escrow Shares, and (ii) up to a maximum amount equal to
(x) the total value of the Sale Consideration, _less_ (y) the total amount of
all previously satisfied Claims. Buyer, JAMDAT and the Members agree
and acknowledge that the limitations set forth herein shall be of no force
or effect with respect to Damages of Buyer or JAMDAT related to the Non-
Competition Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Lock Up
Agreement or the License Agreement.

  



  

8.5 _Buyer Tax Contest_. A Member Indemnified Party designated by JAMDAT
shall have sole control of any audit or examination of any Tax Return filed
by it or them (or any administrative appeal or litigation relating thereto)
at any time, including any such Tax Return for any period beginning on or
after the Closing Date (a " _Buyer Tax Contest_ "), including the right to
pursue or forego any Buyer Tax Contest or continuation thereof; provided,
however, that (a) counsel for such Member Indemnified Party in any Buyer Tax
Contest involving a Claim for Tax Damages (a " _Tax Claim_ ")shall consult in
good faith with a single counsel appointed for Seller in connection with such
Buyer Tax Contest and shall keep such Seller counsel reasonably informed
regarding such Buyer Tax Contest to the extent it pertains to any Tax Claim,
and (b) such Member Indemnified Party may not resolve or settle such Buyer
Tax Contest if any Member would be required to indemnify any Member
Indemnified Party, or otherwise be required to make a payment, as a result of
such resolution or settlement of the Buyer Tax Contest unless either (i) such
Member consents to that resolution or settlement (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) or (ii) such Member Indemnified Party foregoes the
right to such indemnification by such Member and such resolution or
settlement does not impose upon a Member an obligation to make a payment for
indemnification or otherwise.

  



  

8.6 _Straddle Period Returns_. A Member Indemnified Party designated by
JAMDAT shall control any audit or examination of any Tax Return (or any
administrative appeal or litigation relating thereto) for any Straddle Period
(" _Straddle Period Tax Contest_ "), including the right to pursue or forego
any Straddle Period Tax Contest or continuation thereof; _provided, however,_
 that, to the extent such Straddle Period Tax Contest involves a Tax Claim,
(i) the counsel for such Member Indemnified Party shall consult in good faith
with a single counsel appointed for all Members in connection with such
Straddle Period Tax Contest and shall keep such counsel reasonably informed
regarding such Straddle Period Tax Contest, and (ii) such Member Indemnified
Party may not resolve or settle such Straddle Period Tax Contest if any
Member would be required to indemnify any Member Indemnified Party, or
otherwise be required to make a payment, as a result of such resolution or
settlement of the Straddle Period Tax Contest unless either (A) such Member
consents to that resolution or settlement (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) or (B) such Member Indemnified Party foregoes the
right to such indemnification by such Member and such resolution or
settlement does not impose upon a Member an obligation to make a payment for
indemnification or otherwise.

  



  

8.7 _Seller Tax Contests_.  The Members shall have sole control of any audit
or examination of any Tax Return filed by the Company for a period ending on
or before the Closing Date and any related administrative appeal or any
litigation if such audit or examination and any related administrative appeal
or litigation is not a Buyer Tax Contest or a Straddle

  



  

67   

     
   

  



  

Period Tax Contest (a " _Seller Tax Contest_ "), including the right to pursue
or forego any Seller Tax Contest or continuation thereof; _provided,
however,_  that (i) counsel for the Members in any Seller Tax Contest shall
consult in good faith with a single counsel appointed for the Member
Indemnified Parties and the Company in connection with any Seller Tax Contest
and shall keep such counsel reasonably informed regarding such Seller Tax
Contest, (ii) the Members shall not resolve or settle any Seller Tax
Contest if such resolution or settlement would or could reasonably be
anticipated to result in an increase in liability for Tax of any Member
Indemnified Party or the Company for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning on or after Closing unless JAMDAT consents to that resolution or
settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (iii) the
Members shall deliver to JAMDAT copies of all written communications to and
from any Governmental Body in respect of any such Seller Tax Contest and will
give JAMDAT the right to attend all conferences (telephonic or otherwise),
subject to JAMDATs execution of a commercially reasonable confidentiality
agreement.

(a) at any time before the Closing, by mutual written agreement of JAMDAT and
Buyer (on the one hand), and the Company and the Members (on the other hand);

  



  

(b) at any time before the Closing, by Buyer or JAMDAT upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Company or the
Members set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of
Company or the Members shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 4.2(a) or 4.2(b) would not be satisfied as of
the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue, provided that if such inaccuracy in Companys or
the Members representations and warranties or breach by Company or the
Members is curable by such party through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts, then JAMDAT or Buyer may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(b) for ten (10) calendar days after delivery of
written notice from Buyer or JAMDAT to Company and the Members of such breach
(it being understood that Buyer or JAMDAT may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if such breach by Company or the Members is
cured during such ten day period or if Buyer or JAMDAT shall have materially
breached this Agreement);

  



  

(c) at any time before the Closing, by the Company or the Members upon a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Buyer or JAMDAT set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of Buyer or JAMDAT shall have become untrue, in either case such
that the conditions set forth in Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if such inaccuracy in
Buyers or JAMDATs representations and warranties or breach by Buyer or
JAMDAT is curable by such party through the exercise of its commercially
reasonable efforts, then the Company or Members may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) for ten days after delivery of
written notice

  



  

68   

     
   

  



  

from the Company or the Members to Buyer or JAMDAT of such breach (it being
understood that the Company or the Members may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if such breach by Buyer or JAMDAT is cured
during such ten day period or if the Company or the Members shall have
materially breached this Agreement);

  



  

(d) at any time after April 30, 2005 by Buyer, the Company and the Members
upon notification of the non-terminating party by the terminating party if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before such date and such failure
to consummate is not caused by a breach of this Agreement by the terminating
party.

  



  

9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1, this Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there
will be no liability or obligation on the part of JAMDAT, Buyer, the Company
and the Members (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents or other representatives or Affiliates), except as provided in the
next succeeding sentence and except that the provisions with respect to
expenses in Section 10.6 and confidentiality in Section 10.9 will continue to
apply following any such termination. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(b), (c) or (d), JAMDAT and Buyer will remain liable to the
Company and the Members for any willful breach of this Agreement by JAMDAT or
Buyer existing at the time of such termination, and the Company and
the Members will remain liable to JAMDAT and Buyer for any willful breach of
this Agreement by the Company or the Members existing at the time of
such termination, and JAMDAT and Buyer, the Company and the Members may seek
such remedies, including damages and fees of attorneys, against the other
with respect to any such breach as are provided in this Agreement or as
are otherwise available at Law or in equity.

and governed by the laws of the State of California (without giving effect to
its choice of law principles), except with respect to matters of law
concerning the internal corporate or LLC affairs of any corporate entity
which is a party to or the subject of this Agreement, and as to those matters
the law of the jurisdiction under which the respective entity derives its
powers shall govern.

  



  

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_.  This Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, together with all exhibits and schedules hereto and
thereto (including the Disclosure Schedule and the other agreements referred
to herein), constitutes the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
parties, including but not limited to the Letter of Intent regarding Proposed
Acquisitions dated February 10, 2005 and the Letter regarding Exclusive
Dealing dated March 23, 2005. This Agreement may not be amended except in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. No
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

  



  

10.5 _Multiple Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

10.6 _Expenses_. Each party to this Agreement will bear its respective
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Transactions. In the event
of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its
own expenses will be subject to any rights of such party arising from a
breach of this Agreement by the other party. In the event the Transaction
described hereto is consummated, all expenses of the former Members related
to the Transaction described hereto shall be paid solely by those Members.

  



  

10.7 _Invalidity_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other instrument referred to herein,
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, then, to the maximum extent permitted by

  



  

71   

     
   

  



  

law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provision of this Agreement or any other such instrument.

  



  

10.8 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, none
of JAMDAT, Buyer, the Company nor the Members shall issue any press release
or make any public statement regarding this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby, without prior written approval of the other parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of announcements, statements,
acknowledgments or revelations which either party is required by applicable
Legal Requirements to make, issue or release, the making, issuing or
releasing of any such announcement, statement, acknowledgment or revelation
by the party so required to do so by law shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement if such party shall have given, to the extent reasonably
possible, not less than two (2) calendar days prior notice to the other
party, and shall have attempted, to the extent reasonably possible, to clear
such announcement, statement, acknowledgment or revelation with the other
party and limit such announcement, statement, acknowledgment or revelation to
extent commercially reasonable through confidential treatment or protective
order. Each party hereto agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold any
such consent or clearance. JAMDAT and Buyer shall have the right to issue or
make an appropriate press release or public announcement after the Closing.

  



  

10.9 _Confidential Information; No Disclosure_.

  



  

(a) Each party hereto will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its
Affiliates, and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict
confidence from any Person (other than any such Affiliate or Representative),
unless (i) compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
(including without limitation in connection with obtaining the necessary
approvals of this Agreement and the Transactions of any Governmental Body) or
by other Legal Requirements or (ii) disclosed in a Proceeding brought by a
party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies
hereunder, all documents, data and information concerning the other party or
any of its Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or such other
partys Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, except to the extent that such documents or information can be
shown to have been (a) previously known by the party receiving such documents
or information, (b) in the public domain (either prior to or after the
furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of
such receiving party or (c) later acquired by the receiving party from
another source if the receiving party is not aware that such source is under
an obligation to another party hereto to keep such documents and information
confidential; provided that following the Closing the foregoing restrictions
will not apply to Buyers use of documents and information concerning the
Business and the Company furnished by the Company hereunder or when a party
has to assert rights against another pursuant to this Agreement. In the event
the Transactions are not consummated, upon the request of the other party,
each party hereto, will, and will cause its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to, promptly redeliver or cause to be redelivered all copies
of documents and information furnished by the other party in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions and destroy or cause to be destroyed all
notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings
related thereto or based thereon prepared by the party furnished such
documents and information or its Representatives. The obligations in this 

  



  

72   

     
   

  



  

Section 10.9 shall be in addition to the obligations of the parties to that
certain Non-Disclosure Agreement between the Company and JAMDAT dated as
of February 4, 2005, which remains in full force and effect.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto recognize that the laws and public policies of the
various states of the United States may differ as to the validity and
enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section. It is
the intention of the parties that the provisions of this Section be enforced
to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought and that the unenforceability
(or the modification to conform to such laws or policies) of any provisions
of this Section shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder of
the provisions of this Section. Accordingly, if any provision of this
Section shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity
or unenforceability shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the
operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which
such determination is made and not with respect to any other provision
or jurisdiction;

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any remedy at law for any
breach of the provisions of this Section would be inadequate and the Company
hereby consents to the granting by any court of an injunction or other
