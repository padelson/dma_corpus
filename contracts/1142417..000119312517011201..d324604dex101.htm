registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent,
evidencing the same rights and entitling the Permitted Transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held by the transferor. No
transfer of a Contingent Value Right shall be valid until registered in the
CVR Register, and any transfer not duly registered in the CVR Register will be
void ab initio (unless the transfer was permissible hereunder and such failure
to be duly registered is attributable to the fault of the CVR Registrar). Any
transfer or assignment of the Contingent Value Rights shall be without charge
(other than the cost of any transfer Tax which shall be the responsibility of
the transferor) to the Holder.

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the CVR Registrar to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the CVR
Registrar shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

Company Proceeds and the Holdback Amount shall have been calculated pursuant
to Section 6.19 of the Merger Agreement, the Issuer shall calculate in good
faith and deliver to the Rights Agent a written notice (the " _Calculation
Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the Estimated Sharing Percentage and (ii) the
Issuers estimates of the Distributable Company Proceeds and the Holdback
Amount (and the calculations made by the Issuer to determine the Estimated
Sharing Percentage, the estimated Distributable Company Proceeds and the
estimated Holdback Amount) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
thirty (30) Business Days following the Auction Completion Date. If the
Estimated Sharing Percentage and estimates of the Distributable Company
Proceeds and the Holdback Amount shall have been calculated pursuant to
Section 6.19 of the Merger Agreement, then such calculations shall be
delivered to the Rights Agent as the "Calculation Notice" hereunder promptly
following the Issuance Date.

(b) In the event that prior to the Issuance Date, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have received cash proceeds from the FCC or other
applicable governmental entity in respect of any Company Spectrum (including
such cash proceeds paid to any of the Company Sharing Companies and received
by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any of
the Company Sharing Companies as option amendment fees or otherwise), the
Issuer shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the later of (x) the
Issuance Date and (y) the delivery of the Calculation Notice to the Rights
Agent pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)_ , calculate in good faith and deliver to
the Rights Agent a written notice (a " _Distribution Notice_ ") setting forth
the Payment Amount as of such time (and the calculations made by the Issuer
to determine such Payment Amount).

(c) From and after the Issuance Date, within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the end of any month during which cash proceeds are received from the FCC or
other applicable governmental entity by Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of any Company Spectrum (including such
cash proceeds paid to any of the Company Sharing Companies and received by
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any of the
Company Sharing Companies as option amendment fees or otherwise), the Issuer
shall calculate in good faith and deliver to the Rights Agent a Distribution
Notice setting forth the Payment Amount as of such time (and the calculations
made by the Issuer to determine such Payment Amount).

 

(d) Within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Calculation End Date, the
Issuer shall in good faith update all calculations previously made under this
Agreement that reflected estimates using the actual amounts for such
calculations as of the

 



12  Calculation End Date and, if applicable, taking into account any
inaccuracies identified by the Issuers certified public accounting firm in
the course of its review of the calculations made hereunder pursuant to the
Review Letter, and deliver to the Rights Agent a written notice setting forth
such updated calculations. To the extent that based on such updated
calculations:

 

(i) the sum of (x) the Distributable Company Proceeds _plus_ (y) the Holdback
Amount exceeds the aggregate amount of all of the Payment Amounts previously
distributed to the Holders hereunder, there shall be deemed to be a " _True-Up
Amount_" in the amount of such excess (and, if the True-Up Amount is less than
the Holdback Amount, a " _Retained Amount_ " in the amount of the difference
between the Holdback Amount _minus_ the True-Up Amount); or

(ii) the sum of (x) the Distributable Company Proceeds _plus_ (y) the Holdback
Amount is less than or equal to the aggregate amount of all of the Payment
Amounts previously distributed to the Holders hereunder, there shall be deemed
to be a " _Deficit Amount_ " in the amount of such deficit.

 

The written notice referred to in this Section 3.5(d) shall reflect either (A)
such True-up Amount (and, if applicable, such Retained Amount), in which
case, such notice shall be deemed to be a " _True-up Notice_", or (B) such
Deficit Amount, in which case, such notice shall be deemed to be a " _Deficit
Notice_ ". Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent, Parent shall not deliver a True-up Notice or
Deficit Notice until its certified public accounting firm has performed the
review set forth in the Review Letter of the amounts set forth in the proposed
True-up Notice or Deficit Notice (and underlying calculations) (it
being understood that to the extent such firm shall have identified any
material inaccuracies in any of such amounts or calculations, Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracies).

 

(e) In connection with the delivery of a Calculation Notice, Distribution
Notice, True-up Notice or Deficit Notice to the Rights Agent, the Issuer
shall post such notice on its website. In addition, the Rights Agent shall be
responsible for distributing each such notice to the Holders.

 

(f) Each Distribution Notice or True-up Notice will establish a payment date
(the " _CVR Payment Date_ "), which CVR Payment Date shall be (x) in the case
of a Distribution Notice, within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of
the Distribution Notice and (y) in the case of the True-up Notice, within ten
(10) Business Days after the delivery of the True-up Notice.

 

(g) No later than one (1) Business Day prior to each CVR Payment Date, the
Issuer shall cause an amount of cash equal to the Payment Amount or True-Up
Amount, as the case may be, to be deposited with the Rights Agent. On the
applicable CVR Payment Date, the Rights Agent shall pay, and the Issuer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Rights Agent to pay, the
applicable amount to each of the Holders by wire transfer or check mailed to
the address of each Holder as reflected in the

 



13  CVR Register as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to
such CVR Payment Date. The amount paid in respect of each Contingent Value
Right shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Payment
Amount or the True-Up Amount, as applicable, set forth in the applicable
Distribution Notice or True-up Notice by (y) the number of Contingent Value
Rights outstanding as reflected on the CVR Register as of the date of delivery
of the relevant Distribution Notice or True-up Notice, rounded to the nearest
whole cent (the " _CVR Payment Amount_ ").

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, (i)
in the event that the notice delivered pursuant to Section 3.5(d) is a
Deficit Notice, Parent shall be entitled to retain the Holdback Amount, and
the Holders shall not be entitled to the distribution of any further amounts
hereunder and (ii) in the event that the notice delivered pursuant to Section
3.5(d) is a True-Up Notice that contains a Retained Amount, Parent shall be
entitled to retain the Retained Amount, and the Holders shall not be entitled
to the distribution of such amount hereunder.

(i) The Issuers obligation to pay amounts to the Rights Agent hereunder,
and the Rights Agents obligation to distribute the applicable amount to the
Holders, shall be conditioned on no court or other Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any Order that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits or imposes any penalty upon the payment of Distributable Company
Proceeds and the payment being otherwise lawful.

 

(j) Any funds comprising the cash deposited with the Rights Agent under
_Section 3.5(g)_ that remain undistributed to the Holders of Contingent Value
Rights one year after the applicable CVR Payment Date shall be delivered to
the Issuer by the Rights Agent, upon demand, and any Holders of Contingent
Value Rights who have not theretofore received payment in exchange for such
Contingent Value Rights shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment
of their claim therefor. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, any portion of the consideration provided by the Issuer to the
Rights Agent that remains unclaimed one year after termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted
by law, become the property of the Issuer free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto, subject to any escheatment
laws.

 

(k) The Rights Agent shall deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or
withheld, from each CVR Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the amounts, if any, that are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code; _provided_ that in
determining the required amount to be withheld, the Rights Agent will give
effect to any properly presented form (e.g., Form W-8 or W-9 as applicable)
eliminating or reducing the amount required to be withheld. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



14 (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere
herein (including the calculation of any Distributable Company Proceeds), the
Holders shall not be entitled to any distributions hereunder unless and until
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries have received cash
proceeds from the FCC or other applicable governmental entity (including such
cash proceeds paid to any of the Company Sharing Companies and received by
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any of the
Company Sharing Companies as option amendment fees or otherwise) for the
Disposition of Company Spectrum in respect of which the FCC has accepted an
Auction Bid in the Spectrum Auction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein, in no event shall the Holders be entitled to
aggregate distributions hereunder in excess of the amount of the Distribution
Amount.

Section 3.6 No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest
in Parent.

(a) The Contingent Value Rights shall not have any voting or dividend rights,
and interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the Contingent Value
Rights to any Holder.

 

(b) The Contingent Value Rights shall not represent any equity, stock or other
ownership interest in Parent, any constituent company to the Merger, any
Affiliate of Parent or any other Person.

Section 3.7 Ability to Abandon the CVR.

 

The Holder of a Contingent Value Right may at any time, at such Holders
option, abandon all of such Holders remaining rights in a Contingent Value
Right by transferring such Contingent Value Right to the Issuer without
consideration therefor, in which case the Issuer shall continue to own such
Contingent Value Right. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit the
Issuer or any of its Affiliates from offering to acquire Contingent Value
Rights for consideration in its sole discretion and thereafter owning any
Contingent Value Rights so acquired.
