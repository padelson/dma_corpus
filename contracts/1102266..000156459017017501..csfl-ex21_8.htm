NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

Article I 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA"), at the Effective Time, HCBF shall merge with and into CenterState
pursuant to the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C and made a part hereof (the "Plan of Merger"). CenterState shall be
the Surviving Entity in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a
corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of HCBF shall cease.

 

Section 1.02Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. The bylaws of
CenterState in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of such bylaws.

 

Section 1.03Bank Merger. Except as provided below, immediately following the
Effective Time and sequentially but in effect simultaneously on the Closing
Date, Harbor Community Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of HCBF ("Harbor Community Bank"), shall be merged
(the "Bank Merger") with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking
association and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState
Bank"), in accordance with the provisions of applicable federal and state
banking laws and regulations, and CenterState Bank shall be the surviving bank
(the "Surviving Bank"). The Bank Merger shall have the effects as set forth
under applicable federal and state banking laws and regulations, and the board
of directors of the Parties shall cause the board of directors of CenterState
Bank and Harbor Community Bank, respectively, to approve a separate merger
agreement (the "Bank Plan of Merger") in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D, and cause the Bank Plan of Merger to be executed and
delivered as soon as practicable following the date of execution of this
Agreement. Each of CenterState and HCBF shall also approve the Bank Plan of
Merger in their capacities as sole shareholders of CenterState Bank and Harbor
Community Bank, respectively. As provided in the Bank Plan of Merger, the
Bank Merger may be abandoned at the election of CenterState Bank at any time,
whether before or after filings are made for regulatory approval of the Bank
Merger, but if the Bank Merger is abandoned for any reason, Harbor Community
Bank shall continue to operate under its name; provided that prior to any such
election, CenterState shall (a) reasonably consult with HCBF and its
regulatory counsel and (b) reasonably determine in good faith that that such
election will not, and would not reasonably be expected to, prevent, delay or
impair any Party's ability to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

   

Section 1.04Directors and Officers.

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, the Parties shall take all appropriate actions
so that, as of the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the
articles of incorporation of CenterState and the bylaws of CenterState, the
number of directors of the Surviving Entity shall be increased by one (1)
director and shall consist of the directors of CenterState in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time as well as one (1) current director of
HCBF selected by HCBF in its sole and absolute discretion after consultation
with CenterState (the "HCBF Designee"), until the next annual meeting of the
Surviving Entity's shareholders and until their respective successors are duly
elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Entity. Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall nominate
the HCBF Designee at the next annual meeting of the Surviving Entity's
shareholders to serve as a director of the Surviving Entity in accordance with
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity. The
officers of CenterState shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as
the officers of the Surviving Entity until their successors shall have been
duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Entity.

 

(b)Prior to the effective time of the Bank Merger, the Parties shall take all
appropriate actions so that, as of the effective time of the Bank Merger, and
subject to and in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
CenterState Bank, the number of directors of the Surviving Bank shall be
increased by one (1) director and shall consist of the directors of
CenterState Bank in office immediately prior to the effective time of the Bank
Merger as well as one (1) current director of Harbor Community Bank selected
by Harbor Community Bank in its sole and absolute discretion after
consultation with CenterState Bank (the "Harbor Community Bank Designee"),
until the next annual meeting of the Surviving Bank's sole shareholder and
until their respective successors are duly elected, appointed or qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank. Following the
effective time of the Bank Merger, CenterState, as the sole shareholder of the
Surviving Bank, shall cause the Harbor Community Bank Designee to be appointed
as a director of the Surviving Bank in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Bank for so long as the HCBF
Designee remains a director of the Surviving Entity. The officers of
CenterState Bank shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the
officers of the Surviving Bank until their successors shall have been duly
elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Bank.

 

Section 1.05Effective Time; Closing.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger and the Bank
Merger by applicable Laws. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") related to the Merger, which
will include the Plan of Merger, that shall be filed with the Department of
State of the State of Florida and the Secretary of State of the State of
Florida, as provided in the FBCA, on the Closing Date. The "Effective Time"
of the Merger shall be the

   

later of (i) the date and time of filing of the Articles of Merger, or (ii)
the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the
Articles of Merger, which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after
all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI (other than
conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived
at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof; provided, however, the Effective Time shall be no earlier than January
1, 2018.

 

(b)The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of
merger providing for the Bank Merger (the "Articles of Bank Merger") that
shall be filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida and the
Secretary of State of the State of Florida, at the later of immediately
following the Effective Time or as promptly as practicable thereafter.

 

(c)The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place beginning immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such date, the "Closing Date") at the offices of Alston and Bird LLP, One
Atlantic Center, 1201 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta, GA 30309, or such other
place as the Parties may mutually agree. At the Closing, there shall be
delivered to CenterState and HCBF the Articles of Merger, the Articles of Bank
Merger and such other certificates and other documents required to be
delivered under Article VI.

 

Section 1.06Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
Party shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (such Party, the "Requesting
Party"), the other Party and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers
and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Requesting Party and its
Subsidiaries, and each or any of them, an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Requesting Party and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, are
authorized in the name of the other Party and its Subsidiaries or otherwise to
take any and all such action.

 

Section 1.07Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. CenterState may at any
time and without the approval of HCBF change the method of effecting the
business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that
it reasonably deems such a change to be necessary; provided, however, that no
such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of the consideration to be
issued to (x) Holders as Merger Consideration or (y) holders of HCBF Stock
Options, each as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii)
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of Holders in connection
with the Merger, or (iv) require submission to or approval of HCBF's
shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement has been
approved by HCBF's shareholders. In the event that CenterState elects to make
such a change, the Parties agree to cooperate to execute appropriate documents
to reflect the change.

(ii) a cash amount equal to $1.925 plus any cash dividends payable with
respect to shares of the CenterState Common Stock that are payable to
CenterState shareholders of record as of any date on or after the Closing
Date, regardless of the issuance of certificates for shares of CenterState
Common Stock to the former holders of HCBF Common Stock, and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.04 (collectively, the "Per
Share Cash Consideration" and, together with the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of HCBF
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands the fair value of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Sections 607.1301 to 607.1333
of the FBCA (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
the holder of such Dissenting Shares (hereinafter called a "Dissenting
Shareholder") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA
(and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist),
unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect such
holder's right to receive, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights
to demand or receive, the fair value of such shares of HCBF Common Stock under
such provisions of the FBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively
withdraw or lose such Holder's dissenter's rights under the applicable
provisions of the FBCA, each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in

   

accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. HCBF shall give
CenterState (i) prompt notice of any written notices to exercise dissenters'
rights in respect of any shares of HCBF Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to the FBCA and
received by HCBF relating to dissenters' rights and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair
value under the FBCA. HCBF shall not, except with the prior written consent
of CenterState, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or
offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Article II to pay for shares of HCBF Common Stock for which dissenters' rights
have been perfected shall be returned to CenterState upon demand.

 

Section 2.02HCBF Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a)Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
HCBF Common Stock (a "HCBF Stock Option") granted under the HCBF Stock Plans
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, become fully vested and be converted into and become an option to
purchase that number of shares of CenterState Common Stock as shall equal the
product obtained by multiplying 0.75x (the "Option Exchange Ratio") by that
number of shares of HCBF Common Stock which such HCBF Stock Option entitled
the holder thereof to purchase (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and
at an exercise price equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise
price per share of the HCBF Stock Option by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that in the event that the
Merger Consideration is modified as a result of the application of Section
2.09, then the Option Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in order
to reflect the impact of such modification to the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the method of adjusting each HCBF Stock Option
that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) shall comply with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the method of adjusting all other
HCBF Stock Options shall comply with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification of
such HCBF Stock Option that would cause such HCBF Stock Option to violate Code
Section 409A. CenterState shall deliver to the holders of HCBF Stock Options,
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, any required notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to the HCBF Stock Option and stating that
such HCBF Stock Option has been issued by CenterState and shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to any adjustments required
by this Section 2.02(a)).

 

(b)HCBF shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time, all
HCBF Stock Options and any other Rights, contingent or accrued, to acquire or
receive HCBF Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares,
and each award of any kind consisting of HCBF Common Stock that may be held,
awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the HCBF Stock
Plans, or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall be, terminated and cancelled as of the
Effective Time.

   

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of HCBF (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the HCBF Stock Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions, including obtaining any
necessary consents or amendments to the applicable award agreements and equity
plans, as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.02. 

 

Section 2.03Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time,
all shares of HCBF Common Stock, when converted in accordance with Section
2.01, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive for each such share of HCBF Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock in
accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, holders of HCBF
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of
HCBF, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock as provided under this
Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of HCBF of shares of HCBF Common Stock.

 

Section 2.04Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, CenterState shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of a fractional share of CenterState Common Stock, rounded to the
nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest and
rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest in CenterState Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the CenterState Average Stock Price.

 

Section 2.05Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger and the
Bank Merger shall each qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan
of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

Section 2.06Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and provided that HCBF has delivered, or caused to be delivered,
to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent
to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail
or otherwise cause to be delivered to each Holder appropriate and customary
transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent, as well as instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
as provided for in this Agreement (the "Letter of Transmittal"). 

   

Section 2.07Deposit of Merger Consideration. 

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall (i) deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the
number of shares of CenterState Common Stock and cash sufficient to deliver
the Merger Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04, and if
applicable, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make the appropriate
payment to the holders of Dissenting Shares) (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"), and (ii) instruct the Exchange Agent to promptly pay such Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares upon receipt of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders
of HCBF for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as any interest or
proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent
to CenterState. Any shareholders of HCBF who have not theretofore complied
with this Section 2.07 and Section 2.08(a) shall thereafter look only to
CenterState for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share
of HCBF Common Stock such shareholder held as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without
any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
shares of HCBF Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not
claimed prior to the date on which such shares of CenterState Common Stock or
cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by the law
of abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of
CenterState (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to
it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be
liable to any Holder represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. CenterState and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon the stock transfer books of HCBF to establish the identity of
those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of HCBF Common Stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, CenterState and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of
competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share and file legal proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.08Delivery of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal timely
delivered to the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to receive such
Holder's pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor (with such cash rounded to the nearest whole cent) in
respect of the shares of HCBF Common Stock represented by such Holder's
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. CenterState shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the

   

Exchange Agent to provide to each such Holder their pro rata portion of the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (with such cash
rounded to the nearest whole cent) in respect of the shares of HCBF Common
Stock represented by such Holder's Certificates or Book-Entry Shares promptly
after the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent and CenterState, as the case may
be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of CenterState Common
Stock to a Holder to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled as a result
of the Merger until such Holder surrenders the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing the shares of HCBF Common Stock for exchange as provided
in this Article II, or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity
agreement and/or a bond in such amount as may be reasonably required in each
case by CenterState or the Exchange Agent.

 

(b)All shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by CenterState in respect of the
CenterState Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of CenterState Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of CenterState Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 

(c)CenterState or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as CenterState is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.09Anti-Dilution Provisions. If the number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock or HCBF Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time shall be increased or decreased, or changed into or exchanged
for a different number of kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a
result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution with
respect to such stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Merger Consideration to give holders of HCBF Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

   

Article III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HCBF

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by HCBF to
CenterState prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Agreement with
respect to each such Section below (the "HCBF Disclosure Schedule"), HCBF
hereby represents and warrants to CenterState as follows:

 

Section 3.01Organization and Standing. Each of HCBF and its Subsidiaries is
(a) an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and (b) is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified has not had, and is not reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to HCBF. A complete and accurate list of all such
jurisdictions described in (a) and (b) is set forth in HCBF Disclosure
Schedule 3.01.

 

Section 3.02Capital Stock.

 

(a)The authorized capital stock of HCBF consists of 50,000,000 shares of
common stock, of which 40,000,000 shares are designated as voting HCBF Common
Stock ("HCBF Voting Common Stock") and 10,000,000 shares are designated as
non-voting HCBF Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of blank-check preferred
stock. As of the date hereof, there are (i) 20,961,418 shares of HCBF Voting
Common Stock issued and outstanding (ii) 1,224,997 shares of non-voting HCBF
Common Stock issued and outstanding and (iii) no shares of preferred stock
issued and outstanding. As of the date hereof, there were exercisable options
to acquire 2,259,498 shares of voting HCBF Common Stock outstanding. There
are no shares of HCBF Common Stock held by any of HCBF's Subsidiaries. HCBF
Disclosure Schedule 3.02(a) sets forth, as of the date hereof, the name and
address, as reflected on the books and records of HCBF, of each Holder, and
the number of shares of HCBF Common Stock held by each such Holder. The issued
and outstanding shares of HCBF Common Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, non-assessable and have not been issued in violation of
nor are they subject to preemptive rights of any HCBF shareholder. All shares
of HCBF's capital stock issued and outstanding have been issued in compliance
with and not in violation of any applicable federal or state securities Laws.

 

(b)HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.02(b) sets forth, as of the date hereof, for
each grant or award of HCBF Stock Options or other outstanding Rights of HCBF
the (i) name of the grantee, (ii) date of the grant, (iii) expiration date,
(iv) vesting schedule, (v) exercise price, (vi) number of shares of HCBF
Common Stock, or any other security of HCBF, subject to such award, (vii)
number of shares subject to such award that are exercisable or have vested as
of the date of this Agreement, and (viii) name of the HCBF Stock Plan under
which such award was granted, if applicable. All shares of HCBF Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of HCBF Stock Options, upon their issuance on the terms
and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
and free of preemptive rights and will not be issued in violation of
preemptive rights

   

or any Law. Each HCBF Stock Option complies with or is exempt from Section
409A of the Code and qualifies for the tax treatment afforded thereto in
HCBF's Tax Returns. Each grant of HCBF Stock Options was appropriately
authorized by the board of directors of HCBF or the compensation committee
thereof, was made in accordance with the terms of the HCBF Stock Plans and any
applicable Law and regulatory rules or requirements and has a grant date
identical to (or later than) the date on which it was actually granted or
awarded by the board of directors of HCBF or the compensation committee
thereof. The per share exercise price of each HCBF Stock Option was determined
in accordance with the HCBF Stock Plans and was not less than the fair market
value of a share of HCBF Common Stock on the applicable date on which the
related grant was by its terms to be effective. There are no outstanding
shares of capital stock of any class, or any options, warrants or other
similar rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom stock"
rights, stock appreciation rights, stock based performance units, agreements,
arrangements, commitments or understandings to which HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, whether or not in writing, of any character relating
to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of HCBF or any of
HCBF's Subsidiaries or obligating HCBF or any of HCBF's Subsidiaries to issue
(whether upon conversion, exchange or otherwise) or sell any share of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in or other securities of, HCBF or any of
HCBF's Subsidiaries other than those listed in HCBF Disclosure Schedule
3.02(b). There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of HCBF or any of
HCBF's Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
HCBF Common Stock or capital stock of any of HCBF's Subsidiaries or any other
securities of HCBF or any of HCBF's Subsidiaries or to provide funds to or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise)
in any such Subsidiary or any other entity. Except for the Shareholders'
Agreement and the HCBF Voting Agreements, there are no agreements,
arrangements or other understandings with respect to the voting of HCBF's
capital stock and there are no agreements or arrangements under which HCBF is
obligated to register the sale of any of its securities under the Securities
Act. 

 

(c)All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of HCBF's
Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
and not subject to preemptive rights, and all such shares are owned by HCBF or
a Subsidiary of HCBF free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims,
pledges, taking actions, agreements, limitations in HCBF's voting rights,
charges or other Liens of any nature whatsoever, except as set forth in the
Shareholders' Agreement. Except as set forth in HCBF Disclosure Schedule
3.02(c), neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries has any trust preferred
securities or other similar securities outstanding.

 

Section 3.03Subsidiaries.

all Subsidiaries of HCBF, including the jurisdiction of organization and all

become required to be issued (other than to HCBF) by reason of any contractual
right or otherwise, (iii) there are no contracts, commitments, understandings
or arrangements by which any of such Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell

to HCBF's rights to vote or to dispose of such securities, (v) all of the

thereof, are free and clear of all Liens, other than restrictions on transfer
under applicable securities Laws.

 

(b)Neither HCBF nor any of HCBF's Subsidiaries owns any stock or equity
interest in any depository institution (as defined in 12 U.S.C. Section
1813(c)(1)) other than Harbor Community Bank. Except as set forth in HCBF
Disclosure Schedule 3.03(b), neither HCBF nor any of HCBF's Subsidiaries
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly (other than in a bona fide fiduciary

Section 3.04Corporate Power; Minute Books.

 

(a)HCBF and each of its Subsidiaries has the corporate or similar power and

each as amended to date, of HCBF and each of its Subsidiaries, the minute

in all material respects. The stock ledgers and the stock transfer books of
HCBF and each of its Subsidiaries contain complete and accurate records of the

obligation of HCBF, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity
principles).

 

Section 3.06Regulatory Approvals; No Defaults. 

 

(a)No consents or approvals of, or waivers by, or filings or registrations
with, any Governmental Authority are required to be made or obtained by HCBF
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery or

Section 3.07Financial Statements; Internal Controls.

 

(a)HCBF has previously delivered or made available to CenterState copies of
HCBF's (i) audited consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes and schedules thereto) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014, accompanied by the unqualified audit reports of Crowe Horwath LLP (for
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015) and Hacker, Johnson and Smith PA
(for the year ended December 31, 2014), in each case, independent registered
accountants (collectively, the "Audited Financial Statements") and (ii)
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes and schedules thereto) for the six months ended June 30, 2017 (the
"Unaudited Financial Statements" and collectively with the Audited Financial
Statements, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements (including
any related notes and schedules thereto) are accurate and complete in all
material respects and fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition and the results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and
cash flows of HCBF and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, subject, in the case of the
Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments (the
effect of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
HCBF) and the absence of notes and schedules (that, if presented, would not
differ materially from those included in the Audited Financial Statements).
No financial statements of any entity or enterprise other than the HCBF's

thereto and therefrom). HCBF and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. HCBF has
disclosed based on its most recent evaluations, to its outside auditors and
the audit committee of the board of directors of HCBF (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely

employees who have a significant role in HCBF's internal control over
financial reporting.

had or obtained Knowledge of, any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,

or that limits or purports to limit the ability of HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries) to own, operate, sell,
transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any assets or business; or (xi)

"HCBF Material Contract." HCBF has previously made available to CenterState
true, complete and correct copies of each such HCBF Material Contract,
including any and all amendments and modifications thereto.

 

(b)Each HCBF Material Contract is valid and binding on HCBF and any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent such Subsidiary is a party thereto, as applicable,
and, to the Knowledge of HCBF, each other party thereto, and is in full force
and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
that validity and enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the

its assets, business, or operations receives benefits, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or

authorization given directly or indirectly by HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries
is currently outstanding.

   

(c)HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.12(c) sets forth a true and complete list of all
HCBF Material Contracts pursuant to which consents, waivers or notices are or

business or that in any manner relates to their capital adequacy, credit or
risk management policies, dividend policies, management, business or
operations, nor has HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any
Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing or requesting (or is
considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any HCBF Regulatory

regulatory matters pending before any Governmental Authority with respect to
HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.14Brokers; Fairness Opinion. Neither HCBF nor any of its officers,
directors or any of its Subsidiaries has employed any broker or finder or
incurred, nor will it incur, any liability for any broker's fees, commissions
or finder's fees in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that HCBF has engaged, and will pay a fee or commission
to Sandler O'Neill and Partners ("HCBF Financial Advisor"), in accordance with
the terms of a letter agreement between HCBF Financial Advisor and HCBF, a

Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified.

 

Section 3.15Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.15(a) sets forth a true and complete list of
each HCBF Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "HCBF Benefit Plan"
means all benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
(i) covering current or former employees of HCBF, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of HCBF's related organizations described in Code Sections 414(b), (c) or
(m), or any entity which is considered one employer with HCBF, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code ("ERISA Affiliates") (such current employees
collectively, the "HCBF Employees"), (ii) covering current or former directors
of HCBF, any of its Subsidiaries, or ERISA Affiliates, or (iii) with respect
to which HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have

   

any liability or contingent liability (including liability arising from ERISA
Affiliates) including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, health/welfare, change-of-control, fringe
benefit, deferred compensation, defined benefit plan, defined contribution
plan, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based,
incentive, bonus plans, retirement plans and other policies, plans or
arrangements whether or not subject to ERISA.

 

(b)With respect to each HCBF Benefit Plan, HCBF has provided to CenterState
true and complete copies of such HCBF Benefit Plan, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any HCBF Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, summary plan descriptions and summary of material
modifications, IRS Form 5500 (for the three (3) most recently completed plan
years), the most recent IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory
letters, with respect thereto and any correspondence from any regulatory
agency. In addition, with respect to the HCBF Benefit Plans for the three (3)
most recently completed plan years, any plan financial statements and
accompanying accounting reports, service contracts, fidelity bonds and
employee and participant annual QDIA notice, safe harbor notice, or fee
disclosures notices under ERISA 404(a)(5) have been made available to
CenterState.

 

(c)All HCBF Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material respects in form
and operation with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each
HCBF Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code ("HCBF 401(a) Plan"), has received a favorable opinion, determination
or advisory letter from the IRS, and HCBF is not aware of any circumstance
that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination, opinion, or advisory letter or the loss of the
qualification of such HCBF 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and
nothing has occurred that would be expected to result in the HCBF 401(a) Plan
ceasing to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. All HCBF Benefit
Plans have been administered in all material respects in accordance with their
terms. There is no pending or, to HCBF's Knowledge, threatened litigation or
regulatory action relating to the HCBF Benefit Plans. Neither HCBF nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any HCBF Benefit
Plan, including a HCBF 401(a) Plan that could subject HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty under any Law including, but not limited to,
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. No HCBF 401(a) Plan has
been submitted under or been the subject of an IRS voluntary compliance
program submission that is still outstanding or that has not been fully
corrected in accordance with a compliance statement issued by the IRS with
respect to any applicable failures. There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to HCBF's Knowledge threatened by the IRS or the
Department of Labor with respect to any HCBF Benefit Plan. To HCBF\'s
Knowledge, there are no current, pending, or threatened investigations by the
IRS or the Department of Labor with respect to any HCBF Benefit Plan.

 

(d)No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by HCBF, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliates with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by HCBF, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliates.
Neither HCBF nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of HCBF or any ERISA
Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) a
"multiemployer

   

plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a "multiple employer
plan" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 4063 or 4064 or Code Section 413(c)
at any time. Neither HCBF, nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
have incurred, and there are no circumstances under which they could
reasonably be expected to incur, liability under Title IV of ERISA (regardless
of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA has been
required to be filed for any HCBF Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or
will be required to be filed, in either case, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e)All contributions required to be made with respect to all HCBF Benefit
Plans have been timely made. No HCBF Benefit Plan or single employer plan of
an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 3012 of ERISA
and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

 

(f)No HCBF Benefit Plan provides life insurance, medical or other employee
welfare benefits to any HCBF Employee, or any of their affiliates, upon his or
her retirement or termination of employment for any reason, except as may be
required by Law.

 

(g)All HCBF Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been operated in
all material respects in compliance with the group health plan continuation
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and all other applicable sections of
ERISA and the Code. HCBF may amend or terminate any such HCBF Benefit Plan at
any time without incurring any liability thereunder for future benefits
coverage at any time after such termination.

 

(h)Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, neither the execution
of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (individually or in
conjunction with any other event) will (i) entitle any HCBF Employee to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting (except as required
by Law) or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the HCBF Benefit
Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of
the HCBF Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment that would be an excess
"parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined
in Section 280G of the Code, or (v) limit or restrict the right of HCBF or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of the HCBF Benefit
Plans. 

 

(i)Each HCBF Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
or arrangement within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any
underlying award, is in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A
of the Code. Except as disclosed in HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.15(i), no
payment or award that has been made to any participant under a HCBF Benefit
Plan is subject to the interest and penalties specified in Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has
agreed to reimburse or indemnify any participant in a HCBF Benefit Plan for
any of the interest and the penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of
the Code that may be currently due or triggered in the future, or (ii) has
been required to report to any Government Authority any correction or taxes
due as a result of a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

   

(j)No HCBF Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of any
Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or otherwise.

 

(k)HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.15(k) contains a schedule showing the monetary
amounts payable as of the date specified in such schedule, whether
individually or in the aggregate (including good faith estimates of all
amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date of this
Agreement) under any employment, change-in-control, severance or similar
contract, plan or arrangement with or which covers any present or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries
who may be entitled to any such amount and identifying the types and estimated
amounts of the in-kind benefits due under any HCBF Benefit Plans (other than a
plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) for each such Person,
specifying the assumptions in such schedule and providing estimates of other
required contributions to any trusts for any related fees or expenses.

 

(l)HCBF and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who
directly or indirectly perform services for HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries
for purposes of each HCBF Benefit Plan, ERISA and the Code.

 

Section 3.16Labor Matters. Neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
there any proceeding pending or, to HCBF's Knowledge threatened, asserting
that HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice
(within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel
HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as to
wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor
dispute against HCBF pending or, to HCBF's Knowledge, threatened, nor to
HCBF's Knowledge is there any activity involving HCBF Employees seeking to
certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity. HCBF and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals
who directly or indirectly perform services for HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of federal and state unemployment compensation Laws,
workers' compensation Laws and the rules and regulations of the U.S.
Department of Labor. To HCBF's Knowledge, no officer of HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries is in material violation of any employment contract,
confidentiality, non-competition agreement or any other restrictive covenant.

 

Section 3.17Environmental Matters. (a) HCBF and its Subsidiaries have been
and are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including
obtaining, maintaining and complying with all permits required under
Environmental Laws for the operation of their respective businesses, (b) there
is no action or investigation by or before any Governmental Authority relating
to or arising under any Environmental Laws that is pending or, to the
Knowledge of HCBF, threatened against HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries or any
real property or facility presently owned, operated or leased by HCBF or any
of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor (including in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), (c) neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of or is subject to any liability, order, settlement, judgment,
injunction or decree involving uncompleted, outstanding or unresolved
requirements relating to or arising under Environmental Laws, (d) there have
been no releases of Hazardous Substances at, on, under, or affecting any of
the real properties or facilities presently owned, operated or leased by HCBF
or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor (including in a fiduciary or
agency

   

capacity) in amount or condition that has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in liability to HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
or arising under any Environmental Laws, and (e) there are no underground
storage tanks on, in or under any property currently owned, operated or leased
by HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries. 

 

Section 3.18Tax Matters.

 

(a)Each of HCBF and its Subsidiaries has filed all material Tax Returns that
it was required to file under applicable Laws, other than Tax Returns that are
not yet due or for which a request for extension was timely filed consistent
with requirements of applicable Law. All such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects and have been prepared in substantial
compliance with all applicable Laws. All material Taxes due and owing by HCBF
or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid. Except as set forth in HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.18(a), neither HCBF
nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return. Neither HCBF nor any of its
Subsidiaries has ever received written notice of any claim by any Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where HCBF or such Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction. There are
no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable or that
are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP) upon any of
the assets of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b)HCBF and each of its Subsidiaries have properly withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid over in connection with any amounts paid or owing to
any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other Person,
and have complied in all material respects with all applicable reporting
requirements related to Taxes.

 

(c)No foreign, federal, state, or local Tax audits or administrative or
judicial Tax proceedings are currently being conducted or pending or
threatened in writing, in each case, with respect to a material amount of
Taxes of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither HCBF nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing
authority (including jurisdictions where HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries have
not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit or
other review with respect to Taxes or (ii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of material Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by
any taxing authority against HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries which, in either
case (i) or (ii), have not been fully paid or settled.

 

(d)HCBF has delivered or made available to CenterState true and complete
copies of the material foreign, federal, state or local Tax Returns filed with
respect to HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries, and of all material examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by HCBF,
in each case with respect to income Taxes, for taxable periods ended on or
after December 31, 2014.

 

(e)With respect to tax years open for audit as of the date hereof, neither
HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency.

   

(f)Neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2)
during the applicable period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).
Neither HCBF nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is otherwise bound
by any material Tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than such an
agreement (i) exclusively between or among HCBF and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
with customers, vendors, lessors or similar third parties entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business and not primarily related to Taxes or (iii) that
will terminate as of the Closing Date without any further material payments
being required to be made). HCBF (i) has not been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the
common parent of which was HCBF), and (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of

Authority of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be

Section 4.10Compliance with Laws. 

 

(a)CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries is, and have been since January 1,
2014, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal,

certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect
and, to CenterState's Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them
is threatened.

 

(c)Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries has received, since January

the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and all

paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or, to CenterState's Knowledge, threatened. CenterState Bank received
a rating of "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the Community
Reinvestment Act.

 

(c)Since January 1, 2014, neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is
party to, or the subject of, any cease-and-desist order, consent order,
written agreement, order for civil money penalty, refund, restitution, prompt
corrective action directive, memorandum of understanding, supervisory letter,
individual minimum capital requirement, operating agreement, or any other
formal or informal enforcement action issued or required by, or entered into
with, any Governmental Authority. Neither CenterState nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made, adopted, or implemented any commitment, board
resolution, policy, or procedure at the request or recommendation of any
Governmental Authority that limits in any material respect the conduct of its
business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its
payment of dividends or distribution of capital, its credit or risk
management, its compliance program, its management, its growth, or its
business. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge that
any Governmental Authority is considering issuing, initiating, ordering,
requesting, recommending, or otherwise proceeding with any of the items
referenced in this paragraph.

   

(d)Except for examinations of CenterState and its Subsidiaries conducted by
their respective primary functional regulators in the Ordinary Course of
Business, no Governmental Authority has initiated, threatened, or has pending
any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of CenterState, any inquiry or
investigation into the business or operations of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where such proceeding, inquiry, or investigation would
not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to CenterState or to prevent or
materially delay receipt of the Regulatory Approvals.

 

(e)There is no unresolved violation, apparent violation, criticism, matter
requiring attention, recommendation, or exception cited, made, or threatened
by any Governmental Authority in any report of examination, report of
inspection, supervisory letter or other communication with CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries that (i) would reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
CenterState or (ii) would reasonably be likely to prevent or materially delay
the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals.

 

Section 4.12Brokers. Neither CenterState nor any of its officers, directors
or any of its Subsidiaries has employed any broker or finder or incurred, nor
will it incur, any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's

commission to Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.

 

Section 4.13Tax Matters.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries has filed all material Tax Returns

correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable Laws. All material Taxes due and
owing by CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any

Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where CenterState or such Subsidiary
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to Taxes by that
jurisdiction. There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet
due and payable or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP) upon any of the assets of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b)No foreign, federal, state, or local Tax audits or administrative or
judicial Tax proceedings are currently being conducted or pending or
threatened in writing, in each case, with respect to a material amount of
Taxes of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither CenterState nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local
taxing authority (including jurisdictions where CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent
to open an audit or other review with respect to Taxes or (ii) notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of material Tax proposed,
asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries which, in either case (i) or (ii), have not been fully paid
or settled.

   

(c)Since December 31, 2016, neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or
losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business.

"listed transaction," as defined in Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code and

statute of limitations has not expired.

 

(e)Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance, that would be reasonably
likely to prevent the Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

"well-capitalized," as such term is defined in the applicable state and
federal rules and regulations.

directors of HCBF shall at all times prior to and during the HCBF Meeting
recommend approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of HCBF and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and any other matters
required to be approved by HCBF's shareholders for consummation of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "HCBF Recommendation") and shall
not withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or qualify such recommendation
in a manner adverse in any respect to the interests of CenterState or take any
other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with such
recommendation and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall include the HCBF
Recommendation. In the event that there is present at such meeting, in person
or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite HCBF
Shareholder Approval, HCBF will not adjourn or postpone the HCBF Meeting
unless HCBF is advised by counsel that failure to do so would result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of HCBF. HCBF shall
keep CenterState updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results in
connection with the HCBF Meeting as reasonably requested by CenterState.

 

(b)CenterState Shareholder Approval.

 

(i)Following the execution of this Agreement, CenterState shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law, applicable rules of NASDAQ and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of CenterState, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable to consider and vote
upon the issuance of CenterState Common Stock in the Merger as contemplated
hereby and any other matter required to be approved by the shareholders of
CenterState in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
"CenterState Meeting").

 

(ii)CenterState shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
CenterState Shareholder Approval to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall ensure that the CenterState
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies
solicited by CenterState in connection with the CenterState Meeting are
solicited in compliance with the FBCA, the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of CenterState, and all other applicable legal requirements.
CenterState shall keep HCBF updated with respect to the proxy solicitation
results in connection with the CenterState Meeting as reasonably requested by
HCBF. CenterState's board of directors shall recommend that CenterState's
shareholders vote to approve the issuance of the CenterState Common Stock in
the Merger as contemplated hereby and any other matters required to be
approved by CenterState's shareholders for consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "CenterState Recommendation"), and the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall include the CenterState Recommendation.

   

Section 5.05Registration Statement; Proxy Statement-Prospectus; NASDAQ
Listing.

 

(a)CenterState and HCBF agree to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement to be filed by CenterState with the SEC in connection
with the issuance of CenterState Common Stock in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all related
documents). HCBF shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to
CenterState such financial statements and related analysis of HCBF, including
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" of HCBF, as may be required in order to file the Registration
Statement, and any other report required to be filed by CenterState with the
SEC, in each case, in compliance with applicable Laws, and shall, as promptly
as practicable following execution of this Agreement, prepare and deliver
drafts of such information to CenterState to review. Each of CenterState and
HCBF agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. CenterState also agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities
Law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. HCBF agrees to cooperate with CenterState and
CenterState's counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate
opinions, consents and letters from HCBF's independent auditors in connection
with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus. After the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, HCBF,
at its own expense, shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders. 

 

(b)CenterState will advise HCBF, promptly after CenterState receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of CenterState Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff. CenterState
will provide HCBF and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and
all responses to requests for additional information by and replies to
comments of the SEC prior to filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC,
and CenterState will provide HCBF and its counsel with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the HCBF Meeting there
shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement, CenterState
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file
such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under applicable Law)
and cooperate with HCBF to mail such amendment or supplement to HCBF
shareholders (if required under applicable Law).

 

(c)CenterState will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be approved for listing on
NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

   

Section 5.06Regulatory Filings; Consents.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and HCBF and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts (i) to prepare all
documentation (including the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus), to effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Regulatory
Approvals and all other consents and approvals of a Governmental Authority
required to consummate the Merger in the manner contemplated herein,
including, without limitation, the final consent of the FDIC to the
assignment, assumption and transfer of all purchase and assumption and related
loss-share agreements, that have not been terminated, between Harbor Community
Bank and the FDIC, as receiver and acting in its corporate capacity
(collectively, the "FDIC Agreements"), to CenterState and CenterState Bank,
(ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations and (iii) to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously as practicable; provided,
however, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries or HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action,
or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Authority that would reasonably be likely
to have a material and adverse effect (measured on a scale relative to HCBF)
on the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, liquidity,
assets or deposit liabilities, properties or business of CenterState, HCBF,
the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Bank, after giving effect to the Merger
("Burdensome Condition"); provided, further, that those actions set forth on
CenterState Disclosure Schedule 5.06 shall not constitute a "Burdensome
Condition." CenterState and HCBF will furnish each other and each other's
counsel with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
directors, trustees, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may
be necessary or advisable in connection with any application, petition or any
other statement or application made by or on behalf of CenterState or HCBF to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party shall have the right to review and approve in
advance all characterizations of the information relating to such party and
any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority.
In addition, CenterState and HCBF shall each furnish to the other for review a
copy of each such filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority prior to its filing.

 

(b)HCBF will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and CenterState shall
reasonably cooperate with HCBF at HCBF's request, to obtain all consents,
approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described on HCBF
Disclosure Schedule 3.12(c). Each Party will notify the other Party promptly
and shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of notices or other
communications received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such Party, its
Subsidiaries or its representatives). HCBF will consult with CenterState and
its representatives as often as practicable under the circumstances so as to
permit HCBF and CenterState and their respective representatives to cooperate
to take appropriate measures to obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any
adverse consequences that may result from the foregoing. 

   

Section 5.07Publicity. CenterState and HCBF shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other Party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after such
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such
press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of counsel
be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchanges. It is
understood that CenterState shall assume primary responsibility for the
preparation of joint press releases relating to this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.08Access; Current Information.

 

(a)For the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the
other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, HCBF agrees
to afford CenterState and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours at
any time and from time to time throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time to HCBF's and its Subsidiaries' books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), information
technology systems, business, properties and personnel and to such other
information relating to them as CenterState may reasonably request and HCBF
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate
notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with applicable Law and
HCBF's privacy policy and, during such period, HCBF shall furnish to
CenterState, upon CenterState's reasonable request, all such other information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of HCBF and its Subsidiaries
that is substantially similar in scope to the information provided to
CenterState in connection with its diligence review prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 

(b)As promptly as reasonably practicable after they become available, HCBF
will furnish to CenterState copies of the board packages distributed to the
board of directors of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries, and minutes from the
meetings thereof, copies of any internal management financial control reports
showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period, and
copies of any reports provided to the board of directors of HCBF or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of
HCBF.

 

(c)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, at
the reasonable request of either Party, the other Party will cause one or more
of its designated representatives to confer with representatives of the
requesting Party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of
the other Party and its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, HCBF
agrees to provide to CenterState (i) a copy of each report filed by HCBF or
any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority, (ii) a copy of HCBF's
monthly loan trial balance, and (iii) a copy of HCBF's monthly statement of
condition and profit and loss statement and, if requested by CenterState, a
copy of HCBF's daily statement of condition and daily profit and loss
statement, in each case, which shall be provided as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it is filed or prepared, as applicable

   

(d)No investigation by CenterState or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of HCBF
set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective obligations
of CenterState and HCBF to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.08, HCBF shall
not be required to copy CenterState on any documents that disclose
confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information filed under a claim of confidentiality (including any confidential
supervisory information) or any other matter that HCBF's board of directors
has been advised by counsel that such distribution to CenterState may violate
a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or
may result in a waiver of HCBF's attorney-client privilege. In the event any
of the restrictions in this Section 5.08(e) shall apply, HCBF shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers,
decrees and approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating
to documents prepared or held by third parties (including work papers), the
Parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

 

Section 5.09No Solicitation by HCBF; Superior Proposals.

 

(a)HCBF shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and will not authorize
any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates or other agents of HCBF or any of HCBF's Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "HCBF Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than
CenterState) any information or data with respect to HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release
any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which HCBF is a party; or
(iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the HCBF Representatives, whether or not such HCBF
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such HCBF Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of HCBF or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by HCBF. HCBF and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause each of the HCBF Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from CenterState),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

   

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction
pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether
through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, a
significant portion of the assets of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries; (C) any
issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding
securities of HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party or group
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of HCBF or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form,
substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination
of the foregoing. 

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries, the shareholders of such third party)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding HCBF
Common Stock or more than 50% of the assets of HCBF and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and
(ii) that the board of directors of HCBF reasonably determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (A) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such Acquisition Proposal,
and (B) taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by
CenterState in response to such Acquisition Proposal, as contemplated by
Section 5.09(c), and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such takeover proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the
person making such proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of HCBF
from a financial point of view than the Merger.

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to the date of the HCBF Meeting, HCBF may take any of the actions
described in Section 5.09(a) if, but only if, (i) HCBF has received a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of Section 5.09(a); (ii) the board of directors of HCBF reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (B) it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to HCBF's shareholders under applicable Law;
(iii) HCBF has provided CenterState with at least three (3) Business Days'
prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording
access to any information or data with respect to HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, HCBF receives
from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
HCBF than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with CenterState.
HCBF shall promptly provide to CenterState any non-public information
regarding HCBF or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not
previously provided to CenterState, such additional information to be provided
no later than the date of provision of such information to such other party.

   

(c)HCBF shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
CenterState in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, HCBF or the HCBF Representatives, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement). HCBF agrees that it shall keep
CenterState informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms
of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

 

(d)Neither the board of directors of HCBF nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify, in a manner adverse to CenterState in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the HCBF
Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the HCBF Recommendation within three (3)
Business Days following a request by CenterState, or make any statement,
filing or release, in connection with the HCBF Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the HCBF Recommendation (it being understood that taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall
be considered an adverse modification of the HCBF Recommendation); (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause HCBF or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition Transaction (other
than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.09(b)) or (B) requiring HCBF to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(d), prior to the date of the HCBF Meeting, the
board of directors of HCBF may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the HCBF
Recommendation (a "HCBF Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th)
Business Day following CenterState's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of
Superior Proposal") from HCBF advising CenterState that the board of directors
of HCBF has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that it received (that did not result from a breach of Section 5.09(a))
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the board of directors of
HCBF has determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary
duties to HCBF's shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by
CenterState (the "Notice Period"), HCBF and the board of directors of HCBF
shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with CenterState to make
such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable HCBF to proceed with the HCBF Recommendation
without a HCBF Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that CenterState
shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end
of the Notice

   

Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been proposed by CenterState since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the board of directors of HCBF has again in good faith made
the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 5.09(e) and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, HCBF shall be required to deliver
a new Notice of Superior Proposal to CenterState and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.09(e), except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 

(f)Notwithstanding any HCBF Subsequent Determination, this Agreement shall be
submitted to HCBF's shareholders at the HCBF Meeting for the purpose of voting
on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
HCBF of such obligation; provided, however, that if the board of directors of
HCBF shall have made a HCBF Subsequent Determination with respect to a
Superior Proposal, then the board of directors of HCBF may recommend approval
of such Superior Proposal by the shareholders of HCBF and may submit this
Agreement to HCBF's shareholders without recommendation, in which event the
board of directors of HCBF shall communicate the basis for its recommendation
of such Superior Proposal and the basis for its lack of a recommendation with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to HCBF's
shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto.

 

(g)Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall prohibit HCBF or the board of
directors of HCBF from complying with HCBF's obligations required under Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such
disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the HCBF Recommendation
unless the board of directors of HCBF reaffirms the HCBF Recommendation in
such disclosure.

 

Section 5.10Indemnification. 

 

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in any
event subject to the provisions of Section 5.10(b)(iv), CenterState shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of
HCBF and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the
course of performing their duties for HCBF or such Subsidiary occurring at or
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a "Claim"), to the same extent as such persons have the right
to be indemnified pursuant to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of HCBF
or similar governing documents of such Subsidiary in effect on the date of
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.10 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that, failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of CenterState
under this Section 5.10, unless, and only to the

   

extent that, CenterState is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim
as a consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) CenterState shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and CenterState shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) CenterState shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) CenterState
shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such
indemnification would be in violation of any applicable federal or state
banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that a federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations, whether or not related to
banking Laws.

 

(c)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, CenterState
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide director's and
officer's liability insurance (herein, "DandO Insurance") that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of HCBF or its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as
that coverage currently provided by HCBF; provided that, if CenterState is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.10,
CenterState will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this Section
5.10(c)); and provided, further, that officers and directors of HCBF or its
Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall CenterState be
required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by HCBF for DandO Insurance in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If
the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium,
CenterState shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 

(d)If CenterState or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

Section 5.11Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are full time employees of HCBF or any of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the

   

aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-
discriminatory basis to similarly situated employees of CenterState or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided, however, that in no event shall any
Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of
CenterState or its Subsidiaries. CenterState shall give the Covered Employees
full credit for their prior service with HCBF and its Subsidiaries (i) for
purposes of eligibility (including initial participation and eligibility for
current benefits) and vesting under any qualified or non-qualified employee
benefit plan maintained by CenterState and in which Covered Employees may be
eligible to participate and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit
plans, vacation plans, severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by
CenterState.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan of CenterState that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, CenterState or its applicable Subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such CenterState or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been
covered under the HCBF Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any
health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable copayment, deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental,
vision or other welfare plan.

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, HCBF shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by CenterState that may be
necessary or appropriate to, conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective
Time, (i) cause one or more HCBF Benefits Plans to terminate as of the

other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 5.11(c) shall be subject to CenterState's
reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d)Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to limit the right of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
HCBF and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any HCBF Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 5.11 be construed to require CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, HCBF and its Subsidiaries) to retain
the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date, and the continued retention (or termination) by
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries of any Covered

   

Employee subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject in all events to
CenterState's or its applicable Subsidiary's normal and customary employment
procedures and practices, including customary background screening and
evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance.

 

(e)If, within six (6) months after the Effective Time, any Covered Employee is
terminated by CenterState or its Subsidiaries other than "for cause" or as a
result of unsatisfactory job performance, then CenterState shall pay severance
to such Covered Employee in an amount equal to two (2) weeks of base salary
for each twelve (12) months of such Covered Employee's prior employment with
HCBF or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that in no event will the total
amount of severance for any single Covered Employee be less than four (4)
weeks of such base salary nor greater than twenty-six (26) weeks of such base

and its Subsidiaries as then in effect.

 

(f)At the Effective Time, CenterState shall assume the obligations of HCBF

with respect to vesting.

 

(g)At the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all employees
of HCBF and its Subsidiaries and all accrued and unused vacation time for all
employees of HCBF and its Subsidiaries shall be accorded such treatment as set
forth in CenterState Disclosure Schedule 5.11(g). HCBF Disclosure Schedule
5.11(g) sets forth accrued sick time payment information as of July 31, 2017.

 

(h)Prior to the Effective Time, HCBF shall (i) cause the termination of all
salary continuation and supplemental executive retirement plans, programs and
agreements between HCBF and/or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer or
employee, and (ii) pay all amounts due its officers, directors and employees
pursuant to the change in control provisions applicable under any HCBF Benefit
Plan. HCBF Disclosure Schedule 5.11(h) sets forth all payments to be made by
HCBF pursuant to this Section 5.11(h).

 

Section 5.12Notification of Certain Changes. CenterState and HCBF shall
promptly advise the other Party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it believes
would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries' representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein and HCBF shall provide on a periodic
basis written notice to CenterState of any matters that HCBF becomes aware of
that should be disclosed on a supplement or amendment to the HCBF Disclosure
Schedule; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 5.12
or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or
Section 6.03 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.01, Section 6.02 or Section 6.03 to be satisfied.

   

Section 5.13Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after the
date hereof, CenterState and HCBF will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate the integration of HCBF with the business of CenterState
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data
processing and related electronic informational systems of HCBF and each of

CenterState, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of HCBF and each of
its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time, of
personal property leases and software licenses used by HCBF and each of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion;
(d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or
self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and

Effective Time. CenterState shall promptly reimburse HCBF on request for any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that HCBF
may incur as a result of taking, at the request of CenterState, any action
prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the Informational Systems
Conversion.

 

Section 5.14No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give CenterState, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of HCBF or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give HCBF, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of CenterState or
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of HCBF and CenterState shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

Section 5.15Certain Litigation. Each Party shall promptly advise the other
Party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened shareholder litigation
against such Party and/or the members of the board of directors of HCBF or the
board of directors of CenterState related to this Agreement or the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. HCBF shall: (i) permit
CenterState to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of CenterState in connection with, any proposed written or oral response
to such shareholder litigation; (ii) furnish CenterState's outside legal
counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which outside
counsel may reasonably request in connection with such shareholder litigation;
(iii) consult with CenterState regarding the defense or settlement of any such
shareholder litigation, shall give due consideration to CenterState's advice
with respect to such shareholder litigation and shall not settle any such
litigation prior to such consultation and consideration; provided, however,
that HCBF shall not settle any such shareholder litigation if such settlement
requires the payment of money damages, without the written consent of
CenterState (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless the payment of any such damages by HCBF is reasonably expected
by HCBF, following consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered
(disregarding any deductible to be paid by HCBF) under HCBF's existing
director and officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

 

Section 5.16Director Resignations. HCBF will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to CenterState resignations of all the

respectively. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of HCBF and
CenterState shall meet from time to time as CenterState may reasonably
request, and in any event not less frequently than monthly, to review the
financial and operational affairs of HCBF and its Subsidiaries, and HCBF shall
give due consideration to CenterState's input on such matters, with the
understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, neither CenterState nor CenterState Bank shall under any
circumstance be permitted to exercise control of HCBF or any of its

CenterState Bank to be onsite at HCBF to facilitate integration of operations
and assist with any other coordination efforts as necessary.

 

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, HCBF and its
Subsidiaries shall take any actions CenterState may reasonably request in
connection with negotiating any amendments, modifications or terminations of
any Leases or HCBF Material Contracts that CenterState may request, including,
but not limited to, actions necessary to cause any such amendments,
modifications or terminations to become effective prior to, or immediately
upon, the Closing, and shall cooperate with CenterState and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate specific provisions that may be
requested by CenterState in connection with any such amendment, modification
or termination.

 

(c)From and after the date hereof, subject to applicable Laws, the parties
shall reasonably cooperate with the other in preparing for the prompt
conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations promptly after
the Effective Time (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-
disclosure and similar agreements with the other party and appropriate service
providers) and HCBF shall, upon CenterState's reasonable request, introduce
CenterState and its representatives to suppliers of HCBF and its Subsidiaries
for the purpose of facilitating the integration of HCBF and its business into

shall, upon CenterState's reasonable request, introduce CenterState and its
representatives to customers of HCBF and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of
facilitating the integration of HCBF and its business into that of
CenterState. Any interaction between CenterState and HCBF's and any of its
Subsidiaries' customers and suppliers shall be coordinated by HCBF. HCBF shall

HCBF's customers and suppliers.

applicable Laws and the terms of the Plan of Bank Merger immediately following
the Effective Time or as promptly as practicable thereafter.

Schedule 3.35 a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees that HCBF and
its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "HCBF
Expenses"). HCBF shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
aggregate amount of all HCBF Expenses to not exceed the total expenses
disclosed in HCBF Disclosure Schedule 3.35. HCBF shall promptly notify
CenterState if or when it determines that it expects to exceed its budget for
HCBF Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.20,
HCBF shall not incur any investment banking, brokerage, finders or other
similar financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than those expressly set forth in HCBF
Disclosure Schedule 3.35.

 

Section 5.21Confidentiality. Prior to the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the consummation of the Merger, subject to applicable Laws, each of
CenterState and HCBF, and their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,
directors, agents, employees, consultants and advisors have provided, and will
continue to provide one another with information which may be deemed by the
party providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or
confidential, including, but not limited to, trade secrets of the disclosing
party. Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to,
hold any information obtained pursuant to this Article V in accordance with
the terms of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, dated as of
April 14, 2017 between CenterState and HCBF.

 

Section 5.22Tax Matters. The Parties intend that the Merger and the Bank
Merger shall each qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Regulations.
Except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, from and
after the date of this Agreement, each of CenterState and HCBF shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Merger and the Bank
Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and will not take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or
failure to act is intended or is reasonably likely to prevent either the
Merger or the Bank Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 5.23Loss Share Agreements. HCBF will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate or consummate a settlement with the FDIC regarding HCBF
or its Subsidiaries' buy-out of its outstanding recovery sharing rights under
the FDIC Agreements prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.24Retention Bonus Payments. CenterState shall pay to the individuals
set forth on HCBF Disclosure Schedule Section 5.24 (each a "Retention Bonus
Recipient") the cash retention bonus payments set forth on HCBF Disclosure
Schedule Section 5.24, subject to required tax withholdings (the "CenterState
Retention Bonus"). The CenterState Retention

   

Bonus shall be payable through CenterState's payroll system in a single lump
sum (a) in the case of employees, on the earlier of (i) the ninetieth (90th)
day following the Closing, but only if the Retention Bonus Recipient continues
to be employed by CenterState or its Subsidiaries on such date or (ii) the
date on which the Retention Bonus Recipient's employment with CenterState or
its Subsidiaries is terminated by CenterState or such Subsidiary without
"cause," by the Retention Bonus Recipient for "good reason" or on account of
the Retention Bonus Recipient's death or "disability" (as such terms are
defined in the agreement memorializing the CenterState Retention Bonus, which
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to each of HCBF and CenterState), but
only if such termination occurs following the Closing, or (b) in the case of
non-employee directors, at the Closing.

be automatically extended to August 12, 2018, if the only outstanding

(c)Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each Party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.03.

 

Section 9.04Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02, each
Party will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of its
own financial consultants, accountants and counsel. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall limit either Party's rights to recover any liabilities or
damages arising out of the other Party's willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

 

Section 9.05Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder
to a Party, shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly given if
delivered (a) personally, (b) by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested), with adequate postage prepaid thereon, (c) by properly addressed
electronic mail delivery (with confirmation of delivery receipt), or (d) by
reputable courier service to such Party at its address set forth below, or at
such other address or addresses as such Party may specify from time to time by
notice in like manner to the Parties. All notices shall be deemed effective

Section 9.06Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement represents the entire understanding of the Parties and thereto with
reference to the transactions contemplated hereby, and this Agreement
supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made.
Except for the Indemnified Parties' rights under Section 5.10, the right of
HCBF to select the HCBF Designee under Section 1.04 (which may be exercised by
the HCBF Designee), and the Retention Bonus Recipient's rights under Section
5.24, CenterState and

   

HCBF hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Party, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person (including any person
or employees who might be affected by Section 5.11), other than the Parties,
any rights or remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations between the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Consequently, Persons
other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in
this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Section 9.07Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.08Enforcement of the Agreement. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction without having to show or prove
economic damages and without the requirement of posting a bond, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 9.09Interpretation.

 

(a)When a reference is made in this Agreement to sections, exhibits or
schedules, such reference shall be to a section of, or exhibit or schedule to,
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and captions
and headings contained in this Agreement are included solely for convenience
of reference; if there is any conflict between a caption or heading and the
text of this Agreement, the text shall control. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(b)The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated herein. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises under
any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or document
contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or documents
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
authorizing any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreements or
documents contemplated herein.

   

(c)The HCBF Disclosure Schedule and the CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as
well as all other schedules and all exhibits to this Agreement, shall be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
Any matter disclosed pursuant to any section of either Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of any other section of Article III or
Article IV, respectively, to the extent that applicability of the disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face, notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross-reference, of such disclosure. No item is
required to be set forth in either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect. The mere
inclusion of an item in either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by either party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
or that any breach or violation of applicable Laws or any contract exists or
has actually occurred. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed
to require any person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do
so would violate any applicable Law.

 

(d)Any reference contained in this Agreement to specific statutory or
regulatory provisions or to any specific Governmental Authority shall include
any successor statute or regulation, or successor Governmental Authority, as
the case may be. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be deemed to be interchangeable,
and the singular includes the plural and vice versa. As used herein, (i) the
term "made available" means any document or other information that was (a)
provided by one party or its representatives to the other party or its
representatives prior to the date hereof or (b) included in the virtual data
room of a party prior to the date hereof, and (ii) the word "or" is not
exclusive.

 

(e)Unless otherwise specified, the references to "Section" and "Article" in
this Agreement are to the Sections and Article of this Agreement. When used
in this Agreement, words such as "herein", "hereinafter", "hereof", "hereto",
and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise.

 

Section 9.10Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Party, and any purported assignment in violation of this
Section 9.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.11Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all Parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile or by
electronic data file shall have the same effect as originals.

EXHIBIT A

 

FORM OF

 

HCBF VOTING AGREEMENT

 



 

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is dated as of August 12, 2017, by
and between the undersigned holder ("Shareholder") of common stock of HCBF
Holding Company, Inc., a Florida corporation ("HCBF"), and CenterState Banks,
Inc., a Florida corporation ("CenterState"). All capitalized terms used but
not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement (defined below).

 

RECITALS:

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CenterState and
HCBF are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as such agreement may
be subsequently amended or modified, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which (i) HCBF will merge with and into CenterState, with CenterState as the
surviving entity, and (ii) Harbor Community Bank, a Florida-state chartered
bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of HCBF ("Harbor Community Bank") will merge
with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and
wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank"), with CenterState
Bank as the surviving bank (collectively, the "Merger"), and in connection
with the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of HCBF, $0.001 par
value per share ("HCBF Common Stock"), will be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock;

 

WHEREAS, Shareholder "beneficially owns" (as such term is defined in Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and
is entitled to dispose of (or direct the disposition of) and to vote (or
direct the voting of) directly or indirectly the number of shares of HCBF
Common Stock indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the
heading "Total Number of Shares of HCBF Common Stock Subject to this Agreement
(other than Section 1)" (such shares, together with any additional shares of
HCBF Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this
Agreement, including through the exercise of any stock option or other equity
award, warrant or similar instrument, being referred to collectively as the
"Shares"); and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material inducement to the willingness of CenterState to
enter into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT:

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by CenterState in connection therewith,
Shareholder and CenterState agree as follows:

 

1

   

Section 1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that, while this
Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of HCBF, however
called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which
Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as
otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by CenterState, Shareholder shall:

 

(a)appear at each such meeting in person or by proxy or otherwise cause the
Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum;
and

 

(b)vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to
which the Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct
the voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or
modifications of the terms thereof approved by the board of directors of HCBF
and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof); (ii) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies to approve the Merger Agreement; (iii) against any action
or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of HCBF contained in the Merger
Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (iv) against any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any other action,
agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to
impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or
materially and adversely affect consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement.

 

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of HCBF, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The parties hereto agree that, solely for purposes of this Section 1, the term
"Shares" shall mean the number of shares of HCBF Common Stock indicated on the
signature page of this Agreement under the heading "Total Number of Shares of
HCBF Common Stock Subject to Section 1 of this Agreement" "beneficially owned"
(as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by Shareholder. 

 

Section 2. No Transfers. Until the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6 and (ii) receipt of the Requisite HCBF
Shareholder Approval, Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell,
transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract
option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the
sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares,
except the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of Law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement, and (d) such transfers as CenterState may otherwise
permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation
of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.

 

2

   

Section 3.Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(a)Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles.

 



 

(c)The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or,
in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other
entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

 



 

(d)Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of, or is the trustee that
is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of,
and has good title to all of the Shares, and the Shares are owned free and
clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other encumbrances. The
Shares do not include shares over which Shareholder exercises control in a
fiduciary capacity for any other person or entity that is not an Affiliate of
Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is made with respect
thereto. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and none of the Shares
is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction
with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this
Agreement. Shareholder does not own, of record or beneficially, any shares of
capital stock of HCBF other than the Shares or any other securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, other
than any HCBF Stock Option.

 

Section 4. No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6, Shareholder, in his, her
or its capacity as a shareholder of HCBF, shall not, nor shall such
Shareholder authorize any partner, officer, director, advisor or
representative of, such Shareholder or any of his, her or its Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly (and, to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such
Shareholder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prohibit any of his,
her or its representatives or Affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or
knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any person (other than CenterState) any information or data
with respect to HCBF or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c)
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any

 

3

   

agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist
any party in taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain
or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, or (e) initiate a
shareholders' vote or action by consent of HCBF's shareholders with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 5. Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter
into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement
and that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState
if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will not have an
adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any
such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
CenterState has an adequate remedy at Law. Shareholder further agrees that
Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with CenterState's seeking or
obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with
Shareholder, CenterState shall have the right to inform any third party that
CenterState reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating
with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement with CenterState set forth
in this Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such third
party.

 

Section 6. Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
by the mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time,
(b) the amendment of the Merger Agreement in any manner that materially and
adversely affects any of Shareholder's rights set forth therein (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any reduction to the Merger Consideration), (c)
termination of the Merger Agreement or (d) three (3) years from the date
hereof. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

 

Section 7.Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding
of the parties and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and this Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written
agreements heretofore made. 

 

Section 8.Modification and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be
modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge
is agreed to in writing signed by each party. No waiver by either party
hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance
with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such
other party shall be deemed a waiver of dissimilar provisions or conditions at
the same or any prior subsequent time.

 

4

   

Section 9.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder
solely in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of HCBF and it shall not
apply in any manner to Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as a director
of HCBF, if applicable. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of Shareholder to comply
with his, her or its fiduciary duties as a director of HCBF, if applicable.

 

Section 11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of
the State of Florida, without regard for conflict of law provisions.

 

Section 12. Jurisdiction. Any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in
the courts of record of the State of Florida in Polk County or the United
States District Court, Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the
jurisdiction of such Florida court in any such civil action, counterclaim,
proceeding, or litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida
court. Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as
provided in this letter, or in such other manner as may be provided under
applicable Laws.

 

Section 13.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.

 

5

   

Section 14.Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal
or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand fair value for his, her or its
Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case, that Shareholder may have
under applicable law. From time to time prior to the termination of this
Agreement, at CenterState's request and without further consideration,
Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all
such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Shareholder further agrees not to commence or participate in, and to take all
actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to,
any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState, CenterState Bank,
HCFB, Harbor Community Bank or any of their respective successors relating to
the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 15.Disclosure. Shareholder hereby authorizes HCBF and CenterState to
publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus such
Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of
Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that
CenterState shall provide Shareholder written drafts of any such disclosure
and consider in good faith Shareholder's comments thereto. 

 

Section 16.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile or by
electronic data file shall have the same effect as originals.

AGREEMENT:

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, HCBF
entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the transactions
contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be
incurred by HCBF in connection therewith, Shareholder and HCBF agree as
follows:

   

Section 1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that, while this
Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of CenterState, however
called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which
Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as
otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by HCBF, Shareholder shall:

 

(a)appear at each such meeting in person or by proxy or otherwise cause the
Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum;
and

 

(b)vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to
which the Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct
the voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or
modifications of the terms thereof approved by the board of directors of
CenterState and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof); (ii) in favor
of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting, if necessary, to solicit
additional proxies to approve the Merger Agreement; (iii) against any action
or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of CenterState contained in the
Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (iv)
against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any
other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably
be expected, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone,
discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement.

 

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of CenterState, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 2. No Transfers. Until the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5 and (ii) receipt of the Requisite CenterState
Shareholder Approval, Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell,
transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract
option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the
sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares,
except the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of Law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement, and (d) such transfers as HCBF may otherwise permit
in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the
terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.

 

Section 3.Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with HCBF as follows:

 

(a)Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

   

(b)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by HCBF, constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder enforceable against
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

 

(c)The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and
the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or,
in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other
entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.

 

(d)Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of, or is the trustee that
is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the beneficial owners of,
and has good title to all of the Shares, and the Shares are owned free and
clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other encumbrances. The
Shares do not include shares over which Shareholder exercises control in a
fiduciary capacity for any other person or entity that is not an Affiliate of
Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is made with respect
thereto. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and none of the Shares
is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction
with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this
Agreement. Shareholder does not own, of record or beneficially, any shares of
capital stock of CenterState other than the Shares or any other securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, other
than any CenterState Stock Option.

 

Section 4. Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of HCBF to enter into
the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to HCBF if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, HCBF will not have an adequate remedy
at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will
not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that HCBF has an adequate
remedy at Law. Shareholder further agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and
agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with HCBF's seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In
addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, HCBF shall have the
right to inform any third party that HCBF reasonably believes to be, or to be
contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder
assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and
of the rights of HCBF hereunder, and that participation by any such persons
with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement with
HCBF set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by HCBF against such
third party.

 

Section 5. Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to

   

consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and shall be automatically
terminated upon the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the
amendment of the Merger Agreement in any manner that materially and adversely
affects any of Shareholder's rights set forth therein, (c) termination of the
Merger Agreement or (d) three (3) years from the date hereof. Upon such
termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any
party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

 

Section 6.Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding
of the parties and thereto with reference to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and this Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written
agreements heretofore made. 

 

Section 7.Modification and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be
modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge
is agreed to in writing signed by each party. No waiver by either party
hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance
with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such
other party shall be deemed a waiver of dissimilar provisions or conditions at
the same or any prior subsequent time.

 

Section 8.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder
solely in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of CenterState and it
shall not apply in any manner to Shareholder in his, her or its capacity as a
director of CenterState, if applicable. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of
Shareholder to comply with his, her or its fiduciary duties as a director of
CenterState, if applicable.

 

Section 10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of
the State of Florida, without regard for conflict of law provisions.

 

Section 11. Jurisdiction. Any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in
the courts of record of the State of Florida in Polk County or the United
States District Court, Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the
jurisdiction of such Florida court in any such civil action, counterclaim,
proceeding, or litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida
court. Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as
provided in this letter, or in such other manner as may be provided under
applicable Laws.

   

Section 12.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.

 

Section 13.Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal
or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand fair value for his, her or its
Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case, that Shareholder may have
under applicable law. From time to time prior to the termination of this
Agreement, at HCBF's request and without further consideration, Shareholder
shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further
action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the actions and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Shareholder
further agrees not to commence or participate in, and to take all actions
necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any
claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState, CenterState Bank, HCFB,
Harbor Community Bank or any of their respective successors relating to the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 14.Disclosure. Shareholder hereby authorizes HCBF and CenterState to
publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus such
Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of
Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that
CenterState shall provide Shareholder written drafts of any such disclosure
and consider in good faith Shareholder's comments thereto. 

 

Section 15.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

No waiver, amendment, modification or change of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless and until made in writing and signed by

governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the

any right of action in or on behalf of any person or entity other than the

FORM OF

 

DIRECTOR NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"), is dated
as of August 12, 2017, by and between ________________________, an individual
resident of the State of __________ ("Director"), and CenterState Banks, Inc.,
a Florida corporation ("CenterState"). All capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement (defined below).

 

RECITALS:

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CenterState and
HCBF Holding Company, Inc., a Florida corporation ("HCBF"), are entering into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as such agreement may be subsequently amended
or modified, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which (i) HCBF will merge
with and into CenterState, with CenterState as the surviving entity, and (ii)
Harbor Community Bank, a Florida-state chartered bank and wholly-owned
subsidiary of HCBF ("Harbor Community Bank") will merge with and into
CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and wholly-owned
subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank"), with CenterState Bank as the
surviving bank (collectively, the "Merger");

 

WHEREAS, Director is a shareholder of HCBF and, as a result of the Merger and
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Director is
expected to receive consideration in exchange for the shares of HCBF Common
Stock held by Director;

 



 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
Board of Directors of HCBF or Harbor Community Bank, and, therefore, Director
may have knowledge of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (each as
hereinafter defined);

 



 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, for which CenterState, as of the
Effective Time, will have paid valuable consideration and desires reasonable
protection; and

 



 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
each director of HCBF and Harbor Community Bank, including Director, enter
into this Agreement.

 



 

AGREEMENT:

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending to
be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 



   

Section 1. Restrictive Covenants.

 

(a)Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for the
restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods of
restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

 

(b)Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(i)From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use any
Confidential Information or Trade Secrets for so long as such information
remains Confidential Information or a Trade Secret, as applicable, for any
purpose, except for any disclosure that is required by applicable Law. In the
event that Director is required by Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, Director will: (A) if and to the extent permitted by such Law
provide CenterState with prompt notice of such requirement prior to the
disclosure so that CenterState may waive the requirements of this Agreement or
seek an appropriate protective order at CenterState's sole expense; and (B)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential
Information disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. If, in the
absence of a waiver or protective order, Director is nonetheless, in the
opinion of his or her counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information,
disclosure may be made only as to that portion of the Confidential Information
that counsel advises Director is required to be disclosed.

 

(ii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year after the Effective
Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent
of CenterState), on Director's own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of CenterState, CenterState
Bank, HCBF or Harbor Community Bank (each a "Protected Party"), including
actively sought prospective customers of Harbor Community Bank as of the
Effective Time, in each case with whom Director had material contact on behalf
of HCBF or Harbor Community Bank in the course of Director's service as a
director of HCBF or Harbor Community Bank, as applicable, for the purpose of
providing products or services that are Competitive (as hereinafter defined)
with those offered or provided by any Protected Party as of the date hereof.

 

(iii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Director's
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any banking business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the banking business conducted by any Protected Party
and which has a banking office located within the Restricted Territory as of
the date hereof.

   

(iv)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending one (1) year after
the Effective Time, Director will not, on Director's own behalf or in the
service or on behalf of others, solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or
recruit, directly or by assisting others, any employee in a managerial, sales,
executive or supervisory capacity of any Protected Party, whether or not such
employment is pursuant to a written agreement and whether or not such
employment is for a determined period or is at will, to cease working for such
Protected Party; provided that the foregoing will not prevent the placement of
any general solicitation for employment not specifically directed towards
employees of any Protected Party or hiring any such person as a result
thereof.

 

(c)For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as set
forth below:

 

(i)"Competitive," with respect to particular products or services, means
products or services that are the same as or similar to the products or
services of any Protected Party.

 

(ii)"Confidential Information" means data and information: 

 

(A)relating to the business of HCBF and its Subsidiaries, including Harbor
Community Bank, regardless of whether the data or information constitutes a
Trade Secret;

 



 

(B)disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence of
Director's relationship with HCBF and/or Harbor Community Bank;

 



 

(C)having value to HCBF and/or Harbor Community Bank and, as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
CenterState and/or CenterState Bank; and

 



 

(D)not generally known to competitors of HCBF or CenterState.

 

Confidential Information shall include Trade Secrets, methods of operation,
names of customers, price lists, financial information and projections,
personnel data and similar information; provided, however, that the terms
"Confidential Information" and "Trade Secrets" shall not mean data or
information that (x) has been disclosed to the public, except where such
public disclosure has been made by Director without authorization from HCBF or
CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by others, or
(z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

 

(iii)"Restricted Territory" means each county in Florida where Harbor
Community Bank operates a banking office at the Effective Time and each county
contiguous to each of such counties.

   

(iv)"Trade Secret" means information, without regard to form, including
technical or nontechnical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a
program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial
data, financial plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential
customers or suppliers, that is not commonly known by or available to the
public and which information:

 

(A)derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

 



 

(B)is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy.

 

(d) Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable Law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by Law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

Section 2.Term; Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by
the written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (i) termination of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) two (2) years following the Effective Time or (iii) upon a
Change in Control of CenterState (as defined in Schedule I). For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of Section 1 shall only become operative upon the
consummation of the Merger but, in such event, shall survive the consummation
of the Merger until the earlier of (a) two (2) years after the Effective Time
(except Sections (1)(b)(ii) - (iv), which shall terminate one (1) year after
the Effective Time) or (b) upon a Change in Control of CenterState. Upon
termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities hereunder, except that termination of this Agreement will not
relieve a breaching party from liability for any breach of any provision of
this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement.

   

Section 3.Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder
to a party, shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly given if
delivered (a) personally, (b) by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested), with adequate postage prepaid thereon, (c) by properly addressed
electronic mail delivery (with confirmation of delivery receipt), or (d) by
reputable courier service to such party at its address set forth below, or at
such other address or addresses as such party may specify from time to time by
notice in like manner to the parties hereto. All notices shall be deemed
effective upon delivery.

Concerning claims which the undersigned may have against HCBF or any of its
subsidiaries, including Harbor Community Bank (each, an "HCBF Entity"), in his
or her capacity as an officer, director or employee of any HCBF Entity, and in
consideration of the promises, and the mutual covenants contained herein and
in the Merger Agreement and the mutual benefits to be derived hereunder and
thereunder, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the undersigned, intending to be
legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:

 

Section 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this letter, capitalized

Section 2. Release of Certain Claims.

 

(a)The undersigned hereby releases and forever discharges, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each HCBF Entity,
and each of their respective directors and officers (in their capacities as
such), and their respective successors and assigns, and each of them
(hereinafter, individually and collectively, the "Released Parties") of and
from any and all liabilities, claims, demands, debts, accounts, covenants,
agreements, obligations, costs, expenses, actions or causes of action of every
nature, character or description (collectively, "Claims"), which the
undersigned, solely in his or her capacity as an officer, director or employee
of any HCBF Entity has or claims to have, or previously had or claimed to
have, in each case as of the Effective Time, against any of the Released
Parties, whether or not in law, equity or otherwise, based in whole or in part
on any facts, conduct, activities, transactions, events or occurrences known
or unknown, matured or unmatured, contingent or otherwise (individually a
"Released Claim," and collectively, the "Released Claims"), except for (i)
compensation for services that have accrued but have not yet been paid in the
ordinary course of

   

business consistent with past practice or other contract rights relating to
severance, employment, stock options and restricted stock grants which have
been disclosed in writing to CenterState on or prior to the date of the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) the items listed in Section 2(b) below.

 



 

(b)For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Released
Claims do not include any of the following:

officer, director or employee of any HCBF Entity, including, but not limited

the Merger Agreement; or

 



 

(v)any rights or Claims listed on Schedule I to this Agreement.

 

Section 3.Forbearance. The undersigned shall forever refrain and forebear from
commencing, instituting or prosecuting any lawsuit, action, claim or
proceeding before or in any court, regulatory, governmental, arbitral or other
authority to collect or enforce any Released Claims which are released and
discharged hereby.

 

Section 4.Miscellaneous.

 

(a)This letter shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in
accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of the State of Florida,
without regard for conflict of law provisions.

 

(b)This letter contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Released Claims released hereby, and the release of Claims contained in
this letter supersedes all prior agreements, arrangement or understandings
(written or otherwise) with respect to such Released Claims and no
representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, has been made
by or relied upon by any party hereto, except as expressly contained herein or
in the Merger Agreement.

 

(c)This letter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
undersigned and the Released Parties and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns.

   

(d)This letter may not be modified, amended or rescinded except by the written
agreement of the undersigned and the Released Parties, it being the express
understanding of the undersigned and the Released Parties that no term hereof
may be waived by the action, inaction or course of delaying by or between the
undersigned or the Released Parties, except in strict accordance with this
paragraph, and further that the waiver of any breach of the terms of this
letter shall not constitute or be construed as the waiver of any other breach
of the terms hereof.

 

(e)The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants that the undersigned is
fully aware of the undersigned's rights to discuss any and all aspects of this
matter with any attorney chosen by him or her, and that the undersigned has
carefully read and fully understands all the provisions of this letter, and
that the undersigned is voluntarily entering into this letter.

 

(f)This letter shall become effective upon the consummation of the Merger, and
its operation to extinguish all of the Released Claims released hereby is not
dependent on or affected by the performance or non-performance of any future
act by the undersigned or the Released Parties (other than the failure of
CenterState to pay the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement). If
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, this letter shall be of no
force or effect.

 

(g)If any civil action, arbitration or other legal proceeding is brought for
the enforcement of this letter, or because of an alleged dispute, breach,
default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this letter,
the successful or prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, sales and use taxes and all expenses
even if not taxable as court costs (including, without limitation, all such
fees, taxes, costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate, bankruptcy
and post-judgment proceedings), incurred in that proceeding, in addition to
any other relief to which such party or parties may be entitled. Attorneys'
fees shall include, without limitation, paralegal fees, investigative fees,
administrative costs, sales and use taxes and all other charges billed by the
attorney to the prevailing party (including any fees and costs associated with
collecting such amounts).

 

(h)Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this letter is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and
therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this letter, or the
transactions contemplated by this letter. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each party has been induced to
enter into this letter by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section.

   

(i)Any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation arising out of or
relating to this letter shall be brought in the courts of record of the State
of Florida in Polk County or the United States District Court, Middle District
of Florida. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such Florida court in
any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation and waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such civil action, counterclaim,
proceeding, or litigation in such Florida court. Service of any court paper
may be effected on such party by mail, as provided in this letter, or in such
other manner as may be provided under applicable laws, rules of procedure or
local rules.
