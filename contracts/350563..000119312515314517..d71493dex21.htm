ARTICLE II

_EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND_

_BOOK-ENTRY SHARES_

 

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of
Company Common Stock; Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock:

 

(i) each share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Company (" _Company
Common Stock_ ") that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, if any, each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, if any, and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub, if any, immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) subject to _Section 2.01(b)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares to
be canceled and retired or converted in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(i)_
and Company Restricted Shares to be canceled and converted in accordance with
_Section 2.03(b)_) shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Merger
Consideration, payable as provided in _Section 2.02_, and, when so converted,
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist;

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities
convertible therefor or

 



3  exchangeable thereto) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, or any similar event, the Merger Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to
Parent, Merger Sub, and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

SECTION 2.02 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree upon and appoint a bank or trust company to act as paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall irrevocably
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock contemplated by _Section
2.01(a)(ii)_, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ (the " _Payment Fund_
").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than two (2) Business Days
after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of
record of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Certificate_ ") and to
each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "),
in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_:

(1) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, and

(2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares.

(ii) Upon surrender to, and acceptance in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)(iii)_ by, the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the
holder thereof will be entitled to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered under this Agreement.

(iii) The Paying Agent will accept Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with customary exchange practices.

 



4 (iv) From and after the Effective Time, no further transfers may be made on
the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and if any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the
Company for transfer, such Certificate of Book-Entry Share shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(v) If any Merger Consideration is to be remitted to a name other than that in
which a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, no Merger
Consideration may be paid in exchange for such surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share unless:

 

(1) either (A) the Certificate so surrendered is properly endorsed, with
signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer or (B) the
Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

(2) the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share or (B) establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(vi) At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated by
this  _Section 2.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)(ii)_. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. 

(i) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate, and each holder of
Book-Entry Shares, will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except, to the extent provided by _Section 2.01_,
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_;

 

(ii) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender or exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this  _Section 2.02_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



5 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent will deliver to the
Surviving Corporation, upon the Surviving Corporations demand, any portion
of the Payment Fund (including any interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the
former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration of the
period ending one (1) year after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares prior to the Merger who has not
complied with this  _Section 2.02_ prior to such time, may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of his, her or its claim for Merger
Consideration to which such holder may be entitled.

 

(e) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent;  _provided_ that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to,
and be the property of, Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment
of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Companys
shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as
provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such
investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to
be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted
Shares, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

(h)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made 

 



6  against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver
and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.03 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger
Consideration, without interest, over (2) the per-share exercise price for
such Company Stock Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (the " _Company
Stock Option Consideration_ "). All payments of Company Stock
Option Consideration shall be made by the Surviving Corporation, less
applicable Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and in all events no later than the later of (A) five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date and (B) the last day of the
Surviving Corporations first regular payroll cycle following the Closing
Date).

(b) Each Company Restricted Share and each Company Restricted Share Unit that
is granted after the date of this Agreement to non-employee directors of the
Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become vested as of the Effective Time and shall be cancelled and converted,
as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment
equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest (the " _Company Restricted
Share Consideration_ "). For purposes of determining the number of Company
Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
applicable performance objectives and bonus multipliers shall be deemed
achieved immediately prior to the Effective Time at the maximum payout level
(without giving effect to any proration). All payments of Company Restricted
Share Consideration (and the amount of any dividends associated with each such
Company Restricted Share or Company Restricted Share Unit, as applicable,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation, less applicable Tax withholdings, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (and in all events no later than the
later of (i) five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date and (ii) the
last day of the Surviving Corporations first regular payroll cycle following
the Closing).

 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 2.03(b)_, each Company Restricted Share
Unit that is granted after the date hereof that is not subject to performance
objectives and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to a prorated amount of the
Merger Consideration, without interest, and a Cash Service Award (as defined
in _Section 2.03(d)_). The amount of such cash payment shall equal the
product of (i) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus the amount of any
dividend equivalents associated with such Company Restricted Share Unit,
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the period beginning on January 1 of the year in which such Company
Restricted Share Unit was granted and ending on the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is 1,096. Such payment shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation, less applicable Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in all events no later than the later of
(x) five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date and (y) the last day of
the Surviving Corporations first regular payroll cycle following the
Closing).

 



7 (d) " _Cash Service Award_ " means a right to receive a cash payment in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus
the amount of any dividend equivalent associated with the applicable Company
Restricted Share Unit, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days during the period commencing on the day after the
Closing Date and ending on the last day of the vesting period applicable to
such Company Restricted Share Unit, and the denominator of which is 1,096.
Each Cash Service Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Share Unit as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Stock
Plan and award agreement, including vesting. Payment with respect to each
Cash Service Award shall be made by the Surviving Corporation, less applicable
Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the applicable vesting
date.

 

(e) Each Company Restricted Share Unit that is granted after the date hereof
that is subject to performance objectives and that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted, as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to a
prorated amount of the Merger Consideration, without interest, and
an Additional Cash Service Award (as defined in _Section 2.03(f)_). For
purposes of determining the number of such Company Restricted Shares Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, any applicable
performance objectives and bonus multipliers shall be deemed achieved
immediately prior to the Effective Time at the maximum payout level (without
giving effect to any proration). The amount of such cash payment shall equal
the product of (i) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus the amount of any
dividend equivalents associated with such Company Restricted Share Unit,
_multiplied_ by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the period beginning on January 1 of the year in which such Company
Restricted Share Unit was granted and ending on the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is 1,096. Such payment shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation, less applicable Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (and in all events no later than the later of (x)
five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date and (y) the last day of the
Surviving Corporations first regular payroll cycle following the Closing).

(f) " _Additional Cash Service Award_ " means a right to receive a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of the Merger
Consideration plus the amount of any dividend equivalent associated with the
applicable Company Restricted Share Unit, _multiplied_ by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the period commencing on the
day after the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the performance
period applicable for the performance vesting measurement established under
the award terms of such Company Restricted Share Unit, and the denominator of
which is 1,096. Each Additional Cash Service Award shall be subject to service
vesting (but not performance vesting) based on the service-based terms and
conditions that applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Share Unit as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Stock
Plan and award agreement. Payment with respect to each Additional Cash Service
Award shall be made by the Surviving Corporation, less applicable Tax
withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the applicable vesting
date.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for, and
shall take any other actions that are necessary to effect, the treatment of
the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares and the Company
Restricted Share Units as contemplated by this _Section 2.03_.

SECTION 3.06 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by the Company with
the SEC since January 1, 2014 (such documents, together will all exhibits,
financial statements, including the Company Financial Statements, and
schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference, but

 



12  excluding the Proxy Statement, being collectively referred to as the "

material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of

may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Companys consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability of any
nature that is required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except liabilities (i)
reflected or reserved against in the most recent balance sheet (including
the notes thereto) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries included in

reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. Except as has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents and (ii) the Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board
(1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f)

 



13  under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (2) any fraud, known to the Company, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

circumstance, effect, change, event or development that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

premium payments and other payments required to be made by the Company or any
Company Commonly Controlled Entity to any Company Benefit Plan have been made

Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Commonly 

 



15  Controlled Entity has engaged in, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there
has not been, any non-exempt transaction prohibited by ERISA or by Section
4975 of the Code with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement is under audit or is the subject of an
administrative proceeding by the IRS, the Department of Labor, or any
other Governmental Entity, nor is any such audit or other administrative
proceeding, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement that is subject to Section
302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. No Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement is a multiemployer plan, as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Company Commonly
Controlled Entity has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
such plan within the six years preceding this Agreement. Except for matters
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually

Liability (as defined below) that has not been satisfied in full nor do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Controlled Group Liability (except for the payment of premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation). For the purposes of this Agreement, "

IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412, 430
and 4971 of the Code or (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified and such plan has received a currently
effective favorable determination letter or opinion to that effect from the
IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why any such
determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued.

(f) Except for any liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability for
providing health, medical or other welfare benefits after retirement or other
termination of employment, except for coverage or benefits required to be
provided under Section 4980(B)(f) of the Code or applicable Law.

 

(g) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as set forth in _Section
3.09(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the performance by either party of its covenants and
agreements hereunder or the consummation of the Merger (alone or in
conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on
or following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle any Company Personnel to
any material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting,

 



16  or trigger any payment or funding, of any material compensation or benefit
or trigger any other material obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in any payment that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, not be deductible
under Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3.09_ are
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company relating
to Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements (including their
compliance with any applicable Law) or ERISA, and no other representation or
warranty of the Company contained herein shall be construed to relate
to Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements (including their
compliance with any applicable Law) or ERISA.

SECTION 3.10  _Labor and Employment Matters_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is party to any collective bargaining agreement or similar labor
union Contract with respect to any of their respective employees (the
Contracts set forth in _Section 3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the "
_Company Union Contracts_ "). To the Knowledge of the Company, no employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary are represented by any other labor
union with respect to their employment for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as would not have or would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

or certification proceedings with respect to employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pending or threatened in writing to be brought or filed
with the National Labor Relations Board, and (b) there are no labor union
organizing activities, with respect to employees of the Company or any Company

union strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts or other material labor
disputes pending or threatened in writing against or affecting the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.11 _Litigation_. There is no Claim before any Governmental Entity
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), initiate

affect the authorized capital structure or authorized return on equity of any
Company Subsidiary or materially affect the return on equity of any Company
Subsidiary in an adverse manner, with Governmental Entities and (c) initiate
any other proceeding with Governmental Entities in the ordinary course of
business (the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c), collectively, the "
_Proceedings_ ") and (d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
initiate any other proceedings with Governmental Entities or take any other
action contemplated by or described in any filings or other submissions filed
or submitted in connection with the Proceedings prior to the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will not enter into
any settlement or stipulation in respect of any Proceeding initiated prior to
the date of this Agreement if such settlement or stipulation would affect the
authorized capital structure or authorized return on equity of any Company
Subsidiaries or materially affect the return on equity of any Company
Subsidiary in an adverse manner.

 

SECTION 5.03 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize any of its Affiliates or
any of its and their respective officers, directors, principals, partners,
managers, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, consultants,
financial advisors or other authorized representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) directly or indirectly participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for the Companys
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives or Parent and Parents
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives) regarding, or
furnish to any such Person, any nonpublic information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any such Person with respect to, any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (except for the Companys Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives or Parent and Parents Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response

 



30  to the receipt of a _bona fide_ written Company Takeover Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement that does not result from a breach (other than an
immaterial breach) of this  _Section 5.03(a)_ by the Company and that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor) constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company and its Representatives
may (1) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with the provision of such information to such Person) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement and (2) participate in discussions
regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal, including terms of a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto, and the negotiation of
such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and
such Persons Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.03(a)_ by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates, in each case, at
the Companys direction, shall constitute a breach of this _Section 5.03(a)_
by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company
may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to the extent necessary to allow a confidential Company
Takeover Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as
the Company promptly notifies Parent thereof after granting any such waiver,
amendment or release.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section
5.03(e)_, and except for the public disclosure of a Recommendation Change
Notice, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any manner adverse to Parent,
or propose publicly to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the
Company Board Recommendation or (iv) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer (except for a recommendation against such offer or a
customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in the foregoing clauses
(i)(iv) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
"). Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_, _Section 5.03(c)_ and
_Section 5.03(e)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or commitment constituting,
or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal, or requiring, or that would reasonably be expected to cause, the
Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement (a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) a Company Intervening Event has
occurred or (ii) the Company has received a Superior Company Proposal that
does not result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach) of  _Section
5.03(a)_ by the Company and, in each case, if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial

 



31  advisor) that the failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
as a result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event or in response
to the receipt of such Superior Company Proposal, as the case may be, would
reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the Company Board
has provided prior written notice to Parent (a " _Recommendation Change
Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to the occurrence of a Company Intervening Event or the
receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, which notice shall, in the case of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the receipt of a Superior
Company Proposal, at the Companys option, either attach the most current
draft of any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Company Proposal or include a summary of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Company Proposal, (2) if requested by Parent, during the
three (3) Business Day period after delivery of the Recommendation Change
Notice, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement
committed to in writing by Parent and (3) at the end of such three (3)
Business Day period and taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement committed to in writing by Parent (it being understood and agreed
that if Parent has committed in writing to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement and there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of
such Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board shall provide a new
Recommendation Change Notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period
from the date of such notice shall apply), the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor) that the failure to make such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than the later of
(i) twenty-four (24) hours or (ii) 5 p.m. New York City time on the next
Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects on a reasonably current basis of the material terms and
status (including any change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover
Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Company from
(i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in
the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably likely be inconsistent
with its obligations under applicable Law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing), with respect to any (1) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, (2) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way
of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity

 



32  interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 30% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (3) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the shareholders of any Person) or
group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing
30% or more of the voting power of the Company, (4) transaction (including any
tender offer or exchange offer) in which any Person (or the shareholders of
any Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer,
if consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 30% or more of any
class of capital stock of the Company or (5) any combination of the foregoing.

 

(ii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Company
Takeover Proposal ( _provided_  that for purposes of this definition, the
applicable percentage in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be
"50.1%" rather than "30% or more"), which the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor,
and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Company Takeover Proposal and such other factors that are deemed relevant
by the Company Board, is more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into
account any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement that are
committed to in writing by Parent (including pursuant to  _Section
5.03(c)_).

(iii) " _Company Intervening Event_ " means any fact, circumstance,
effect, change, event or development that (1) is unknown to or by the Company
Board as of the date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material
consequences of which were not known or understood by the Company Board as of
the date of this Agreement) and (2) becomes known to or by the Company Board
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval.

SECTION 5.04  _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
consummate the Financing, or any Substitute Financing, as promptly as possible
following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, no later than the
Closing Date), including (i) (1) maintaining in effect the Debt Letters and
complying with all of their respective obligations thereunder and (2)
negotiating, entering into and delivering definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing reflecting the terms contained in the Debt Letters (or with
other terms agreed by Parent and the Financing Parties, subject to the
restrictions on amendments of the Debt Letters set forth below), so that such
agreements are in effect no later than the Closing, and (ii) satisfying on a
timely basis all the conditions to the Financing and the definitive
agreements related thereto that are applicable to Parent and its Affiliates.

 



33 (b) In the event that all conditions set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.03_
have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived,
Parent and its Affiliates shall cause the Persons providing the Financing (the
" _Financing Parties_ ") to fund on the Closing Date the Financing, to the
extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall enforce its rights under the
Debt Letters (including in the event of any breach or purported breach thereof
and including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and the
other Financing Parties to fund such Financing). Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt Letters or in any
definitive agreement related to the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, object to the utilization of any "market flex"
provisions by any Financing Party.

(c) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current and timely
basis of the status of Parents efforts to obtain the Financing and to
satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising and updating the Company,
in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date
and material terms of the definitive documentation related to the Financing,
providing copies of then current drafts of the credit agreement and other
primary definitive documents and giving the Company prompt notice of any
material change (adverse or otherwise) with respect to the Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day) if at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 

(i) any Debt Letter expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person
attempts or purports to terminate or repudiate any Debt Letter, whether or
not such attempted or purported termination or repudiation is valid);

(ii) Parent obtains knowledge of any breach or default or any threatened
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without due
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Debt Letter or any definitive
document related to the Financing of any provisions of the Debt Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing;

 

(iii) Parent receives any communication (written or oral) from any Person with
respect to any (1) actual, potential or threatened breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Letters or any definitive
document related to the Financing of any provisions of the Debt Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing or (2) dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Letters;

(iv) any Financing Party refuses to provide or expresses (orally or in
writing) an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Letters on the terms set forth therein (or expresses
(orally or in writing) that such Person does not intend to enter into all or
any portion of definitive documentation related to the Financing or to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby); or

 

(v) there occurs any event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent to obtain all, or any portion of, the
Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt Letters or the
definitive documents related to the Financing or if at any time for any other
reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by any of the Debt Letters or the definitive
documents related to the Financing.

 



34 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in _Section 5.04(c)(i)(v)_
of the immediately preceding sentence.

(e) Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under
the Debt Letters (including to add lenders, arrangers, agents, bookrunners,
managers and other financing sources) without the prior written approval of
the Company; _provided_ that Parent shall not, without Companys prior written
consent, permit any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or
waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy
under the Debt Letters which would (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount), (2) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the
Financing or (3) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of
the Debt Letters in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be
expected to (A) delay or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (B)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or (C) adversely affect the ability of Parent
to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. In the event that new debt or equity commitment letters or fee letters
are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this _Section
5.04(e)_, such new commitment letters or fee letters shall be deemed to be a
part of the "Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes
of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt
Letters.

 

(f) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion
thereof, become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (i) notify
the Company in writing thereof, (ii) obtain substitute financing sufficient to
enable Parent to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms (the "
_Substitute Financing_ ") and (iii) obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new
commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably
satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing removing only
the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market
flex") and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Substitute
Financing 

 



35  shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount), (2) impose new or additional
conditions to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of
the conditions to the Financing or (3) otherwise expand, amend, modify or
waive any provision of the Debt Letters in a manner that in any such case
would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely the funding of
the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the
Closing Date, (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (C) adversely affect the
ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Letters.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither Parents
nor Merger Subs obligations hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon
Parent or Merger Sub obtaining the Financing, any Substitute Financing or any
other financing.

SECTION 5.05 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_), subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Section 5.05_, and unless otherwise agreed by Parent, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent as reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with Parents arrangement of the Financing
(which, solely for purposes of this Section 5.05, shall include any
alternative equity or debt capital markets financings contemplated by the Debt
Letters). Such cooperation will include using reasonable best efforts to:

(i) make appropriate officers reasonably available, with appropriate advance
notice, for participation in bank meetings, due diligence sessions, meetings
with ratings agencies and road shows, reasonable assistance in the preparation
of confidential information memoranda, private placement memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or any Financing Party, in each case, with respect to information relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with customary marketing
efforts of Parent for all or any portion of the Financing;

 

(ii) furnish Parent and the Financing Parties with copies of such financial
data with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries which is prepared by
the Company in the ordinary course of business as is reasonably requested by
Parent or any Financing Party and is customarily required for the arrangement
and syndication of financings similar to the Financing committed pursuant to
the Debt Letters; and

(iii) request that the Companys independent accountants participate
in drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions and cooperate with
the Financing (including as set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect on the
date of this Agreement) or in connection with a customary offering of
securities, including the type described in the Commitment Letters,
consistent with their customary practice, including requesting that they
provide customary consents and comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort) to the extent required in connection with the marketing and
syndication of Financing (including as set forth in the Debt Letters as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) or as are customarily required in an
underwritten offering of securities of the type described in the
Debt Letters;

 



36 _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company to cause the delivery of (1) legal opinions or reliance letters or
any certificate as to solvency or any other certificate necessary for the
Financing, other than as allowed by _Section 5.05(a)(iii)_, (2) any audited
financial information or any financial information prepared in accordance
with Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or any financial information in a form not customarily prepared by
the Company with respect to such period or (3) any financial information with
respect to a month or fiscal period that has not yet ended or has ended less
than forty-five 45 days prior to the date of such request.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.05_): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including
this _Section 5.05_) shall require any such cooperation to the extent that it
would (1) require the Company to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse
any expenses or otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities prior
to the Closing, (2) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or
operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (3) require the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any agreement or

Organization Documents and any indemnification or other similar Contracts of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date

their terms (it being agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be
mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their respective
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the

and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving
at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer
or employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Claim, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and

pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was
a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer or employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. In the event of any such Claim, (i) each Company
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such Claim from Parent within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt by Parent from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law or the
Surviving Corporations Organizational Documents, to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not
entitled to indemnification and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such matter.

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the covenants and
agreements set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the

current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that

 



45  occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at
least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation
is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.09(c)_ it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six
(6) year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect
of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to
the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance
policy for the Company and its current and former directors, officers and
employees who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage
and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time for a
period of not less than six (6) years; _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the
Maximum Amount. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.09_.

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the two
(2) year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
individual who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") who is not covered by a Company Union Contract and who remains a
Company Employee with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than that provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the

Continuation Period, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, provide each Company Employee who

 



46  experiences a termination of employment with the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their Subsidiaries severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those set forth in  _Section 6.10(a)(1)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. During the three-year period following the Continuation
Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat
Company Employees with respect to the payment of base salary or wage rate,
incentive compensation opportunities, employee benefits and severance benefits
no less favorably in the aggregate than similarly situated employees of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries. Prior to the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to not,
terminate or amend in any manner that is materially adverse to the
participants therein, any of the Company Benefit Plans listed on _Section
6.10(a)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. During the three-year period
following the third anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to Section
6.10(d)(ii), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat
retirees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the provision of
post-retirement welfare benefits no less favorably than similarly situated
retirees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Except as provided on _Section
6.10(a)(3)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, as soon as practicable
following the end of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each Company
Employee who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of their Subsidiaries through the applicable payment date an annual cash bonus
for such fiscal year in an amount determined based on the level of attainment
of the applicable performance criteria under the bonus plan in which such
Company Employee participated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee who is covered by a Company Union
Contract, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue
to honor the Company Union Contracts, in each case as in effect at the
Effective Time, in accordance with their terms (it being understood that
this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such Company Union Contract,
to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Company Union Contract
and applicable Law). The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall be subject
to any applicable provisions of the Company Union Contracts and applicable Law
in respect of such Company Employee, to the extent the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the
provisions of any such Company Union Contract or applicable Law.

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the
Companys and all of the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance,
retention, termination and change-in-control plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change-in-control severance
agreement or other arrangement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Merger (either alone or in combination
with any other event), it being understood that this sentence shall not
be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
amend or terminate any such plans, policies, programs, agreements, or
arrangements, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement. For purposes of any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement containing a definition of "change
in control," "change of control" or similar term that relates to a transaction
at the level of the Company, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control," "change of control" or such similar term.

 



47 (d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), each Company Employees service with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service
with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company
Subsidiary and is accurately reflected within a Company Employees records)
shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, except (i) to
the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) for
purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit
plan, any grandfathered or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (iii) to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no provision of this _Section 6.10_ is intended to, or shall, constitute
the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan
for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no Company Personnel or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment). Nothing contained herein shall alter the at-will
employment relationship of any Company Employee.

SECTION 6.11  _Merger Sub_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity
of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of the
Merger.

(b) Parent hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment
performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and compliance by Merger Sub
with, all of the covenants and agreements of Merger Sub under this Agreement
and (ii) agrees to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to ensure
such payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub hereunder.

 



48 SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, the Company
and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably appropriate to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

liabilities described in the preceding sentence shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Termination Fees_.

 

(i) If (1) (A) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant

conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ or, in connection with the Required

either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(b)(ii)_ (if, and only if, the applicable Legal Restraint giving rise to
such termination arises in connection with the Required Statutory Approvals)
or (C) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(ii)_ based on a failure by Parent to perform its covenants or
agreements under _Section 6.03_, and in each case of the foregoing clauses

the Closing set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_, _Section 7.03(a)_, _Section
7.03(b)_ and _Section 7.03(c)_ shall have been satisfied or waived (except
for (I) those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing but which conditions would be satisfied or would be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination or (II) those
conditions that have not been satisfied as a result of a breach of this
Agreement by Parent), or (2) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c)(iii)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of
$326,900,000 in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Parent shall pay the

to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_.

(iii) If (1) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_, (2) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, a
Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and, as of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, such Company Takeover Proposal shall not have
been withdrawn and (3) within nine (9) months after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not the
same Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (2)), then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in
writing by Parent) within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of the date
the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such Company
Takeover Proposal. For purposes of clause (3) of this _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_,
the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in _Section 5.01_, except that the applicable percentage in the
definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be "50.1%" rather than "30% or
more".

 



53 (c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section
8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. If Parent fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.02(b)(i)_, or the Company fails to promptly pay an amount due
pursuant to _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a Claim that results in a Judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in _Section 8.02(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, or
any portion thereof, or a Judgment against Parent for the amount set forth
in  _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to
Parent, on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other
hand, its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the
fees and expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by the Company) in
connection with such Claim, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Any amount payable pursuant to _Section
8.02(b)_ shall be paid by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same-day
funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made under
_Section 8.02(b)_.

(d) Without limiting any rights of the Company under  _Section 9.10_ prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Parent is obligated to
pay the Parent Termination Fee under  _Section 8.02(b)(i)_, upon payment of
the Parent Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, Parent shall
have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock,
and payment of the Parent Termination Fee and such costs and expenses by
Parent shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, suffered or
incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other Person in
connection with this

 



54  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and the Company
shall not have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right,
remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at
law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity), including against
any Financing Source Party; _provided_ that, regardless of whether Parent
pays or is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, nothing in this
_Section 8.02(d)_ shall release Parent from liability for a Willful Breach of
this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which
the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under _Section
8.02(b)(ii) _or _Section 8.02(b)(iii)_, upon payment of the Company
Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of Parent pursuant
to  _Section 8.02(c)_ in accordance herewith, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, and payment of the Company Termination Fee and
such costs and expenses by the Company shall be Parents sole and exclusive
remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have, and each expressly
waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity). The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company or Parent, as applicable, be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more
than one occasion. 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means a breach that
is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching Party with
the Knowledge that the taking of or the omission of taking such act would, or
would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of this
Agreement; _provided_ that, without limiting the meaning of Willful Breach,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by any Party to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the
time of such failure to consummate the Merger) shall constitute a
Willful Breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that all applicable conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have
been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the Merger) but Parent
fails to close for any reason, including for failure to have the necessary
financing to close, such failure to close shall be considered a Willful
Breach. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, without in any way
limiting the Companys rights under _Section 9.10_, recoverable damages of
the Company hereunder shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs but shall also include the benefit of the bargain lost by
the shareholders of the Company (including "lost premium"), taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to the
Companys shareholders under this Agreement and the time value of money,
which, in each case, shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the
Company and shall be recoverable by the Company on behalf of its shareholders.

 



55 SECTION 8.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such
shareholders, (b) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time, (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall require the approval of the shareholders of Parent or the shareholders
of the Company and (d) no amendments to or waivers of any DFS Provision shall
be effective without the written consent of the Financing Source Parties. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

SECTION 8.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to _Section
8.03(a)_, waive compliance with any covenants and agreements contained herein
or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

SECTION 8.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_.
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.03_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 8.04_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its respective board of directors
or the duly authorized designee of its board of directors. Termination of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of
the shareholders of the Company. The Party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Parties in accordance with _Section 9.02_,
specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination
is effected.

Except (a) for the right of the Company on behalf of its shareholders to
pursue damages (including claims for damages contemplated by the last sentence

covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement
and (ii) this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
Financing Parties and each of their respective Affiliates and their respective
current, former and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees or representatives (collectively, the " _Financing
Source Parties_ ") shall be express third-party beneficiaries with respect to
_Section 8.02(d)_, _Section 8.03_, this _Section 9.07_, _Section 9.08_,
_Section 9.11(b)_, _Section 9.12 _and _Section 9.14_ (collectively, the "
_DFS Provisions_ ").

SECTION 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of
action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or
whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may
be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard
to principles of conflict of laws, except as otherwise set forth in the Debt
Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, all matters relating
to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

SECTION 9.09  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void; _provided_ that Parent may make as assignment of
its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any Financing
Party without the prior written consent of the Company. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

SECTION 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any
time prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to
cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in any court referred to in _Section_

 



60   _9.11_ , without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party brings any
Claim to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the period of time
between the commencement of such Claim and the date on which such Claim is
fully and finally resolved.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement shall
be raised to and exclusively determined by the courts of the State of Florida
located in Hillsborough County or, if such court disclaims jurisdiction, the
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, to
whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally consent and
submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement in
such court and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agree
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to the respective addresses set forth in  _Section 9.02_ hereof shall
be effective service of process for any Claim brought against such Party in
any such court.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this _Section 9.11_), each Party agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom).

SECTION 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE
PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT
THERETO). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE

 



61  OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Construction_. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.14 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except for claims by Parent or the Merger Sub
against the Financing Source Parties pursuant to the Debt Letters and any
definitive documents related thereto, (a) none of the Parties nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source Party, in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith
or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b)
no Financing Source Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise) to any Party or any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
Party under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
