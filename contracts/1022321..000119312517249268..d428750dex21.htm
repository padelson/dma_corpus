(b) During the forty-five (45)-day period immediately following Sellers
receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), Seller and its representatives will be permitted to review

Closing Adjustment Statement. As reasonably requested by Seller, Purchaser
will, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
accountants to, cooperate with and assist Seller and its representatives
in the conduct of such review, including by providing reasonable access to
such books and records and work papers and making available personnel to the

and, if required by the accountants, subject to signing a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the accountants.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final and binding, it will
not take or permit to be taken, any actions with respect to any accounting
books, records, policies or procedures on which the Financial Statements or
the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is based, or on 

 



-18-  which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is to be based, that are
inconsistent with the Transaction Accounting Principles or that would
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the determination of the
amount of the Initial Closing Working Capital, the Initial Closing Adjustment
Amount or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods provided
by this Agreement.

2.6 _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

 

(a) Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of the
Review Period if Seller believes the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement contains errors or was not prepared in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.5(a)_, which notice shall describe the basis for such belief in
reasonable detail (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If no Notice of
Disagreement is received by Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, then the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Seller and shall become final and binding upon the
Parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_, absent manifest error or
fraud.

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement (if any) (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. All
such discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule and evidence of such
discussions shall not be admissible or used by any Party in any future
proceedings between the Parties, including any proceedings before or with the
Independent Accounting Firm.

(c) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement (other than disputes involving
the application or interpretation of applicable Law or other provisions of
this Agreement), Seller and Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the
Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement marked to indicate those line items
that are not in dispute, which line items shall be deemed final and binding on
the Parties) to an independent certified public accounting firm in the United
States of good national reputation mutually acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Within thirty (30) days
after the __ Independent Accounting Firms selection, the Independent
Accounting Firm (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) shall make a
final, written determination, binding on the Parties, of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement which remain in dispute, as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement
which Seller and Purchaser have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall calculate, based solely on (x) a single
set of written submissions of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, made within fifteen (15) days after the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm and shared with the other Party, and (y) a single
written response submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm within five (5)
days after receipt of each such submission (which the Independent Accounting
Firm shall share with the other Party), and not by independent investigation,
the Initial Closing Adjustment Amount. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller and their respective accountants will
each make available to the

 



-19-  Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel, and such
information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably required
by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of
Seller or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to
the Independent Accounting Firm, except in accordance with such accountants
normal disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has signed a
customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be made in
accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles and the other
definitions and applicable provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) with respect
to each item in dispute, such determination shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller in the
Notice of Disagreement or by Purchaser in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement with respect to such disputed line item. The statement of the
Initial Closing Adjustment Amount as determined either through agreement of
the Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ or through the
action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.6(c)_ shall be final and binding on the Parties and is referred to as the "
_Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ " and the Initial Closing Adjustment
Amount set forth therein as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, in proportion to the differences between the
Initial Closing Adjustment Amount as determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm and the Initial Closing Adjustment Amount set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement and the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, respectively.

 

2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be
equal to (a) the Final Adjustment Amount  _less_ (b) the Closing Adjustment.
If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay
in cash to Seller (or one or more Affiliates of Seller designated by Seller)
the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by Seller prior to the
Closing. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller
shall (or shall cause an Affiliate designated by Seller to) pay in cash
to Purchaser the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Purchaser prior to the Closing. Any such payment shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement is delivered. The Purchase Price shall equal the Pre-Adjustment
Amount (x) _ plus_ the Final Adjustment Amount, if the Final Adjustment
Amount is positive, or (y) _ less_ the absolute value of the Final Adjustment
Amount, if the Final Adjustment Amount is negative.

 

2.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser and the members of the Alkali Group shall be entitled to withhold
and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Purchaser or the members of the Alkali Group are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law; _provided_ , that Purchaser
shall provide Seller with reasonable notice prior to withholding any amounts
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ and the parties shall cooperate to
minimize or eliminate any withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

3.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company has all necessary

Governmental Entity is required on the part of the Alkali Group for the

5.4 _Financing_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ are true, complete and correct
copies of (i) the Class A Convertible Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, by
and among Purchaser, Rodeo Finance Aggregator LLC and GSO Rodeo Holdings LP
(the " _Investors_ "), dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Investors have agreed to
provide equity financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") to Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Securities Purchase Agreement_ "), and (ii) an executed commitment letter
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and corresponding customarily redacted fee
letters (none of which redacted terms affect the amount or availability of the
Debt Financing or imposed any conditions on the receipt of the Debt
Financing) (the " _Fee Letter_ ") from the financial institutions identified
therein (the " _Lenders_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing Commitments_ ," as each may be amended or replaced from time to time
to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ and, together with the
Securities Purchase Agreement, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being
collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). Each of the Financing
Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, and to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, each
of the Financing Commitments is in full force and effect, and none of the
Financing Commitments has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or
modification is contemplated. Purchaser is not in breach of any of the terms
or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments, and as of the
date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or
failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date
hereof, Purchaser (i) has no reason to believe that any event has occurred
that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a
breach or default under any of the Financing Commitments, (ii) is not aware of
any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Purchaser in any of the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any
material respect and (iii) has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments will not be made available on the Closing Date. The
Investors have not, and as of the date, no Financing Source 

 



-41-  has notified Purchaser of their intention to terminate all or any portion of
the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing. The net cash
proceeds from the Financing (including any Alternative Financing), together
with available cash on hand, will be sufficient to satisfy all of Purchasers
obligations hereunder, including the payment of the Purchase Price and any
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser has paid in full any
and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments
that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof,
all such fees as they become due. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies to the obligations of the parties under the Financing
Commitments (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the related fee
letter or otherwise) to make the full amount of the Financing available to
Purchaser on the terms therein except as expressly set forth in the unredacted
portion of the Financing Commitments. There are no side letters or other
agreements, understandings, contracts or arrangements (written, oral or
otherwise) related to the Financing (other than the Financing Commitments).
There are no conditions precedent, contingencies or requirements to such
funding other than any of the conditions expressly set forth in
the unredacted portions of the Financing Commitments nor any reduction to the
aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date
(nor any term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the
aggregate amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing
Date). Subject to the Companys compliance with this Agreement and the
satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_
and  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions), as of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, or that the Financing will not be
available on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a
condition to Closing under this Agreement for Purchaser to obtain the
Financing or any Alternative Financing.

5.5 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no Action
pending, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder
or delay any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) neither
Purchaser nor any Subsidiary thereof is subject to any outstanding Order, writ
or injunction that would reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder or delay
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.6 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller would be
responsible based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

 

5.7 _Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Purchaser has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as is required for evaluating
the merits and risks of its purchase of the Shares and is capable of such
evaluation. Purchaser confirms that Seller has made available (or caused to be
made available) to Purchaser and Purchasers agents and representatives
the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management and employees
of the Alkali Group as well as access to the documents, information and
records of the Alkali Group and to acquire additional information about the
business and financial condition of the Alkali Group, and Purchaser confirms
that it has made an independent investigation, analysis and

 



-42-  evaluation of the Alkali Group and their properties, assets, business,
financial condition, prospects, documents, information and records. Purchaser
is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view toward or for sale
in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Shares. Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign
securities Laws, and agrees that the Shares may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration available under the Securities Act, and without compliance
with foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.

PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SHARES AND THE BUSINESSES AND PROPERTIES OF

IV_ (OR AS REFLECTED IN ANY SCHEDULES OR CERTIFICATES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT) OR IN ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT
ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND IN PARTICULAR, WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR
REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF
THE ASSETS OR PROPERTIES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ALKALI GROUP.

5.9 _No Regulatory Impediment_. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is no
fact relating to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates respective businesses,
operations, financial condition or legal status, including any officers,
directors or current employees status, that would reasonably be expected to
impair the ability of the Parties to this Agreement to obtain, on a timely
basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval of, or
ability to contract with, any U.S. Governmental Entity necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.10 _ERISA_. Purchaser is not an "employee benefit plan" as defined in
ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, or a "plan" as defined in Section 4975
of the Code, and none of Purchasers assets constitutes (or is deemed to
constitute for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or any
substantially similar federal, state or municipal Law) "plan assets" for
purposes of 29 CFR Section 2510.3-101, as amended by Section 3(42) of ERISA,
or otherwise for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

5.11 _Solvency_. Purchaser is not entering into the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Purchaser is Solvent as of the date of this Agreement and, assuming the
satisfaction of the condition to Sellers and the Companys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser, the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (on both a stand-alone and on a combined
basis) will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the payment of the Purchase Price and all other
amounts required to be paid, borrowed or refinanced in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
related fees and expenses, be Solvent at and after the Closing Date.

form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to the other parties to
confidentiality agreements with respect to the sale of the Shares (or other
similar transactions) authorizing Purchaser to recover all information (as
defined in such agreements or undertakings) or requesting certification of
its destruction to Purchaser in each case in accordance with the terms of such
agreements and undertakings; _provided_ that Seller shall not be required to
send any letter to any such party that has previously sent Seller a
certification (including, e-mails) that such party has returned or destroyed
such information.

in advance any submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted
therewith) intended to be given by it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other

Seller, as each deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance in writing from the source of the materials
(Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ , each of Purchaser and Seller

of the businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser and/or the members of
the Alkali Group, and (z) agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of, hold

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall and shall cause the members of
the Alkali Group to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each
member of the Seller Group and their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, "
_Seller Guarantors_ ") against any and all Losses that any Seller Guarantor
suffers, incurs or is liable for by reason of or arising out of or in
consequence of any Seller Guarantor being an issuer with respect to, making
payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a
party to, any guarantee, indemnity,

 



-53-  surety bond, letter of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer
financing arrangements, or other similar commitment, understanding, agreement
or obligation arising from any member of the Alkali Group and listed on
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which list may be
supplemented by Seller after the date hereof and at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date to include any such guarantee, indemnity,
surety bond, letter of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer
financing arrangements, or other similar commitment, understanding, agreement
or obligation primarily relating any member of the Alkali Group after the
date hereof in the ordinary course of business) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Guarantees_ "); (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on any
Seller Guarantor with respect to any of the Indemnified Guarantees; or (iii)
any Action, claim or proceeding by any Person who is or claims to be entitled
to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or
indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantees.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(including renegotiating the material terms of the Indemnified Guarantees) to
cause itself or the members of the Alkali Group to be substituted in all
respects for each applicable member of the Seller Group, and for each such
member of the Seller Group to be released, effective as of the Closing or (if
such substitution and release cannot be effected as of the Closing) as soon
as possible after the Closing, in respect of all obligations of each such
member of the Seller Group under each of the Indemnified Guarantees. For any
Indemnified Guarantees for which Purchaser or the members of the Alkali
Group, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects for each applicable
member of the Seller Group (or for which each such member of the Seller Group
is not released) effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause the members of the Alkali
Group to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution and
release as promptly as practicable after the Closing, and Seller shall
continue to reasonably cooperate in Purchasers efforts. Purchaser further
agrees that, to the extent the beneficiary or counterparty under any
Indemnified Guarantee does not accept any such substitute arrangement
proffered by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or to the extent each
member of the Seller Group is not fully and irrevocably released and
discharged, Purchaser shall reimburse each member of the Seller Group for, any
and all amounts paid, including costs or expenses in connection with such
Indemnified Guarantee, including expenses in maintaining such Indemnified
Guarantee, whether or not any such Indemnified Guarantee is drawn upon or
required to be performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse
each member of the Seller Group to the extent any Indemnified Guarantee is
called upon and any member of the Seller Group makes any payment or is
obligated to reimburse the Party issuing such Indemnified Guarantee.

the State of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality
Division (the " _Wyoming DEQ_ "), including the requirement that mining
operations in Wyoming be covered by a reclamation bond if the operator of such
mine is unable to fulfill the reclamation requirements (the " _Reclamation
Requirements_ "). Pursuant to the Reclamation Requirements, the Alkali Group

Bond Issuer_ "), Bond No. 8245-05-17 for the principal bond amount of
$26,880,000.00, Bond No. 8245-05-18 for the principal bond amount of
$51,814,000.00, and Bond No. 8245-05-19 for the principal bond amount of
$878,400.00, in each case, in favor of the Wyoming DEQ, as beneficiary
(collectively, the " _Surety Bonds_ "), in connection with which each of
Seller and

 



-54-  Tronox Alkali Wyoming Corporation has executed a General Agreement of
Indemnity in favor of the Surety Bond Issuer and Westchester Fire Insurance
Company (the " _Indemnity Agreement_ "). Purchaser acknowledges that,
effective as of the Closing, the Indemnity Agreement shall be terminated, and,
without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause the Wyoming DEQ to accept,
effective as of the Closing, such form of assurance or collateral (whether it
be by self-bonding, entering in an agreement substantially similar to the
Indemnity Agreement vis a vis the Surety Bonds or otherwise) as may be
reasonably requested by the Wyoming DEQ in order to comply with the
Reclamation Requirements, (ii) deliver to Seller at Closing releases of its
current obligations (including guaranties of self-bonding obligations and any
of its obligations under the Surety Bonds or the Indemnity Agreement) under
the Reclamation Requirements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Seller. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with
any such release under the Reclamation Requirements.

(d) To the extent, if any, that any member of the Seller Group directly
or indirectly retains, remains liable for, or has any credit exposure with
respect to, any material obligation of any member of the Alkali Group,
Purchaser shall, (i) upon Sellers request, promptly and as soon as available
furnish to Seller such annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements of
Purchaser and members of the Alkali Group, including consolidated balance
sheets, statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity, for the
applicable period, all in reasonable detail, and any other financial
information or assurances as Seller may from time to time reasonably request,
(ii) permit Seller to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any material term of any contract or agreement related to any Indemnified
Guarantee for so long as any member of the Seller Group retains or remains
directly or indirectly liable for, or has any credit exposure with respect to,
such Indemnified Guarantee and (iii) during the period beginning ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date and ending on the date on which Seller no longer
directly or indirectly retains, remains liable for or has any credit exposure
with respect to any Indemnified Guarantee, pay Seller, on a monthly basis
(promptly following the end of each month), the Interest Rate on the
aggregate outstanding amount of the Indemnified Guarantees that Seller
directly or indirectly retains, remains liable for or has any credit exposure
with respect to.

 

6.8 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date, the members of the Alkali
Group shall cease to be insured by the insurance policies held by Seller or
any member of the Seller Group, or by any of their self-insured programs, and
neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
members of the Alkali Group) shall have any access, right, title or interest
to or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and rights to
make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any assets of the members of
the Alkali Group. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates
may, to be effective as of the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the
manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. From
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the Alkali Group.
Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise
any rights or claims of any member of the Alkali Group under or in respect of
any past or current insurance policy of Seller under which any member of the
Alkali Group or Affiliate thereof is an additional insured.

 



-55- 6.9 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, is prosecuting, contesting or defending any legal proceeding,
Action, investigation, charge, claim, or demand by a third party in connection
with (a) any transactions contemplated under this Agreement, or (b) any
fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating
to, in connection with the members of the Alkali Group, the other Party shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including with respect to
the Purchaser after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group) and its and
their respective directors, officers and employees to, reasonably cooperate
with such first Party and its counsel in such prosecution, contest or
defenses, including making reasonably available its personnel, and providing
such testimony and reasonable access to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense,
in each case, during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice and in
accordance with reasonable procedures established by the Party providing such
access.

 

6.10 _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Restricted Parties not to, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for
employment (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) any officer, or
other senior employee or substantially full-time consultant (with an annual
salary exceeding $150,000) of any member of the Alkali Group immediately prior
to the Closing; _provided_ that the Restricted Parties shall not be precluded
from soliciting or hiring any such employee or substantially full-time
consultant who (i) has been terminated by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group) at least six
(6) months prior to the solicitation not otherwise permitted hereunder or (ii)
responds to a general or public solicitation (including by a _bona fide_
search firm) not targeted at employees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Restricted Parties shall not be restricted from engaging in
general or public solicitations or advertising not targeted at any such
employee of any member of the Purchaser Group.

(b) For a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of
the Alkali Group, not to), directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for
employment (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) any officer, or
other member of management, who was an employee (with an annual salary
exceeding $150,000) of any member of the Seller Group immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be precluded
from soliciting or hiring any such employee who (i) has been terminated by
any member of the Seller Group at least six (6) months prior to the
solicitation not otherwise permitted hereunder or (ii) responds to a general
or public solicitation (including by a _bona_ _fide_ search firm) not
targeted at employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be restricted
from engaging in general or public solicitations or advertising not targeted
at any such employee of any member of the Seller Group.

 



-56- (c) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
the Restricted Parties not to engage in a Restricted Business anywhere in the
world. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following shall be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_: (i) the purchase or ownership by a Restricted
Party of a Person or business that derives less than the greater of (A) ten
percent (10%) of its total annual revenues and (B) $15,000,000 in annual
revenues from the Restricted Business, measured for the fiscal year
ended immediately prior to the date of such purchase, (ii) the purchase or
ownership by a Restricted Party of a Person or business that derives an amount
equal to or greater than the greater of (x) ten percent (10%) or more of its
total annual revenues and (y) $15,000,000 in annual revenues from the
Restricted Business measured for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to
the date of such purchase, as long as that Restricted Party shall commit to,
and shall, divest to an unaffiliated third party all of the Restricted
Business operated by such acquired or owned Person or business or reduce the
Restricted Business operated by such acquired or owned Person or business in
size to constitute less than $15,000,000 in annual revenues as soon as
reasonably practicable, in each case and in any event not later than six (6)
months following the acquisition of such ownership or interest ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such six (6)-month period shall be extended to the date on
which all approvals from a Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Law
required to complete the divestiture are received (but no later than the first
(1st) anniversary following the acquisition of such Person or business) if
such approvals are not received by the six (6)-month anniversary following
the acquisition of such Person or business), (iii) the direct or indirect
ownership for passive investment purposes by Restricted Parties of publicly
traded interests in or securities of any Person engaged in the Restricted
Business to the extent that such investment does not, directly or indirectly,
confer on the Restricted Parties more than four and nine-tenths percent (4.9%)
of the total voting power of such Person and (iv) the investment in any fund
in which no Restricted Party have any discretion with respect to the
investment strategy or selection of such fund.

 

(d) Each Restricted Party agrees that the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, including the term and geographic area encompassed
herein, are necessary and reasonable to protect the legitimate business
interests of the Purchaser and the Alkali Group in the conduct of the Business
and their business (including the goodwill purchased pursuant to
this Agreement); are reasonably drawn to this end; are not unduly burdensome;
are not injurious to the public interest; and are supported by adequate
consideration. Each Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement absent
the agreement by the Restricted Parties to abide by the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 12.10_, which shall
remain in effect and apply while any obligations of this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ remain in effect, Purchaser and each Restricted Party agree that if
Seller or any member of the Seller Group, or Purchaser or any member of the
Alkali Group, respectively, institutes any action or proceeding to enforce
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, the party instituting such
action or proceeding shall (in addition to any other legal relief available)
be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief to enforce the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, and such relief may be granted
without the necessity of proving actual damages. Seller and the Seller Group,
or Purchaser and the Alkali Group, as applicable, shall be entitled to seek
recovery from Purchaser or each Restricted Party, respectively, the reasonable
attorneys fees incurred in enforcing the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.10_. Any claim that any Restricted Party may have against Purchaser or any
member of the Alkali Group, or any claim that Purchaser may have against
Seller or any member of the Seller, whether under this Agreement or otherwise,
will have no impact on or constitute a defense to enforcement of
the obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 



-57- (f) To the extent that any provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall
be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalid or unenforceable
portion of such provisions shall be deleted from this Agreement, and the
validity and enforceability of the remainder of such provisions and of this
Agreement shall be unaffected. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, it is expressly agreed that should the duration of or geographic
extent of, or business activities covered by, the provisions contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ be determined to be invalid or unenforceable
under applicable Law, then such provision shall be construed or modified to
cover only that duration or extent or those activities that may validly be
covered. Each Restricted Party expressly stipulates that this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ shall be construed in a manner that renders its provisions valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible
under applicable Law. The restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any non-competition, non-
solicitation, non-disparagement, protection of confidential information, or
other restrictive covenants by which any Restricted Party may be bound,
including any non-solicitation obligation implied by law. Each Restricted
Party agrees that each member of the Alkali Group is a beneficiary of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and may enforce the
obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

(g) The Restricted Parties agree and intend that the obligations contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, as to all Restricted Parties, be tolled during
any period that any Restricted Party is in breach of any of the obligations in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, so that Purchaser and each member of the Alkali
Group are provided with the full benefit of the restrictive periods set forth
herein.

6.11 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification under the Alkali
Groups officers and directors liability insurance for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, managers or officers of any member of the Alkali Group
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") as provided in the Organizational
Documents of the applicable member of the Alkali Group or the indemnity or
indemnification agreements or as provided pursuant to a resolution of the
board of directors (or similar governing body) of such member of the Alkali
Group shall survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for a period of not less
than six (6) years from the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit
any member of the Alkali Group to, amend, modify or terminate any
Organizational Document, or such Contract or resolution regarding or related
to such indemnification matters, unless such documents or the relevant
provisions thereof are replaced with provisions that are no less favorable to
the Covered Persons. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall obtain
for the Company, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, shall maintain (or shall
obtain a six (6)-year "tail" policy providing for) liability insurance
covering the Covered Persons with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing Date, with such policies providing aggregate annual coverage of at
least $75 million and containing terms and 

 



-58-  conditions that are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the Covered
Persons than the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policies covering the Covered Persons (including coverage under any
policy of the applicable member of the Seller Group (as a result of such
Covered Persons former service to such member of the Alkali Group));
_provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 250%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (or,
in the case of a "tail" policy, 400% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance). If such "tail" policy has been obtained by
Purchaser for the Company prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Company, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
hereunder.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause each member of the Alkali Group to, honor all obligations of such
member of the Alkali Group to indemnify (including any obligations to advance
funds for expenses to, _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced undertakes to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to such indemnification) the
Covered Persons for acts or omissions by such Covered Persons occurring prior
to the Closing to the extent that such obligations of such member of the
Alkali Group exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to
Organizational Documents, or the indemnity or indemnification agreements,
board (or similar governing body) resolution or otherwise, and such
obligations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of the Organizational Documents of such
member of the Alkali Group or such board (or similar governing body)
resolutions or indemnity or indemnification agreements from the Closing until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims against such Covered Persons arising out of such acts or omissions.

(c) From and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each member of the Alkali Group to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Covered Persons against all damages,
losses, charges, liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments,
settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) (" _Covered Losses_ "), as incurred (payable monthly upon
written request, which request shall include reasonable evidence of the
Covered Losses set forth therein), to the extent arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, any actual or threatened Action in respect of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing in connection with such
Covered Persons duties as an officer, director or manager (or persons holding
similar positions) of such member of the Alkali Group or any member of the
Seller Group (as a result of such Covered Persons former service to such
member of the Seller Group in respect of the Business), excluding any Covered
Losses of the Seller Group; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced undertakes to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to such indemnification.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if any
Covered Person is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by any Person
(including any member of the Seller Group) other than Purchaser or a member of
the Alkali Group, such Covered Person shall not be required to recover from or
be indemnified by, or to seek such recovery or indemnification from,

 



-59-  any such other Person prior to or as a condition to being indemnified as
described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (Purchaser hereby acknowledging and
agreeing that indemnification as described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_,
including payments from the insurance proceeds under the insurance policy
required by _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, shall be the first recourse of the
Covered Persons for Covered Losses relating to the subject matter of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_) and (ii) in the event that any member of the Seller
Group is subject to any indemnification, reimbursement or similar liabilities
with respect to any Covered Person or otherwise incurs any Covered Losses
with respect to the subject matter of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (including
Covered Losses in respect of contribution), Purchaser shall indemnify each
such Person from, against and with respect to any Covered Losses arising out
of, resulting from or otherwise in respect of such Liabilities or Covered
Losses.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Covered Person, it being expressly agreed that
such Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
6.11_, and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract
or otherwise. If the Company (or Purchaser, if applicable) or its successors
or assigns (x) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (y) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company (or Purchaser, if
applicable) shall assume all of the obligations of the Company (or Purchaser,
if applicable) under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

6.12 _Shared Contracts_. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller is a party to
certain Contracts that relate both to the Business and one or more of Sellers
other businesses with the vendors listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (any such Contracts other than off-the-shelf
software licensed under shrink wrap or clickwrap agreements for an annual fee
of less than $250,000, each, a " _Shared Contract_ "). Prior to the Closing,
Seller will, at Purchasers request, use commercially reasonable efforts (at
Purchasers cost and expense) to cause a member of the Alkali Group to enter
into a new Contract with respect to each such Shared Contract (each, a "
_Replacement Contract_ ") on terms that have been approved in writing in
advance by Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). From the Closing Date, until the six (6) month
anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into any Replacement Contract not previously entered into prior to the
Closing. If Seller is unable to enter into any Replacement Contract prior to
the Closing, until the earlier of such time as such Replacement Contract is
entered into and six (6) months following the Closing Date, Seller will, at
Purchasers request, if practicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser (at Purchasers cost and expense) in any arrangement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to provide Purchaser
with services under such Shared Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, from
and after six (6) months following the Closing, Purchaser shall have no right
to receive any claims, rights or benefits under any Shared Contract.

 



-60- 6.13 _Tronox_ _Marks_. Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group), acknowledges and agrees
that Purchaser is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right,
title or interest in or to the Tronox Marks, and (a) neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group) shall have any rights in or to the Tronox Marks, (b) on the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall cause the members of the Alkali Group to cease any and
all use of the Tronox Marks (including in the respective corporate or other
legal names of the members of the Alkali Group), and (c) neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group) shall (i) use, register or seek to use or register in any jurisdiction
any of the Tronox Marks or (ii) contest the use, ownership, validity or
enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or to any
of the Tronox Marks (other than for the Permitted Railcar Use).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.13_, (x) the members of the Alkali Group may continue to use any Tronox
Marks to the extent such Tronox Marks appear on or are incorporated in the
corporate or other legal name of any member of the Alkali Group or in any
existing tangible materials or software acquired by Purchaser under this
Agreement in the same manner as used by the members of the Alkali Group prior
to the Closing Date for a period not to exceed nine (9) months following the
Closing Date and in any case solely as necessary to wind down the use of, and
transition away from, such Tronox Marks (the " _Phase-Out  Period_") and (y)
the members of the Alkali Group may continue to use the Permitted Railcar
Marks that currently appear on or are incorporated on railcars currently in
use, provided that no member of the Alkali Group shall seek to
use, incorporate, or otherwise cause the Permitted Railcar Marks to appear on
any railcars that do not currently bear or incorporate such Permitted Railcar
Marks as of the date hereof (the " _Permitted Railcar Use_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, during the Phase-Out Period, Purchaser shall not (and
shall cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the
Alkali Group, not to) print, copy or create any tangible materials (including
printed materials and electronic materials) bearing or incorporating the
Tronox Marks. At the end of such Phase-out Period, Purchaser shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali
Group, to) have used their best efforts to have re-labelled, destroyed or
exhausted all materials bearing or incorporating the Tronox Marks (other than
the Permitted Railcar Marks used in the Permitted Railcar Use), including
signage, advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory,
electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards, websites,
and other materials, and have made all filings with any office, agency or
body to effect the elimination of any use of the Tronox Marks (other than the
Permitted Railcar Marks used in the Permitted Railcar Use) (including in the
respective corporate or other legal names of the members of the Alkali Group),
so as to bring Purchaser and its Affiliates, including, after the Closing,
the members of the Alkali Group, into compliance with this _Section_ __ _
6.13_. Following the end of the Phase-out Period, if Seller or any of its
Affiliates discover any incident of usage of the Tronox Marks by Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group)
in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, promptly upon receipt of notice
from Seller, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group), as applicable, to promptly
destroy or re-label the relevant materials incorporating the Tronox Marks and
shall certify (pursuant to a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
Purchaser) the completion of such destruction or re-labelling. After the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group, not to) represent that it
has authority to bind Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



-61- 6.14 _Payments_.

 

(a) Seller shall promptly pay or deliver to Purchaser (or its designee) any
monies or checks which have been sent to Seller or any of its Affiliates
after the Closing by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the
members of the Alkali Group for goods or services provided by the members of
the Alkali Group.

 

(b) Seller agrees that Purchaser has the right and authority to endorse,
without recourse, any check or other evidence of indebtedness received by
Purchaser in respect of any accounts receivable, notes receivable and other
receivable arising from the operation of the Business and Seller shall furnish
Purchaser such evidence of this authority as Purchaser may request in
writing. 

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable member of the Alkali Group
to, promptly pay or deliver to Seller (or its designee) any monies or checks
that have been sent after the Closing to Purchaser, any member of the Alkali
Group or their respective Affiliates to the extent they are not due to the
members of the Alkali Group or should have otherwise been sent to Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller (including promptly forwarding invoices or similar
documentation to Seller).

(d) If, at any time after the Closing, an invoice, bill, purchase order or
other similar documentation from any customer, supplier or other contracting
party of any member of the Alkali Group is received by Seller and Seller
actually pays any amount with respect thereto due from any member of the
Alkali Group, upon receipt of written notice and reasonable supporting
documentation from Seller, Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
and all such amount actually paid by Seller. Either Party shall, at its
election, be permitted to offset from any amounts payable by such Party to
the other Party pursuant to _Sections 6.14(a)_ or _6.14(c)_ , as applicable,
any amounts due to such first Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(d)_.

 

6.15 _Restrictions on Use of Certain Real Property_. Purchaser acknowledges
that the Restricted Site is subject to a restrictive covenant as set forth in
the Restricted Site Deed that prohibits any form of digging or subsurface
invasions on the Restricted Site, and Purchaser hereby agrees that after the
Closing it shall (and shall cause its employees and Affiliates, including,
after the Closing, the members of the Alkali Group to) comply with such
restrictive covenant in all respects. If, after the Closing, Purchaser (or, if
applicable, the Purchaser Affiliate that acquires the Shares) or its
successors or assigns (x) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (y) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Purchaser (or such Purchaser Affiliate) or its successors or assigns shall
require that the definitive documentation for such consolidation, merger or
transfer include a binding provision requiring that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser (or such Purchaser Affiliate) assume all of the
obligations of Purchaser set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_.

 

6.16 _Financial Information_. As promptly as practical after the receipt of
written notice from Purchaser, from the date hereof until the Closing, Seller
shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) monthly financial and operating
information for the Alkali Group, in the same format that is currently
provided to and reviewed by management and that includes a monthly balance
sheet and profit and loss statement. The monthly balance sheet and profit and
loss statement will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis and in all material respects.

 



-62- 6.17 _Financial Statements_. As promptly as practical after the receipt of
written notice from Purchaser, from the date hereof until ninety (90) days
after the Closing, Seller agrees to prepare (i) the Supplemental Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and reflect, in all material respects,
the combined historical financial condition and results of operations, cash
flows, comprehensive income and changes in owners equity of the Alkali Group,
at the dates and for the periods indicated therein (subject to normal year-
end audit adjustments), in each case meeting the requirements of Section 3-05
and Section 3-10(g) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and (ii) as
promptly as practical, Financial Statements meeting the requirements of
Section 3-05 and Section 3-10(g) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
and any financial information relating to the Alkali Group or the Business as
required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by Purchaser and, if
applicable, meeting the requirements of Section 3-05 and Section 3-10(g) of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for
Sellers reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Sellers preparation of the Supplemental Financial
Statements and the financial information pursuant hereto.

 

6.18 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain and to consummate the Equity Financing and to obtain and,
if necessary, consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the flex provisions), subject to any amendments or modifications
thereto permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the applicable
Financing Commitments, subject to any amendments or modifications thereto
permitted by _Section 6.18(b)_, (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the applicable Debt Financing
Commitments on terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contained therein, subject to any amendments or modifications thereto
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.18(b)_, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions that are applicable to Purchaser contained in the applicable
Financing Commitments (or, in the case of the Debt Financing Commitments, any
definitive agreements relating thereto), including the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the
applicable Financing and due and payable by Purchaser, (iv) enforce its
rights under the applicable Financing Commitments (or, in the case of the Debt
Financing Commitments, any definitive agreements relating thereto), (v) comply
with its obligations under the applicable Financing Commitments (or, in the
case of the Debt Financing Commitments, any definitive agreements relating
thereto) and (vi) consummate, as necessary, the applicable Financing at or
prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall provide such information as shall be
necessary to keep Seller informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the debt Financing (including
providing the Company with copies of all definitive agreements and other
documents related to the Debt Financing). Purchaser shall give the Company
prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any party of any of the
Financing Commitments to the extent it would impair or

 



-63-  delay the Closing or result in insufficient financing to consummate this
Agreement or any termination of any of the Financing Commitments. In the event
Purchaser becomes aware that all or any portion of the Debt Financing has
become unavailable, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and shall, in
consultation with Seller, use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange
as promptly as practicable any such portion from alternative sources on terms
and conditions no less favorable to Purchaser and to Seller than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and that would not have any
of the effects specified in _Section 6.18(b)_ (any such alternative
financing, " _Alternative Financing_ "). If an Alternative Financing is
required in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.18(a)_, Purchaser shall
obtain, and when obtained, provide Seller with a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing, and Purchaser shall
comply with its covenants in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18(a)_ and _Section
6.18(b)_ with respect to such new financing commitment (as if such financing
commitment were the Debt Commitment Letter). Purchaser shall give Seller
prompt notice of (A) subject to any amendments or modifications permitted by
Section 6.18(b), the expiration or termination of all or any portion of the
Financing Commitments (including pursuant to any Alternative Financing) or any
definitive documentation relating to the foregoing; (B) for any reason, all or
any portion of the Financing (including pursuant to any Alternative Financing
or definitive documents relating to any of the foregoing) becoming
unavailable; or (C) a breach or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Commitments or Alternative Financing (including any definitive documents
relating to any of the foregoing) of which Purchaser becomes aware.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, agree to or permit
any amendment, replacements, supplement or other modification of, or waive any
of its rights or remedies under the Securities Purchase Agreement, Debt
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter (or any definitive agreements executed in
connection therewith); _provided_ that Purchaser may (i) make such amendments,
replacements, supplements, modifications or waivers if they (w) do not add new
(or adversely modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of the
Financing as compared to those in the Securities Purchase Agreement, Debt
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as of the date hereof, (x) do not adversely
affect the ability of Purchaser to timely consummate the Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including, by making the conditions therein
less likely to be satisfied or materially delaying, materially impeding, or
preventing the Closing), (y) do not adversely affect the ability of Purchaser
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Securities Purchase
Agreement, Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or in any definitive agreements executed in connection therewith
or (z) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing contemplated thereunder
in such a manner that would be reasonably likely to hinder or delay the
Closing or the date on which the Financing would be obtained or that would
cause the aggregate amount of Financing to equal an amount that would not
equal or exceed the Purchase Price and (ii) amend the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Securities Purchase Agreement to add investors, underwriters, initial
purchasers, placement agents, lenders, lead arrangers, book runners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Securities Purchase Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement, so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the availability of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Equity Financing under the Securities Purchase Agreement.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller copies (redacted only as to fee

 



-64-  amounts, dates and certain other economic terms, including in respect of
"market flex" and "securities demand" provisions, in the case of the Fee
Letters) of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter or Securities Purchase
Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and cause the members of the Alkali Group and their respective officers,
employees and advisors, including financial and accounting advisors, of Seller
and the members of the Alkali Group, to provide such cooperation as is
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the Financing (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries), including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of lender meetings and calls, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, due diligence sessions (including
accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with prospective underwriters,
initial purchasers, placement agents, lenders, investors and ratings agencies,
in each case at mutually agreed times; (ii) assisting Purchaser in the
preparation of (A) a customary offering document, prospectus supplement,
private placement memorandum and/or bank information memorandum and similar
marketing documents for any of the Financing and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations; (iii) providing the Supplemental Financial Statements;
(iv) requesting that its independent auditors cooperate with the Financing
Sources and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause such independent
auditors to provide customary "comfort" letters (including "negative
assurance" comfort), together with drafts of such comfort letters such
independent accountants are prepared to deliver upon the "pricing" of any
debt or equity securities; and (v) participation by the senior management team
of the Alkali Group in the marketing activities undertaken in connection with
the marketing of the Financing, including (A) assisting in the preparation of
a customary bankbook, offering memorandum, confidential information
memorandum, prospectus supplement, lender presentations, syndication
documents, business projections and similar documents and (B) attending a
reasonable number of meetings at mutually agreeable times with prospective
lenders or debt or equity investors, sessions with rating agencies for the
Financing and due diligence sessions; (vi) providing customary authorization
and/or representation letters in connection with the distribution of the bank
information memoranda contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters to
prospective lenders and identifying any portion of the information therein
that constitutes material non-public information regarding the Alkali Group;
_provided_ that such letters and confirmations expressly state that (x) no
member of the Seller Group shall have any liability of any kind or
nature resulting from the use of information in connection with their
cooperation with arranging the Financing and (y) the recipient of such letters
of authorization shall be entitled to rely only on the representations and
warranties contained in the Financing documents; (vii) facilitating the
execution and delivery by the appropriate officers of the Alkali Group of
underwriting or purchase agreements, loan agreements, pledge and security
documents and other definitive documents and/or certificates contemplated by
the Financing; (viii) cooperating in the replacement or backstop of any
outstanding letters of credit issued for the account of the Business or any
joint venture thereof; (ix) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources,
on at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice, with all
documentation and other information with respect to the Alkali Group required
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering laws, rules
and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent requested, not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the date specified by Purchaser or
the Financing Sources; and (x) consenting to the use of the logos of
the Business so long as such

 



-65-  use is not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Business or its
reputation, goodwill, products, services, offerings or intellectual property
rights; _provided_ that (v) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, provide any security,
make any representations, provide any indemnification or incur any other
Liability in connection with the Financing, (x) the effectiveness of any
documentation executed by Seller with respect to the Financing shall be
subject to the consummation of the Closing, (y) neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to deliver (1) any financial information in a
form not customarily prepared by the Seller or its Affiliates or (2) any
financial information with respect to a fiscal period that has not yet ended,
and (z) Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse
and indemnify Seller for all costs or Liabilities incurred by Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the Financing (including any Alternative
Financing), any such cooperation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.18(c)_ or
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Alkali Group provided by Seller or its
Subsidiaries in writing for the purpose of arranging the Financing or any
representations and warranties hereunder), except to the extent such costs or
Liabilities are the direct result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or other representatives
(acting in their capacity as such). Any information provided to Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.18(c)_ shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ __ and _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

 

6.19 _Title and Survey_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Purchaser (at Purchasers sole cost and expense) in obtaining title
commitments, title policies and surveys with respect to the Real Property;
_provided_ that the scope, amount or duration of the liability of Seller or
its Affiliates, and their representations, warranties or indemnities, shall
not be expanded beyond what is otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this
Agreement with respect to Real Property.

 

6.20 _Other Conveyances_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall and shall cause Seller Parent to
assign, transfer and convey (or cause to be assigned, transferred and

case, pursuant to a form of assignment approved by Purchaser (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) Seller shall not amend, waive or modify, or assign, transfer, convey or
otherwise dispose of (or permit the amendment, waiver, modification,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of) any of the rights,
title and interests under, the Contracts listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.20_ __ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule other than pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.20_.

6.21 _Exclusive Dealing_. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier

encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person
relating to any business combination with the Company or its Subsidiaries or
the sale of a material portion of the assets (other than the sale of inventory
in the ordinary course of business) 

 



-66-  and/or capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Company
Transaction_ "), (b) enter into or participate in any negotiations, nor

behalf of itself and the Seller Group) fully, finally and irrevocably
releases, acquits and forever discharges the Alkali Group and each of its
officers, directors, partners, general partners, limited partners, managing
directors, members, managers, stockholders, trustees, shareholders,

(b) As of the Closing Date, Seller further irrevocably agrees not to, directly
or indirectly, and to cause Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) commence, institute or cause to be commenced any

Person based on or arising from any Causes of Action, or (ii) assert any

Accounts and Intercompany Advances except for those accounts and Contracts
listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.23_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule between any
member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Alkali

or any of its Affiliates removing from any member of the Alkali Group all cash
and cash equivalents or funds from cash pools by means of dividends,
distributions, the creation or repayment of intercompany debt, increasing or
decreasing of cash pool balances or paid-in capital or otherwise), subject

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that
prior to the Valuation Time, Seller may capitalize Intercompany Advances
between Seller or other member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and any

Closing Adjustment. 

6.24 _Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any right, property or

Purchaser in error, either directly or indirectly, Purchaser shall (i)
transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
members of the Alkali Group) to transfer, at no cost to Seller or the other
members of the Seller Group, such right, property or asset (and any related
Liability) as soon as practicable to one or more members of the Seller Group
indicated by Seller and (ii) ensure that the member of the Purchaser Group
shall where permitted by the terms on which such member has the right to such
asset, hold the asset (or part thereof), and any monies, goods or other
benefits arising after the Closing by virtue of it, as agent of and trustee

-68- ARTICLE VII

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

7.1  _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
(i) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date
of such Continuing Employees (as defined below) termination of employment
with the Alkali Group, Purchaser shall cause the Alkali Group to take all
action necessary so that each person employed by a member of the Alkali Group
as of immediately before the Closing who continues to be employed by a member
of the Alkali Group immediately after the Closing (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") shall receive (i) base wages or salaries and cash bonus
opportunity amounts that are no less favorable to such Continuing Employees
than the rates of wages and salaries paid, and cash bonus opportunity amounts
offered, to such Continuing Employees on the Closing Date, and (ii) employee
benefit plans and programs, other than equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension, retiree welfare, change in control and retention programs,
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate as those provided to such
Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date (excluding equity-based
compensation, defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, change in control and
retention programs); _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated on or prior to the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Alkali Group to provide such Continuing Employee with non-equity-based
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those non-equity-based
severance benefits available to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Closing. This _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ shall not apply to any
Continuing Employees who are covered by a Union Agreement or CBA.

 

(b) Purchaser further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall and shall cause the Alkali Group to grant all Continuing Employees
credit for any service with the Alkali Group or any of their predecessors
earned prior to the Closing Date for eligibility, vesting, and level of
benefits and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Purchaser or the Alkali Group or their respective Affiliates
on or after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), to the same extent as each
such employee was entitled before the Closing Date to credit for such service
under any similar Benefit Plan in which such employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, Purchaser shall (i) cause to be waived
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a
Continuing Employee under any Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii)
cause any deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximums paid on or
before the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) under any Benefit Plan to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximum
provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan for the year
in which the Closing Date occurs. This _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not apply
to any Continuing Employees who are covered by a Union Agreement or CBA.

 



-69- (c) As of the Closing Date, the Alkali Group shall terminate its participation
in each Benefit Plan sponsored by Seller or any Affiliate (" _Seller Benefit
Plan_ "), and in no event shall any Continuing Employee be entitled to accrue
any benefits under such Seller Benefit Plans with respect to services rendered
or compensation paid on or after the Closing Date, unless required by the
terms of the applicable Seller Benefit Plan or applicable Law. The Alkali
Group shall retain or assume all rights, liabilities and obligations under
each other Benefit Plan, whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit or impair
the ability of Purchaser Indemnified Parties to be indemnified in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or any insurance policy for a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

(d) On and after the Closing, the terms and conditions of employment of
union-represented Continuing Employees who are employed by the Alkali Group on
the Closing Date shall be governed by the applicable CBA or other Union
Agreement covering such union-represented employees immediately prior to the
Closing, and Purchaser shall, or shall cause Alkali Group to, assume and honor
such Union Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser further agrees
that, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Alkali Group to grant all of their union-represented employees credit for any
service with the Alkali Group or any of their predecessors earned prior to the
Closing Date for all purposes under any applicable Union Agreement, including
without limitation any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement.

(e) Provided that on or before the Closing the Company has supplied Purchaser
with a true and complete list of employee layoffs, by date and location, of
all employee layoffs implemented by the Alkali Group in the 90-day period
preceding the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
from all obligations and liabilities arising under the WARN Act as a result,
in whole or in part, of the actions or omissions of Purchaser and the Alkali
Group with respect to the Continuing Employees occurring on or after the
Closing. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from all
obligations and liabilities arising under the WARN Act as a result, in whole
or in part, of the actions or omissions of Sellers and the Alkali Group with
respect to any employees other than the Continuing Employees. Seller shall
also indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from all obligations and
liabilities arising under the WARN Act as a result, in whole or in part, of
the actions or omissions of Sellers and the Alkali Group with respect to any
Continuing Employees occurring prior to and on the Closing.

(f) Purchaser agrees that, to the extent retention bonus amounts pursuant to
the 2017 Alkali Annual Incentive Plan communicated to employees of the Alkali
Group in writing prior to the date hereof remain unpaid as of immediately
following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable member
of the Alkali Group, to pay such bonuses in accordance with the terms
communicated to such employees in writing within 60 days after the Closing
Date, provided that Seller has provided Purchaser with all terms and
documents required for Purchaser to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) the
parties do not intend for this Agreement to (nor shall it) amend any Union
Agreement, Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement or create any rights or 

 



-70-  obligations except between the parties, (ii) no Continuing Employee,
including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other Person not a
party to this Agreement, shall have any rights under this _Article VII_ or be
entitled to assert any claim under this _Article VII_ , (iii) nothing in this
Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee for any
definite period following the Closing Date and (iv) nothing in this _Article
VII_ is intended to be the adoption of any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or shall limit or impair the ability of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to amend or modify any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement.

(h) From and after the Closing, Seller will (and Seller will cause its
Affiliates to) retain and be solely responsible for and will fully perform,
pay and discharge, in accordance with their terms, all Liabilities in respect
of Continuing Employees and former employees of the Business (and claims by
or relating to such Persons) with respect to Seller Equity Awards. On the
Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreements
governing the terms of the Seller Equity Awards, Seller will (i) accelerate
the vesting and settlement of a pro rata portion of the Seller Equity Awards
held by each Continuing Employee that vest solely based on continued service
(such Seller Equity Awards, the " _Time-Vesting Seller Equity Awards_ "),
with such pro ration based on the amount of the Time-Vesting Seller Equity
Awards that would have become vested on the next regularly scheduled vesting
date following the Closing Date in an amount determined by multiplying the
number of Time-Vesting Seller Equity Awards that were eligible to become
vested on the next regularly scheduled vesting date following the Closing Date
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the
period beginning on the vesting date immediately preceding the Closing Date
and ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12),
and (ii) cause a pro rata portion of the Seller Equity Awards held by each
Continuing Employee that vest based both on continued service and the
achievement of applicable performance goals (such Seller Equity Awards, the "
_Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Awards_ ") to remain outstanding and
eligible for vesting at the end of the performance period applicable to each
such Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Award, with such pro ration based on
(A) the number of full months in the service period from the applicable
Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Award grant date through the Closing Date,
relative to (B) the number of full months in the entire service period
contemplated by the applicable Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Award (the
Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Awards so eligible to vest, the "
_Eligible-Vesting Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Awards_ "). At the end of
the applicable performance period with respect to an Eligible-Vesting
Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Award, Seller shall cause the applicable
award to vest or be forfeited, based on the actual achievement of the
applicable performance goals. For the avoidance of doubt, all Time-Vesting
Seller Equity Awards that do not vest pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_
and all Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Awards that are not Eligible-
Vesting Performance-Vesting Seller Equity Awards shall be forfeited for no
consideration and without any further action by any of the parties hereto
effective as of the Closing. The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ shall give Purchaser or its Affiliates after
the Closing Date any right or responsibility to enforce the obligations set

Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date therefor (taking into account any extensions). Seller shall provide
any comments to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of receipt of any such
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return and Purchaser shall revise such Straddle
Period Separate Return to reflect any reasonable comments received from Seller
with respect to such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return. Purchaser shall not
amend or revoke any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns (or any
notification or election relating thereto) without the prior written consent
of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). At Sellers reasonable request and expense, Purchaser shall file, or
cause to be filed, amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns.

responsibility pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_, then Purchaser shall claim

or _(b)_ ;  _provided_ that Seller shall not be entitled to any refunds to
the extent such refunds were reflected as an asset in Working Capital on the
Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Purchaser shall be entitled to any
refunds or credits of any member of the Alkali Group of or against any Taxes
of such member other than refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled
pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of or against Taxes
of the members of the Alkali Group for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
8.5(b)_. Each Party shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the Party
entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes under this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_,

the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit, net of any Taxes otherwise
due from the Party otherwise entitled to such refund or credit, and net of any

available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of such refund
or credit or the application of such refund or credit or against amounts
otherwise payable.

 

8.6 _Tax Contests_.

(a) If any Tax Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other Party or Parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such Party to give such prompt
notice shall not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations under this
_Article VIII_ , except to the extent that the other Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Tax Authority.

Seller shall provide Purchaser with a timely and reasonably detailed account
of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Seller shall consult with the

the extent such action could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect

Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in
interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (v) Purchaser shall be

compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior

Affiliates in any Post-Closing Period.

Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax

greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding or Seller if
Seller and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax
liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding; and " _Non-Controlling

treat such purchase and sale (and deemed purchase and sale) as a purchase and
sale of the Companys and Tronox Alkali Wyoming Corporations assets for
federal income Tax and state income and or franchise Tax purposes. In
connection with the making of the Section 336(e) Elections, (i) Purchaser will
enter into a written, binding agreement with Seller on or before the due date
of Sellers federal income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the

execution and timely filing of such other forms, returns, elections, schedules

assist, and shall cause its representatives to assist, Purchaser and its
representatives in the preparation of the Section 336(e) Allocation, and (y)
shall provide Purchaser and its representatives with any information

Section 336(e) Allocation Review Period, deliver a written notice to

setting forth its objections. Unless Seller delivers the Section 336(e)
Allocation Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the Section 336(e)
Allocation Review Period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
determinations set forth in the Section 336(e) Allocation. If Seller delivers
the Section 336(e) Allocation Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the
Section 336(e) Allocation Review Period, Seller and Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
determinations. If

 



-77-  Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any disagreements with respect to the
Section 336(e) Allocation, Purchaser and Seller jointly agree that the
Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve such differences, with the fees and
costs of such tax or valuation expert to be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, and with the decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm as to any matters in dispute between Purchaser
and Seller to be binding and conclusive on all Parties. The Parties agree not
to take any position, in connection with any Tax Return, audit or similar
proceeding related to Taxes, that is inconsistent with the Section
336(e) Allocation as prepared (or resolved) pursuant to this Section _
8.10(c)_ unless otherwise required by law. In the event of any adjustment to
the AGUB requiring an amendment to the Section 336(e) Allocation, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver such amendment to Seller and such amended Section
336(e) Allocation shall, subject to the review and dispute resolution
provisions of this Section _ 8.10(c)_, become the Section 336(e) Allocation.

Agreement, Purchaser shall pay one-hundred percent (100%) of any applicable
Transfer Taxes when due. The Party responsible under applicable Law for filing
the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely
file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the

Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other
filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

case earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Tax Authority;

shall be governed exclusively by this _Article VIII_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.7
_and  _Section_ __ _ 11.8_ and (ii) the provisions of _Article XI_ (other
than _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ _and Section_ __ _ 11.8_) shall not apply to
indemnification with respect to Taxes or the procedures relating thereto;
provided that indemnification with respect to Taxes attributable to the Seller
Pre-Closing Period and the procedures relating thereto shall be governed
additionally by  _Section 11.2(c)_ and _Section 11.3(c)_.

_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ would not be satisfied; or

 

(d) by Purchaser if Seller or the Company shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform
(A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _

11.2 _Indemnification by_ _Seller_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article XI_ and except with respect to
indemnification for Taxes which shall be governed by  _Article VIII_ ,
effective as of and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including members of the Alkali Group)
and their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the
extent arising out of or relating to (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller or the Company contained in _Article
III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement (except for _Section_ __ _ 3.13_

Party against, or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified Party for, any Losses

Capital and reflected or reserved for on the Final Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement or otherwise included in the calculation of the Post-Closing
Adjustment;

(ii) unless such claim individually or a series of related claims involves
Losses in excess of $300,000 (the " _De_ _Minimis_ _Amount_ "), it being
understood that if such Losses do not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such
Losses shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Losses under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_;

 

(iii) until the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Losses
under  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ exceeds $6,500,000 (the "

__ _ 11.2(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ exceed the Cap.

 

(d) If applicable, any Losses that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
entitled to recover pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ for any
inaccuracy or breach of Seller Fundamental Representations (other than
constituting fraud) or _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall be satisfied in the
following order of recovery: (i) first, solely to the extent any portion of
the retention amount under the transaction representation and warranties
insurance policy acquired by Purchaser in connection with this Agreement (the

set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, (ii) second, by submission of claims

_i_ _)_ , (i) unless such claim individually or a series of related claims
involves Losses in excess of the De Minimis Amount, it being understood that
if such Losses do 

 



-84-  not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such Losses shall not be applied to or
considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Seller
Indemnified Parties Losses under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_, (ii) until
the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Parties Losses under _Section_ __
_ 11.3(a)(i)_ exceeds the Deductible, it being understood that if such Losses

11.3(a)(i)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses exceed the
Cap.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary (including _Section_
__ _ 11.3(b)_), no claim for indemnification pursuant to (i) _ Section_ __ _
11.3(a)(_ _i_ _)_ arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy or breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.1_
(Organization and Qualification), _5.2_ (Authority Relative to this
Agreement), and _5.6_ (Brokers) (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Fundamental Representations_ ") or (ii) constituting fraud of Purchaser or
its Affiliates shall be subject to the De Minimis Amount, the Deductible or
the Cap; _provided_ that, the maximum aggregate indemnification amount to
which the Seller Indemnified Parties may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __

avoidance of doubt, Losses arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy or
breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation shall not be included for the
purpose of determining whether the aggregate amount of Losses under _Section_
__ _ 11.3(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ exceed the Cap.

 

11.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Party or Parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened Action, Order, claim or demand that the Indemnified
Party has determined gives or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened Action, Order, claim or demand asserted by a third Party against
the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_
"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect
to the subject matter of such claim or demand to the extent then known;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article XI_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure, it being agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior
to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section_ __
_ 11.1_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
11.3(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party, acknowledging its irrevocable and unconditional obligation
to fully indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that
may result from such Third Party Claim, delivered within twenty (20) Business
Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
and control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party); _provided_ that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the

 



-85-  Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim (but not control or make decisions related thereto)
with its own counsel and at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume or maintain the defense
of any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or
in lieu of monetary damages, any injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliates thereof), (ii) the Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party
Claim, or the Indemnified Party has available to it one or more defenses
or counterclaims that are inconsistent with or different from those that may
be available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim,
(iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the Third Party Claim would be materially detrimental to or
materially injure the reputation, future business prospects or position in any
other action of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (v) the Indemnifying
Party has failed to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim,
(vi) the Third Party Claim would give rise to Losses which are more than the
amount indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or (vii)
the Indemnified Partys third party insurer has assumed the defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and
control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim (but not control or make decisions related
thereto) with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing
and competence and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the defense
or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Purchaser or Seller, as the case may
be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with such other Person in the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses, as
appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and without the
consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement or judgment
involves any injunctive relief binding on any of the Indemnified Parties or
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall (A)
pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment (other than
to the extent that such liabilities would constitute Losses to which the De
Minimis Amount, Deductible or Cap would be applicable in accordance with the
applicable provisions of _Sections 11.2(b)_ and _11.2(c)_ or _Sections
11.3(b)_ and _11.3(c)_ , as applicable) and (B) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Parties potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. No
Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned and delayed); _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any
such claim if it irrevocably waives in a writing delivered to the Indemnifying
Party any right to indemnity therefor under this Agreement.

 



-86- 11.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except in the case of fraud and except
with respect to (a) the matters covered by _Sections 2.5_ , _2.6_ , _2.7_ ,
_12.10_ or _12.13_ , (b) the Ancillary Agreements and (c) with respect to any
matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by
_Article VIII_ , _Sections 11.1_ , _11.2_ and _11.3_ ), Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of _Sections 11.2_ and _11.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, and their respective
Affiliates, including with respect to Purchaser after the Closing, the members
of the Alkali Group, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for
breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability or
otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Sale, including any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive
any right of rescission they or their respective Affiliates may otherwise have
or to which they may become entitled.

11.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this  _Article XI_ , all Losses shall
be net of any third-party insurance and indemnity proceeds (other than the
proceeds of the RandW Policy) that are actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification (it being agreed that if such third-party insurance or
indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the
Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made), in each case net of any
costs incurred to recover such amounts or any increase in premiums resulting
from such claim. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any recovery by Purchaser from the RandW Policy), the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any
and all rights that the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties
with respect to the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall assign any and all such rights to the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, or the amount of any Loss related to any such
breach or inaccuracy, under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __
_ 11.3(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement and in any certificate furnished pursuant to this Agreement
shall be considered without giving effect to any materiality limitation or
qualification (including the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect")
(other than references to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" (x) solely
with respect to the standard that must be met to create an obligation to
include items in a list set forth in a Company Disclosure Schedule or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule or (y) contained within the definition of
"Permitted Lien"); _provided_ , that this sentence shall not apply to (i) the
phrase "in all material respects" set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_ and (ii) the

 



-87-  representations and warranties set forth in the last sentence of _Section_
__ _ 3.6_. The right to indemnification shall not be affected by any
investigation or audit conducted prior to or after Closing or the knowledge
of any party of any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by any
other party at any time. Each Party shall have the right, irrespective of any
knowledge or investigation, to rely fully on the representations, warranties
and covenants of the other Parties in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

11.7 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party have
liability to any Indemnified Party for any punitive damages or damages that
are not reasonably foreseeable; _provided_ that, in each case, such limitation
shall not limit recovery to the extent any such damages (i) are the result of
fraud or (ii) are payable to a Third Party as part of a Third Party Claim
against an Indemnified Party that is indemnifiable hereunder. To the extent
any claim may be recoverable pursuant to more than one section of this
_Article XI_ , the Indemnified Party may make such claim under any such
section in the alternative; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Liability for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery
by reason of state of facts giving rise to such Liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

11.8 _Tax Benefits_. Payments made to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the
Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Sections 8.1_ , _8.2_ , _11.2(a)_ or
_11.3(a)_ in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any
Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such Loss by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or the Seller Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates, as applicable.

Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Financing, and
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action shall be
heard and determined in such court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The Parties further
agree, (i) to the extent permitted by Law, that final and unappealable
judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside
the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment and (ii) that
service of process upon such Party in any such action or proceeding shall be
effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.6_.

 



-89- (c) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE, INCLUDING THEIR
RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND PERMITTED ASSIGNS), OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS
EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER
LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO PARTY WILL
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH
ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 12.2_. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY
WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
_SECTION 12.2_ WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party agrees (i)
that (x) any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement, the Financing, any Alternative Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Fee Letters (or any commitment letter or fee letter in
connection with an Alternative Financing) or the transactions or services
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in a state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York,
New York and the appellate courts thereof, (y) it will not, and will not
permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support anyone else in
bringing such claim, suit, action or proceeding in any court other than a
state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of
New York, New York and (z) each Party submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii)
that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to it at its address provided in _Section 12.6_ shall be effective
service of process against it for any such action brought in any such court,

by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any
such Action in any such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, (v) that the Laws of the
State of New York shall govern any such Action and (vi) to irrevocably waive
and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such action to the same
extent such rights are waived pursuant to clause (c) of this _Section 11.2_.

 



-90- 12.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary
Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
any prior discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet,
agreement, understanding or arrangement, written or oral, and there are no
agreements, understandings, representations or warranties between the Parties
other than those set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

 

12.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) _ Section_ __ _ 6.11,_
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and _ Section 11.3_, which are intended to benefit,
and to be enforceable by, the Persons specified therein, and (iii) _ Section
12.2(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 12.4_, the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 12.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 12.8_, and _Section_ __ _ 12.15_, which are intended to
benefit and to be enforceable by the Financing Sources (it being understood
such Financing Sources shall be third-party beneficiaries of such
provisions), this Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, is not intended to confer on or on
behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and
assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to
the subject matter or any provision hereof.

 

12.5 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this Agreement, whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or not, all legal
and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
(including Seller in respect of Seller Expenses) incurring such costs and
expenses unless expressly otherwise contemplated in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the expenses of the members of the Alkali
Group in connection with seeking consents and approvals required pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.12_ of this Agreement shall be borne
by Purchaser and (ii) Seller Expenses shall be borne by Seller.

12.7 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of the other Party to this Agreement;
_provided_ that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations to another
member of the Purchaser Group; _provided_ , _further_ , that in such event
Purchaser shall remain liable for its obligations hereunder notwithstanding
such assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary included in the
preceding sentence, Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller, collaterally
assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Debt Financing Source as
collateral security.

12.8 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against
whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Either Party
to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by
the other Party to this Agreement with any term or provision of this
Agreement on the part of such other Party to this Agreement to be performed or
complied with. The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a breach of any 

 



-92-  term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of
any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any
right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,  _Section_ __ _
12.2(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 12.4_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 12.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 12.15_ and this _Section_ __ _ 12.8_ (and any
other provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision that would modify the substance of such
Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in
any manner that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources,
as applicable.

12.9  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

12.10 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity and (ii) the
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ (A) are not intended to and do
not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement prior to its valid termination and (B) shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction. The foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any
Party is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree
that nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.10_ shall require any Party
to institute any Action for (or limit any Partys right to institute any
Action for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 12.10_ prior to
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article X_. If
any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which such action
is pending, _plus_ twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action.

 



-93- 12.11 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a third party,
that Seller or any of its Affiliates or any such third party is or is not in
breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or observance of any
term or provisions of any Contract.

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by either of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

12.13 _Parent Guarantee_.

 

(a) In order to induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, Seller Parent
hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, their successors and assigns, the full
performance and observation of all the terms, covenants, conditions,
provisions and agreements to be performed or observed by Seller or the Company
when required to be performed or observed, and the payment in full of all
amounts owed by Seller and the Company to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
when due and payable, in each case in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Such guarantee shall be as primary
obligor and not merely as surety, shall be a guarantee of payment and
performance and not of collection and shall be a continuing guarantee. Seller
Parent hereby waives acceptance, diligence, promptness, presentment, demand
of payment or performance, filing of claims with a court in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy of Seller or the Company, any right to require a
proceeding (or other exhaustion of remedies) first against Seller or the
Company or to join Seller or the Company in any enforcement action or to
first resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance, protest,
notice and all demands whatsoever. Seller Parent agrees to pay any and all
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in enforcing any rights
under this _Section_ __ _ 12.13_. Seller Parent hereby makes all of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Sections 4.1_ (except that the
reference to the "State of Delaware" shall be deemed to be replaced by
"Commonwealth of Australia"), _4.2_ and _4.3_ , with references therein to
"Seller" deemed to be replaced by "Seller Parent". Seller Parent hereby
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by all of the provisions of _Article XII_
of this Agreement. References in _Section_ __ _ 12.13(a)_ to the Company
shall be deemed to mean and refer to the obligations of Company prior to the
Closing.

(b) Seller Parent hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Seller (in such
capacity, the " _Process Agent_ ") as its authorized agent to accept and
acknowledge on its behalf, in the manner provided for notices to Seller, as
the Seller, in _Section_ __ _ 12.6_ of this Agreement, service of any and
all process which may be served in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and hereby consents to process being served upon the Process
Agent in any such Action. Seller hereby accepts the foregoing
appointment. Seller Parent irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, all claim of error by reason of any such service and agrees
that such service shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon it in any such Action and shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, be taken and held to be valid and personal service upon and personal
delivery to it. If Seller ceases to act as Process Agent at any time, Seller
Parent covenants and agrees to designate irrevocably and appoint without
delay another such agent domiciled in the U.S. reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser and to deliver promptly to Purchaser evidence in writing of such
other agents acceptance of such appointment.

 



-94- 12.14 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted
as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates and the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to
act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates (which will no longer
include the Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of
Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause
its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Seller and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its
Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in
the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not
the Company or its Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall not, without Sellers consent, have access to any such
communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to its
engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) Seller and
its Affiliates (and not the Company or its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b)
to the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates
(and not the Company or its Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and
(c) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose
any such attorney-client communications or files to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and
Ellis LLP and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Purchaser
further agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries
(including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), that from and
after Closing (a) the attorney-client privilege, all other evidentiary
privileges, and the expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client
Communications belong to Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, and (b) Seller will have
the exclusive right to control, assert, or waive the attorney-client
privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the expectation of client
confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client Communications. Accordingly,
Purchaser will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (including, after
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, (x) assert any attorney-
client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client Communication, except in the
event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not a Seller or a
Sellers Affiliate; or (y) take any action which could cause any Attorney-
Client Communication to cease being a confidential communication or to
otherwise lose protection under the attorney-client privilege or any other
evidentiary privilege, including waiving such protection in any dispute with a
Person that is not a Seller or a Sellers Affiliate. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or any member
of the Alkali Group, on the one hand, and a third party (other than a party to
this Agreement), on the other hand, after the Closing, the Purchaser and the
Company may assert any attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of any
such communications with Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such third party; _provided_
, that the Company

 



-95-  may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.
Furthermore, Purchaser agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its
Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries),
that in the event of a dispute between any Seller or any Sellers Affiliate on
the one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other arising
out of or relating to any matter in which Kirkland and Ellis LLP jointly
represented both parties, neither the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary
privilege will protect from disclosure to such Seller or Sellers Affiliate
any information or documents developed or shared during the course of Kirkland
and Ellis LLPs joint representation. " _Attorney-Client Communication_  means
any communication occurring on or prior to Closing between Kirkland and Ellis
LLP on the one hand and the Company, its Subsidiaries, any Seller, or any of
their respective Affiliates on the other hand that in any way relates to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any representation,
warranty, or covenant of any party under this Agreement or any related
agreement.

12.15 _Exculpation of Financing Sources_

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Seller
shall have no rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ that, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the Purchaser in
respect of the Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. Seller
(i) agrees that it shall not have the right to seek or obtain money damages or
expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) from any Financing Source, (ii) waives any and all claims against
each Financing Source and (iii) hereby agrees that in no event shall any
Financing Source have any liability or obligation to the Seller relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter related
thereto or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source shall be subject to
any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a
tortious nature.

(c) Solely for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 12.15_, "Seller" shall be deemed
to include each of the Seller Groups respective controlled affiliates and
their and its respective controlled affiliates stockholders, partners,
members, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons, agents and
representatives.
