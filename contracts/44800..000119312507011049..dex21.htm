this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence an offer (as amended or supplemented in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase for cash all of the shares of common stock, par value $0.02 per share (the &#147;<U>Common

enter into this Agreement, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Company Convertible Notes, warrants (to purchase Common Stock) issued in connection with the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, and warrants (to
purchase Common Stock) issued in connection with the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, the &#147;<U>Convertible Instruments</U>&#148;) have entered into a Conversion, Tender and Voting Agreement (the &#147;<U>Tender and Voting
Agreement</U>&#148;) with the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, pursuant to which each such holder has, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Tender and Voting Agreement, agreed to, among other things, (i)&nbsp;consent to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;convert or exercise, as applicable, effective as of the Expiration Date, all Convertible Instruments held by such holder (except as set forth herein, any Company Warrants held by such
holder shall be purchased by Merger Sub without the exercise or conversion of such Company Warrants), (iii)&nbsp;tender their Shares (including the Shares acquired upon conversion or exercise of the applicable Convertible Instruments) in response to
the Offer, and (iv)&nbsp;vote their Shares in favor of the Merger and against any competing transaction; </FONT></P>
