iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 20, 2007 (this
"Agreement") is by and among QinetiQ North America Operations, LLC, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Apollo Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
Analex Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

A. The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") and the boards
of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders to enter into
the business combination transaction described herein, and have approved the
Merger (as defined below) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
proposed that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence an offer (as amended or supplemented in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase for cash all of
the shares of common stock, par value $0.02 per share (the " _Common Stock_
"), of the Company outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer (the "
_Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $3.70 (subject to any applicable
withholding), net to the seller in cash (such price, or such higher price
per Share as may be paid in the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

C. The Transaction Committee (as defined below), the Company Board and the
boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved and declared the
advisability of this Agreement, the Offer and the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company following the consummation of the Offer (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 2.2), other than Shares owned directly or indirectly by
Parent or Merger Sub and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price;

D. The Company Board has resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and has approved, adopted and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger;

E. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter
into this Agreement, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Company Convertible Notes, warrants (to purchase Common
Stock) issued in connection with the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock, and
warrants (to purchase Common Stock) issued in connection with the issuance of
Series B Preferred Stock (collectively, the " _Convertible Instruments_ ")
have entered into a Conversion, Tender and Voting Agreement (the " _Tender and
Voting Agreement_ ") with the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, pursuant to
which each such holder has, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Tender and Voting Agreement, agreed to, among other things, (i) consent to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
convert or exercise, as applicable, effective as of the Expiration Date, all
Convertible Instruments held by such holder (except as set forth herein, any
Company Warrants held by such holder shall be purchased by Merger Sub without
the exercise or conversion of such Company Warrants), (iii) tender their
Shares (including the Shares acquired upon conversion or exercise of the
applicable Convertible Instruments) in response to the Offer, and (iv) vote
their Shares in favor of the Merger and against any competing transaction; F. It is intended that Parent will be treated as the acquiring entity for
accounting purposes; and 

G. Certain definitions of capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not
otherwise defined herein are set forth in Exhibit A hereto. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and so long as none of the
events or circumstances set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of _Annex A_
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Parent shall cause Merger Sub as
promptly as practicable (and in any event on or before the 10th calendar day
after the date hereof) to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer at the Offer Price. The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment and to pay for Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be subject solely to
those conditions set forth in _Annex A_. The conditions to the Offer set forth
on _Annex A_ are for the benefit of Merger Sub and may be asserted or waived
only by Merger Sub; _provided,_ _however_ , that without the prior consent of
the Company, Merger Sub shall not waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in
_Annex A_ ). The initial expiration date of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ", and any expiration date after the Initial Expiration
Date, the " _Expiration Date_ ") shall be the 20th Business Day following the
commencement of the Offer.

(b) Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify
the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided,_ _however_ , that without
the prior consent of the Company, no modification or change may be made which
(i) decreases the Offer Price ( _except_ as permitted by this Agreement), (ii)
changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding
consideration), (iii) changes the Minimum Condition, (iv) reduces or limits
the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (v) changes the conditions
to the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares, (vi) imposes
additional conditions to the Offer, (vii) extends the Offer _except_ as
provided in the next sentence, or (viii) makes any other change which is
adverse to the holders of the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger
Sub may, without the consent of the Company, (i) if at the then-scheduled
expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to Merger Subs obligations
to accept for payment and pay for Shares shall not be satisfied or
waived, extend and re-extend the Offer on one or more occasions for such
period as is reasonably necessary to permit such conditions to be satisfied,
(ii) extend and re-extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, and
(iii) extend and re-extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an aggregate
period of not more than 20 Business Days beyond the latest Expiration Date
that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence
if, as of such date, the Minimum Condition has been satisfied but less than
90% of the outstanding Shares (on a fully diluted basis, excluding any Shares
issuable pursuant to Section 1.5) have been validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn; provided that Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably waive (A) the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_  and agree not to assert such
conditions as a basis for not consummating the Offer, and (B) the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i), (iii) and (iv).
Subject to the terms and the conditions of the Offer and this  



 

2  Agreement, as soon as practicable after expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall accept for payment and pay for, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
accept for payment and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may in its
sole discretion elect to provide for a subsequent offering period pursuant to,
and on the terms required by, Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange Act_ ").

(c) At the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer until such date as the conditions set forth in
_Annex A_ have been satisfied; provided that such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied before the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Merger Sub to
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC with respect to the Offer a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") which will on the date filed with the
SEC and the date first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and any other applicable U.S. federal
securities laws, and will contain the offer to purchase relating to the Offer
and form of the related letter of transmittal (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto and including the exhibits
thereto, are referred to herein collectively as the " _Offer Documents_ "), 
_provided,_ _however_ , that no representation, warranty or covenant hereby is
made or will be made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in, or information derived from the
Companys public SEC filings which is incorporated by reference or included
in the Offer Documents. Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the U.S.
federal securities laws. Parent shall deliver copies of the proposed forms of
the Offer Documents to the Company and its counsel in advance of filing with
the SEC and the commencement of the Offer and shall provide a reasonable
opportunity for review and comment by the Company and its counsel. The Offer
Documents shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
amendments and supplements to the initial Offer Documents prior to
their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Companys stockholders.
Parent shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel any comments,
written or oral, that Merger Sub, Parent or their counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt
of any such comments, and provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in preparation of responses to SEC comments. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable U. S. federal securities laws.

(e) Parent hereby guarantees the full and timely performance of all of Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement and shall provide or cause to be
provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to accept for
payment, and pay for, any Shares and Company Warrants that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

1.2 _Company Action_.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that
the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held and acting upon a
unanimous recommendation of a  



 

3  special committee of the Company Board comprised entirely of independent
directors (the " _Transaction Committee_ "), has (i) declared
the advisability of the Merger and this Agreement, (ii) approved the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) determined that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Companys stockholders, and (iv) subject to
Section 7.4(d), resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept
the Offer and tender their Shares to Merger Sub and, if required, approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendations of the
Company Board described in this Section 1.2(a).

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC on the date of the commencement of the
Offer a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") which will on the date filed with
the SEC and the date first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and any other applicable
U.S. federal securities laws, and that, subject to Section 7.4(d), will
contain the recommendations of the Company Board referred to in subsection
(a) above, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the Companys
stockholders as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the
Schedule 14D-9 to Parent and its counsel in advance of the filing with the SEC
and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for review and comment by Parent
and its counsel. The Schedule 14D-9 shall be in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendments and supplements to the Schedule 14D-9
prior to their filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Companys
stockholders. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel any comments
that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of any such comments.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause such Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws.

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent or agents to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the
latest practicable date and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders,
security position listings and computer files and all other information in
the Companys possession or control, to the extent reasonably available to
the Company, regarding the beneficial owners of Shares and any securities
convertible into Shares, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, and _except_ for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, will, upon
request, deliver, and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their agents to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information then
in their possession or control.

1.3 _Directors; Section 14(f)_. 

(a) Effective upon Merger Subs purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to
the next whole number, for election  



 

4  or appointment to the Company Board as will give Parent representation on
the Company Board equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the increase in the size of such board
pursuant to this Section 1.3), and (ii) a fraction equal to the number of
Shares beneficially owned by Merger Sub and Parent (including Shares so
accepted for payment) divided by the number of Shares then outstanding. In
furtherance thereof, upon request of Parent, the Company shall take all action
reasonably requested by Parent to cause such designees of Parent and Merger
Sub to be so elected or appointed at such time, including increasing the size
of the board and seeking resignations of incumbent directors. At such time,
the Company shall, if reasonably requested by Parent, cause persons designated
by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board other than the Transaction Committee, and (ii) each board of directors
of each subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof), in each case
only to the extent permitted by the rules of The American Stock Exchange ("
_AMEX_ ") and U.S. federal securities laws.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to the Company and its officers and directors and Parents designees, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have provided to
the Company on a timely basis the information with respect to Parent and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that, if Parents designees are elected to the
Company Board, such board of directors shall have, at all times prior to the
Effective Time, at least two directors who are directors on the date of this
Agreement and who are not officers, employees or affiliates of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries (it being understood that for
purposes of this sentence, a director of the Company or Parent shall not be
deemed an affiliate of the Company solely as a result of his or her status as
a director of the Company or Parent) and who are "independent directors" as
defined in the rules of the AMEX (the " _Independent Directors_ "), (ii) if
the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director may designate a person to fill
such vacancy who is not an officer, employee or affiliate of the Company,
Parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries and such person shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii)
if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors may designate two
persons to fill such vacancies who shall not be officers, employees or
affiliates of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during the
period after election of directors designated by Parent pursuant to
this Section 1.3 but prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
delegate to a committee of the Company Board comprised solely of the
Independent Directors (which may be the Transaction Committee) (the "
_Independent Committee_ ") the sole responsibility for (i) any amendment or
any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension of time
for performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement for which the Companys consent or approval is required, (iii)
the exercise or waiver of any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder,
(iv) any amendment to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws,
and (v) any waiver of compliance with any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub or
any condition to any obligation of the Company or of any of the Companys
rights under this Agreement. Any action of the Independent Committee with
respect to the above matters in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to
constitute the action of the full Company Board to approve the actions
contemplated  



 

5  hereby and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action
by any other director of the Company, shall be required for such
authorization. The Independent Committee shall have the authority to retain
one separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Company.

1.4  _Adjustment to Offer Price_. If, following the date of this Agreement,
the Company changes or establishes a record date for changing the number of
Shares outstanding as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination or other similar
transaction in respect of the outstanding Shares and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, then, in any such event, and in addition
to any other rights and remedies that may be available to it, the Offer Price
shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect that change.

1.5 _Top-Up Option_ __.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Company hereby grants to
Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price, up to that number of shares of the
Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the
lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock collectively owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any of
their respective Affiliates immediately following consummation of the Offer
shall constitute 90% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and (ii) an
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to 19.9% of the
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 1.5(a), the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if the
aggregate number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, plus
the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of Common Stock, plus the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all
options and other rights to purchase Common Stock, plus the aggregate number
of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plans would exceed the number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

(b) Parent may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole,
but not in part, at any one time prior to Top-Up Termination Date, _provided_
, _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exerciseable unless,
immediately after such exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares,
the Short Form Merger Threshold would be reached (assuming the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares).

(c) If Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall send to the
Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ", and the date of
receipt of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ")
specifying the place for the closing of the purchase and sale of shares of
Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ") and a
date not earlier than one (1) Business Day nor later than ten (10) Business
Days after the Top-Up Notice Date for the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice
to Parent confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor.

(d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
or certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares,
_provided_ _that_ the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option
Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that
no provision of any applicable law or any ruling, judgment, decision, order
or injunction issued by any Court or other Government Entity shall prohibit
the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares
in respect of any such exercise and (ii) Parent shall purchase each Top-Up
Option Share from the Company at the  



 

6  Offer Price. Payment by Parent of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option
Shares may be made, at Parents option, by delivery of (A)
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company or (B) a demand note issued by Parent in customary form that is
reasonably acceptable to the parties and in a principal face amount equal to
the aggregate amount of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Top-Up
Option Shares. Any demand note issued pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
be accompanied by a credit support arrangement reasonably acceptable to the
parties hereto.

(e) Upon the delivery by Parent to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice,
and the delivery of the consideration described in Section 1.5(d), Parent
shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares
issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of
the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-
Up Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Parent or the
Company shall have failed or refused to designate the bank account described
in Section 1.5(d).

(f) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
include legends legally required including a legend in substantially the
following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR SOLD ONLY
IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.

8 ARTICLE 4

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES

4.1 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, or any holder of any stock or other equity ownership interest of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _except_
as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1 and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. All such Shares, when so
converted, no longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate evidencing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, _except_ the right to receive the Offer Price per share
therefor, without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax, upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 4.2.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent or the Company, if any, immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one
share of common stock of Surviving Corporation.

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Merger Consideration_.

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company SOSARs and Company Warrants,
the cash required to make payments in respect of the Merger consideration as
required by this Article 4 (such cash, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the cash payments contemplated to be issued pursuant
to Section 4.1 and 4.4 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not
be used for any other purpose.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "), and whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price pursuant to Section 4.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Offer Price. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and
such other documents as the Exchange Agent shall reasonably require, the
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Offer Price for each Share formerly evidenced thereby, in accordance with
Section 4.1(a), and the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled.
Until surrendered as provided in this Section 4.2(b), each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Offer Price for each Share evidenced thereby.
No interest will be paid or accrue on any amounts payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.



 

9 (c) All Merger consideration paid upon exchange of the Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Shares so exchanged.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 4 will thereafter look only to Parent for the
Merger consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Government Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any of the Merger consideration would otherwise escheat or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect thereof
shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest on any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be. Any amounts deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the appropriate Governmental Entity on a timely basis.

(g) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
consideration payable with respect to the Shares evidenced by such
Certificate.

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 4.2(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand.

4.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
except for the right to receive the Offer Price pursuant to Section 4.1,
without interest. All cash paid upon the surrender of the Certificates in
accordance with this Article 4 shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly evidenced by
such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Offer Price in
accordance with this Article 4.



 

10 4.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares; Company
Warrants; Company SOSARs; and Stock Purchase Plan_.

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate, subject to
prior review and reasonable approval of Parent, to provide that each
outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted
under any stock option plan, program or agreement to which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is a party (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to the right to receive an amount in cash
payable at the time of cancellation of such Company Stock Option equal to the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Offer Price over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option. Such cash payment shall
be subject to and reduced by all applicable Taxes to be withheld in respect of
such payment. The surrender of a Company Stock Option in exchange for the
consideration contemplated by this Section 4.4(a) shall be deemed a release of
any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect thereof.

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, on the
Expiration Date (provided that, on such Expiration Date, Merger Sub accepts
for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer), (i) the Company Stock Option Plans and any similar plan or agreement
of the Company shall be terminated, and (ii) no holder of any Company Stock
Option will have any right to receive any shares of capital stock of
the Company or, if applicable, the Surviving Corporation, upon exercise of
any Company Stock Option. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
from extending the termination date of one or more issued and outstanding
Company Stock Options, but in no event later than December 31, 2007.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that all outstanding Company Restricted
Shares shall automatically become fully vested and free of any forfeiture
restrictions on the Expiration Date (provided that, on such Expiration Date,
Merger Sub accepts for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer), and the Company will take all necessary action,
including obtaining any required consents or amendments to the Companys
equity incentive plan, to permit holders of outstanding Company Restricted
Shares to participate in the Offer and be treated in the Merger on the same
terms and conditions as all other holders of unrestricted Shares.

(d) The Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate, subject to
prior review and reasonable approval of Parent, to provide that each
outstanding Company SOSAR granted under any Company Stock Option Plan, program
or agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to the right to receive an amount in cash
payable at the time of cancellation of such Company SOSAR equal to the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Offer Price over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Company SOSAR multiplied by (B) the number of
Company SOSARs held by the holder thereof. Such cash payment shall be subject
to and reduced by all Taxes to be withheld in respect of such payment. The
surrender of a Company SOSAR in exchange for the consideration contemplated by
this Section 4.4(d) shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect thereof.

(e) Pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will take such actions
(including obtaining any required consents) as may be required to provide that
each of the Company Warrants will, as of the Effective  



 

11  Time, be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount equal to the
product of (i) the Offer Price minus the per share exercise price under such
Company Warrant, and (ii) the number of Shares issuable pursuant to such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary that no new contributions shall be
accepted by, or made to, the Companys Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Stock Purchase Plan_ "), and any cash remaining in participants accounts
after the date such action is taken will be distributed to participants, and
the Stock Purchase Plan shall be terminated effective as of the Effective
Time. On or after the date hereof, no future offering periods under the Stock
Purchase Plan shall be commenced, and no further options will be granted under
the Stock Purchase Plan.

4.5 _Treatment of the Convertible Instruments_. Pursuant to the Tender and
Voting Agreement, each holder of the Convertible Instruments has agreed to (i)
convert or exercise, as applicable, effective as of the Expiration Date
(provided that, on such Expiration Date, Merger Sub accepts for payment all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer), all
Convertible Instruments held by such holder (other than Company Warrants,
which such warrants shall be converted for cash as set forth in Section
4.4(e)), and (ii) tender their Shares (including the Shares acquired upon
conversion or exercise of the Convertible Instruments) in the Offer. Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that all such Shares shall participate in the
Offer and be treated in the Merger on the same terms and conditions as all
other holders of Shares. For purposes of calculating the Minimum Condition and
for all other purposes under this Agreement, the Shares subject to the
Convertible Instruments shall all be deemed to be Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

4.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance
with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
relevant Merger consideration. The holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL, unless such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, in
which case such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the relevant Merger
Consideration, as set forth in Section 4.2, without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares and withdrawals of such demands, any other
instruments or documents served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company with respect to such demands, and the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to
payment for such Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL will receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation and as of the
Effective Time such Shares will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist.

that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had a Material Adverse Effect), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub:

5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. The Company is qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the assets and
properties owned, leased and operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it, makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not have, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. True, accurate and
complete copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, in
each case as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto,
have heretofore been delivered to Parent. The Company is not in violation of
any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents, except for such violations that would not
have and would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares, of which 65,000,000 shares are designated Common Stock and 35,000,000
of which are designated Preferred Stock, par value $0.02 per share, of which
12,000,000 are designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (" _Series A
Preferred Stock_ ") and 13,500,000 are designated as Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock (" _Series B Preferred Stock_ "). As of December 31, 2006,
16,848,811 Shares, 6,726,457 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 10,571,427
shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and no Shares
or shares of Preferred Stock were held in treasury. All of such issued and
outstanding shares are duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. No issued and outstanding shares of the Company capital stock
are subject to a repurchase or redemption right or right of first refusal or
condition of forfeiture in favor of the Company.

(b) Except pursuant to Section 1.5, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, contracts, commitments, restrictions, stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock, rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or
exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or other agreement and
also including any rights plan or other anti-takeover agreement, obligating
the Company to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of the Company capital stock. There are no voting
trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings to which the Company is
a party or is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of the Company
capital stock. Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the number of Shares issuable upon conversion of the Company Preferred Stock,
as well as pursuant to (i) exercise of options to purchase Shares granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans and outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement as identified on Section 5.2(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (ii) exercise of outstanding common stock purchase warrants as

Convertible Notes as identified on Section 5.2(b)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Convertible Notes_ "), (iv) outstanding
restricted stock awards as identified on Section 5.2(b)(iv) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") and (v) the
exercise of stock-only stock appreciation rights (the " _Company SOSARs_ ")
issued under the Company Stock Option Plans as identified in Section 5.2(b)(v)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company Stock Options, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Warrants, Company Convertible Notes, Company
Restricted Shares and Company SOSARs are collectively referred to as "
_Company Stock-Based Securities_ ". All of the Companys Stock-Based
Securities have been issued by the Company in compliance in all material
respects with applicable laws, including applicable U.S. federal securities
laws and all Company Stock Options were granted with a per share exercise
price equal to the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant.

(c) Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all holders of outstanding Company Stock-Based
Securities, indicating with respect to each of the Company Stock-Based
Securities, (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock-Based
Securities (whether by exercise, conversion or vesting), held by each such
holder, and (ii) the exercise or conversion price, date of issuance or grant
and expiration date, if any, of such Company Stock-Based Securities. The
Company has made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of all
Company agreements evidencing Company Stock-Based Securities (and all relevant
Company Plans).

(d) There are (i) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Company having the right to vote issued or outstanding, and (ii) no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the Company capital
stock or any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company.

(e) Other than dividends with respect to the Company Preferred Stock pursuant
to the Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Board has not declared any
dividend or distribution with respect to any shares of the Company capital
stock or any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company, the
record or payment date for which is on or after the date of this Agreement.

5.3  _Subsidiaries_.

(a) For each Subsidiary of the Company, Section 5.3(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, and each jurisdiction such Subsidiary is qualified to do
business.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, and has all corporate powers, _except_ where failure to be so
incorporated, validly existing or in good standing, or to have such corporate
powers would not have, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, _except_ for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not
have, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
Each Subsidiary of the Company is in compliance with the provisions of its
organizational or governing documents, _except_ where the failure to be in
compliance with such documents would not have, and would not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Other than its Subsidiaries,
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries beneficially owns or controls,
directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of equity or similar
securities of any corporation or other entity whether incorporated or
unincorporated.



 

14 (c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other voting
securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien other than any
restrictions imposed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "). Other than the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other voting securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the
Company that is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or
more Subsidiaries, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or
other voting securities or ownership interests in any of the Companys
Subsidiaries, (ii) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting

or defaults which would not have, and would not be reasonably likely to have,

necessary to approve the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders Approval_ ").

5.5 _SEC Matters_.

(a) The Company has timely filed all forms, reports and other documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2004
(collectively, the " _Company Reports_ "). As of their respective dates (or,
if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date so amended, supplemented or superseded), the Company
Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in the Company Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders equity included in the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, _except_ , as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited statements, for
normal year-end audit adjustments. The principal executive officer of the
Company and the principal financial officer of the Company (and each former
principal executive officer or principal financial officer of the Company)
have made the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company
Reports that were required to be accompanied by such certifications. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and
"principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(b) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the Company Reports
is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents and such internal controls over financial reporting are effective
to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and the Company
Board regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

(c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company has been and is
in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations
of the AMEX.



 

16 (d) The Company has received no written notice of any investigation by the SEC
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, no investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is pending or threatened.

5.6 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company did not have at December
31, 2005, nor has it incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature required by
GAAP to be set forth in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or in the
notes thereto, except (i) to the extent such liabilities or obligations are
disclosed in the SEC Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, (ii)
such liabilities that have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date
hereof, (iii) liabilities and obligations disclosed in Section 5.6 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iv) such liabilities or obligations that
were incurred after December 31, 2005 in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practices that would not have, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

5.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the SEC
Reports or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, since December
31, 2005 through the date hereof, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action or
agreed to take any action that would be prohibited by any of Sections 7.2(a),
(b), (c)(i), (c)(iii), c(v), (d), (e), (g) and (k) if taken after the date
hereof; (iii) the Company has not increased the compensation for
substantially all or a material portion of its employees, except for its
annual salary adjustments as of April 1, 2006; (iv) except as required by law
or as is consistent with past practice, the Company has not made or changed
any Tax election or entered into any closing agreement in respect of any Tax
claim, audit or assessment, including the settlement of any Tax controversy,
adoption or change of any accounting method in respect of Taxes, consented to
any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes (other than in connection with the timely
filing of any Tax Return by its extended due date or any extension or waiver
that ended on or before December 31, 2006 and which is not currently in
effect) if such election, agreement, adoption, change, consent or waiver would
have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any material respect for any period ending after the Closing
Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company and its Subsidiaries
existing on the Closing Date in any material respect; and (v) there has not
been an event, occurrence, effect or circumstance that has had, or that would
be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

5.8 _Litigation_. There are no (i) claims, suits, actions, proceedings,
hearings, petitions, grievances, complaints or investigations pending against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims, suits, actions, proceedings, hearings, petitions,
grievances, complaints or investigations against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case which would have, or would be reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
authority, or any arbitrator, which would have, or would be reasonably likely
to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
for all purposes of the Agreement, no party makes any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of the antitrust laws on such partys ability
to execute, deliver, or perform its obligations under the Agreement or to
consummate the Merger as a result of the enactment, promulgation, application,
or threatened or actual judicial or administrative investigation or
litigation under, or enforcement of, any antitrust law with respect to the
consummation of the Merger.



 

17 5.9 _No Violation of Law_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of or has been given notice or been charged with any violation
of, any law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment of any
Governmental Entity, except for violations that would not have, and would not
be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

5.10 _Permits_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses,
approvals, and authorizations (collectively, " _Permits_ ") of all
Governmental Entities required by the Company and its Subsidiaries to own and
operate their respective assets and carry on their respective businesses as
currently conducted, except where the failure to obtain, have and maintain
such Permits, or the suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits, would
not have, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.11 _Compliance with Agreements_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach or violation of, or in default in the performance
or observance of, any term or provision of, and no event has occurred which,
with lapse of time or action by a third party, would result in a default
under, any Material Contract except for such breach, violation, default or
event that would not have, and would not be reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect, and the Company has not received any written notice
of any such breach, violation, default or event. To the knowledge of the
Company, there exists no breach, violation or default in performance or
obligation by any other party to any Material Contract, except for such
breach, violation or default that would not have, and would not be reasonably
likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

5.12 _Taxes_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have (i) duly filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all material Tax Returns required to be filed, and such
filed Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects,
(ii) duly paid in full or made adequate provision for the payment of all
Taxes for all periods at or prior to the date hereof, and (iii) duly withheld
and paid all Taxes required by applicable law to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, or other third party. No material written claim has ever
been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction. The liabilities and reserves for Taxes
reflected in the balance sheet included in the SEC Reports are adequate to
cover all material Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods
ending at or prior to the date of such balance sheet and there are no
material Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of either of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, _except_ for Liens for Taxes not yet due. Except
as set forth in Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no audit or
administrative or judicial Tax proceeding is pending or being conducted with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any written notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review, a request for information related to Tax matters, or
notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed,
asserted or assessed. The Company has delivered to Parent correct and complete
copies of all federal income Tax Returns filed for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and for
all other open years. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of a material amount of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to an assessment or deficiency
for a material amount of Taxes (other than pursuant to extensions of time to
file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any request for a ruling in respect of Taxes
pending before any Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which is
the Company) or has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than the
Company or any Subsidiary) under Treasury regulation section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a  



 

18  transferee, successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has been either a "distributing corporation" or
a "controlled corporation" in a distribution occurring during the last five
years in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution as
one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is required to make any disclosure to the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to a "listed transaction" pursuant to Treasury
Regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any agreement,
contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or is reasonably likely
to result, whether as a result of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, separately or in the aggregate, in (i) any
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G, or (ii)
any amount that will not be fully deductible as a result of Code Section
162(m).

(c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any indemnification,
allocation or sharing agreement with respect to Taxes that could give rise to
a material payment or indemnification obligation (other than (i) agreements
among the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) customary Tax indemnifications
contained in credit or other commercial lending agreements, (iii) customary
Tax sharing provisions related to sales and use taxes or personal property
taxes included in the ordinary course of business in Government Contracts and
(iv) customary Tax sharing provisions contained in leases).

5.13 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

(a) Section 5.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) each plan,
program, arrangement, practice and policy under which one, or more than one,
current or former officer, employee or director of the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company has any right to employment, to purchase or receive any stock
or other securities of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or to
receive any compensation (whether in the form of cash or stock or otherwise)
or benefits of any kind or description whatsoever in any amount or under which
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has or may have any liability, and
(ii) each employee benefit plan within the meaning set forth in Section 3(3)
of ERISA under which the Company or a Subsidiary has or may have any liability

Disclosure Schedule identifies the Company Plans pursuant to which the
Company Stock Options may be granted.

(b) The Company has delivered to Parent (i) a current, complete and accurate
copy of each Company Plan and a summary plan description which are set forth
in writing (and any related trust, actuarial report, financial statement,
insurance contract or other funding arrangement) and a written summary of
each Company Plan which is not set forth in writing, and (ii) a copy of the
three (3) most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500) and all related exhibits and
reports for each Company Plan which is subject to ERISA. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has any plan or commitment to establish any new material
Company Plan or to materially alter any Company Plan.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
sponsored, established, participated in or contributed to, any (i) plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (ii)
a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 414(f) of the Code or a
plan described in Section 413(c) of the Code (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ").
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liability
under Title IV of ERISA.

(d) There have been no prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section
406 or Section 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect to any
of the Company Plans that could result in material penalties, taxes,
liabilities or indemnification obligations, and there has been no other event
with respect to any Company Plan that could result in any material liability
for the Company or any Subsidiary related to any excise Taxes under the Code
or to any liabilities under ERISA.



 

19 (e) Each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, has pending an application for such a determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service or is entitled to rely on a prototype
plan opinion letter, and the Company is not aware of any reason likely to
result in the revocation of any such letter or in the Internal Revenue Service
declining to issue a favorable determination letter on a pending application.
The Company has provided to Parent a copy of the most recent Internal Revenue
Service favorable determination or opinion letter with respect to each such
Company Plan or a copy of the application to the Internal Revenue Service, as
applicable.

(f) Each Company Plan has been established, maintained and administered in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code.

(g) The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not (either alone or together with any other event,
including, any termination of employment) entitle any current or former
officer, employee, director or other independent contractor of the Company or
a Subsidiary to any change in control payment or benefit, transaction bonus or
similar benefit or severance pay, result in the forgiveness of indebtedness,
or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Company Plan.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability in respect of
post-termination or post-retirement health, medical or life insurance
benefits for any current or former officer, employee, director or independent
contractor except as required to avoid excise Tax under Section 4980B of the
Code.

(i) All contributions and other payment due from the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to each Company Plan and each Company union plan have been made
or paid in full or are shown in the SEC Reports, and all of the assets which
have been set aside in a trust, escrow account or insurance company separate
account to satisfy any obligations under any Company Plan are shown on the
books and records of each such trust or account at their current fair
market value as of the most recent valuation date for such trust or account,
and the fair market value of all such assets as of each such valuation date
equals or exceeds the present value of any obligation under any Company Plan.
If the Company (and all ERISA Affiliates) were to have a cessation of
contributions, cessation of obligations to make contribution or other form of
withdrawal from any Company Plan that is a Multiemployer Plans, it (and they)
would incur no liabilities with respect to any such Company Plan under the
terms of such Company Plans, any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims with respect to a Company Plan (other than routine and reasonable
claims for benefits made in the ordinary course of the plans operations) or
with respect to the terms and conditions of employment or termination of
employment of any current or former officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary, which claims could be reasonably
likely to result in any material liability to the Company or a
Subsidiary, and no audit by any domestic or foreign governmental or other law
enforcement agency is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been
proposed with respect to any Company Plan.



 

20 (k) Each Person who performs, or has performed, services for the Company or a
Subsidiary as an employee or as an independent contractor is, or has been,
properly classified as an employee or as an independent contractor, _except_
where failure to properly classify such Person(s) would not have, and would
not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

(l) Vesting for options which are outstanding under Company Stock Option
Plans, including accelerated vesting which will occur at the Effective Time,
has been effected in accordance with the terms of the plans and with all
applicable laws, and the interests in or shares available for issuance under
each such Company Stock Option Plan are properly registered pursuant to the
Securities Act on a Form S-8.

(m) No current or former officer or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is entitled to receive severance payments or severance benefits
under more than one Company Plan. Section 5.13(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all severance plans or policies maintained by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

(n) No Company Plan provides, or provided, to any "service provider" (within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) any compensation or benefits which
could subject, or have subjected, such service provider to gross income
inclusion or tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

5.14 _Labor; Employment Matters_.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is, nor at any time
in the last five (5) years has been, a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or other contract or agreement with any group of employees, labor
organization or other representative of any of the employees of the Company
or any Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
organizational efforts presently being made involving any of the employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the Companys knowledge, no executive or
key employee or group of employees of the Company has any plan to terminate
his or her employment with the Company or has threatened to do so. No work
stoppage, slowdown or labor strike against the Company or any Subsidiary is
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no direct or indirect liability with respect to any
misclassification of any Persons as an independent contractor rather than as
an employee, _except_ where such liability would not have, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with all laws relating to employment and labor,
including, any provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, collective
bargaining and the payment of social security and similar Taxes. No person has
asserted that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any arrears
of wages or any Taxes or penalties for failure to comply with any of such
laws.

(b) Section 5.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries showing for each the
employees name, job title or description, salary level (including any bonus
or deferred compensation arrangements other than arrangements under which

commission or other remuneration other than salary paid during the Companys
last fiscal year. Except as set forth on Section 5.14(b) of the Company

as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Section 5.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the address
of all real property in which the Company or any Subsidiary holds a leasehold
or subleasehold estate (the " _Leased Real Property_ ", and the leases or
subleases for such Leased Real Property being referred to as the " _Leases_
"). The Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of each of
the Leases. Each Lease creates a valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real
Property to which it applies and is in full force and effect in all respects
and the Company or any Subsidiary is entitled to the benefit of such Lease in
accordance with its terms, with such exceptions as are not material and do not
interfere with the use of the such premises. Such leasehold interests are
free and clear of all Liens, except (i) Liens for current taxes and
assessments not yet due, (ii) inchoate mechanics and materialmens Liens for
construction in progress, (iii) workmens, repairmens, warehousemens and
carriers Liens arising in the ordinary course of business of the Company or
any Subsidiary consistent with past practice, and (iv) all Liens and
other imperfections of title (including matters of record) and encumbrances
that do not materially interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or as have not had, or would
not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys
knowledge, no event has occurred which either entitles, or would, on notice or
lapse of time or both, entitle any other party to any Lease to terminate such
Lease prior to its scheduled term. Section 5.15(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth any consents, waivers or other approvals required to be
obtained by the Company as a result of the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger so that the Leases will continue in accordance with their terms
following the Merger.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in
compliance with all Environmental Laws, including having all Permits, licenses
and other approvals and authorizations necessary for the operation of their
businesses as presently conducted, _except_ for violations that would not
have, or would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. In
the past (5) years, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any
written notices, demand letters or written requests for information from any
Governmental Entity indicating that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
be in material violation of, or liable in any material respect under, any
Environmental Law. The Company has not received any written notice of any
civil, criminal or administrative Action against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to any material violation of or liability in any
material respect under, or alleged material violation of or liability in any
material respect under, any Environmental Law, and to the Companys knowledge
there are no, and have not been any, civil, criminal or administrative Action
pending or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to any violation of or liability under, or alleged violation of or liability
under, any Environmental Law. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has disposed of Hazardous Substances at a location that requires remediation
under Environmental Laws, _except_ for disposals that would not have, and
would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. There
has been no Release of Hazardous Substances at any property currently
operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor has there been a Release of
Hazardous Substances at any property formerly owned or operated by the Company
or its Subsidiaries during the period of such ownership or operation,
_except_ for releases that would not have, and would not be reasonably likely
to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

study, audit, test, review or other analysis conducted by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in relation to the current or prior
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or

Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in
Section 7.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent that the requirement
of such consent would, upon advice of counsel, violate applicable law.

7.4 _No Solicitation by Company_.

(a) Subject to Sections 7.4(c), 7.4(d) and 7.4(e), during the term of this
Agreement the Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not, and its
or its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents or retained
representatives (each, a " _Company Representative_ ") will not, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
making, submission, or reaffirmation by any Person (other than Parent and its

constitutes, or would be reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or
provide access to its properties, books and records or any confidential
information or data to, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) enter into any agreement, understanding, letter of intent or
arrangement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take the necessary steps promptly to inform
each Company Representative of the obligations undertaken in this Section
7.4. Subject to Section 7.4(d), neither the  



 

35  Company nor the Company Board or any committee thereof shall recommend to
its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal or approve any agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall take, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
Company Representatives to immediately cease any discussions or negotiations
with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided,_ _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.4 shall preclude the
Company or any Company Representative from contacting any such party or
parties solely for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the last
sentence of this Section 7.4(a). The Company shall immediately cease and shall
instruct the Company Representatives to terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, if any, to return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours after the Companys receipt) of any Acquisition
Proposal, including the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal, which the
Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives receives after the date hereof, and shall keep Parent informed
on a prompt basis as to the status of and any material developments regarding
any such proposal. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement
that would prohibit them from providing such information to Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.4(a), at any time prior to the acceptance for
payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, following the receipt by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that prior to such action (i)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal and financial advisors, that such action is necessary in
order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal (and in making this determination, the
Company Board, directly or through the Company Representatives, may contact
such Person and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying the
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof and
the conditions to and likelihood of consummation, so as to enable the Company
Board to determine whether such proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal), and (ii) the Company shall have informed
Parent promptly following any such action (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours after the Companys receipt), the Company may (directly or
through the Company Representatives) (A) enter into a confidentiality
agreement on substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement,
(B) subject to such confidentiality agreement, furnish non-public information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person who made such
proposal (provided that the Company has previously furnished or concurrently
furnishes such information to Parent), and (C) participate in negotiations
regarding such proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 7.4(a), if, at any time prior to the acceptance
for payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
did not otherwise result from a breach of the terms of the first or third
sentence of Section 7.4(a) or a material breach of the terms of the second,
fourth or fifth sentence of Section 7.4(a), that such proposal is a Superior
Proposal and/or recommending such Superior Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company is necessary in order for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may terminate this
Agreement and/or its Board of Directors may approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal to its stockholders, and immediately prior to or concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement enter into any agreement, understanding,
letter of intent or arrangement with respect to such Superior Proposal, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the  



 

36  Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence, and
any purported termination pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless concurrently with such termination pursuant to this
Section 7.4(d) the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant
to Section 9.3(a) and _provided_ , _further_ , however, that the Company shall
not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement and the Company Board
shall not recommend a Superior Proposal to its stockholders pursuant to this
Section 7.4(d) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that the Company or its Board of Directors
intends to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, specifying in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal,
this notice to be delivered not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the time the action is taken, and, during this three (3) Business Day period,
the Company and its advisors shall negotiate in good faith with Parent to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4 to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company
Board, at any time prior to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer,
from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders required to be made by
applicable statute, law, rule or regulation in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any required
disclosure to stockholders with regard to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
making a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 7.4(d).

(f) If at any time prior to the expiration of the Offer or the Effective Time,
as the case may be, any event with respect to Parent (including its officers,
directors and Subsidiaries) shall occur that is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the
Proxy Statement or the other documents required to be filed by Parent or the
Company in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall notify the Company thereof and
such event shall be so described. Any such amendment or supplement shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, as and to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, and such amendment or
supplement shall comply in all material respects with all provisions of
applicable law. 

7.5 _Regulatory_.

(a) Without limiting Section 7.3, the parties will cooperate with each other
and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare
and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger, the Offer
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent will
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each
will consult the other on, in each case, subject to applicable law relating to
the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties will consult with each other with respect to
obtaining all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

37 (b) Each of Parent and the Company will, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the
Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by
or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity and any
material communication given or received in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.6 _Recommendation of the Company Board; Company Stockholder Approval;
Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

(a) If the Company Stockholders Approval is required by law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as promptly as practicable
following the consummation of the Offer duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of obtaining such approval. The record date for determining
eligibility to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be after the
date on which Merger Sub shall have purchased and paid for, and been
recognized by the Company as the record owner of, the Shares duly tendered
in, and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of, the Offer. Subject to the
duties of the Company Board under applicable law, the Company shall, through
its board of directors, advise the Merger, recommend to its stockholders that
the Company Stockholders Approval be given and will take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholders Approval.
The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Parent and Merger Sub in the aggregate shall acquire 90% or more of the then
outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties shall take
all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the Merger, pursuant to the
terms thereof, to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after
such acquisition without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and
otherwise in accordance with the DGCL.

(b) If the Company Stockholders Approval is required by law to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the expiration of
the Offer, prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after
responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the staff. If at any
time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event
that, in the judgment of the Company Board after consultation with its legal
counsel, should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto
and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish the other Parties
with all information required to be included therein with respect to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall not use any proxy material
(including, without limitation, the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting
without prior consultation with Parent which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



 

38 (c) Parent agrees to cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all
other Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub to be voted in favor of the
Merger.

(d) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that none of the information
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. No covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein. Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that none
of the information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliate of Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time
of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No covenant is made
by either Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company
in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
shall correct promptly any information provided by it to be used
specifically in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps necessary
to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case to the extent required by applicable law.

7.7 _Agreement to Cooperate; HSR Filings_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate and assist the Company, to obtain all consents of any
third parties that may be necessary for the consummation of the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
consents from any Governmental Entities which are addressed in Section
7.7(c)).

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company undertake and
agree to file as soon as practicable (and in any event not later than ten (10)
days after the date hereof), if required by law, a Notification and Report
Form under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ").

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 7.7(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any request by the FTC or DOJ for additional information and  



 

39  documents or any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) permit the other
party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other
in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such
other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ
or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences, provided however, that the parties may comply with this
subsection (c)(iii) by designating that certain sensitive information shall
only be shared with the respective parties outside legal counsel, and (iv)
promptly take reasonable actions to respond to inquiries from the FTC, DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity regarding the legality under any antitrust law
of the Merger; _provided,_   _however_ , that all obligations in this Section
7.7(c) shall be subject to applicable laws relating to exchange of information
and attorney-client communication and privileges.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company undertake to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided,_ _however_ , that
neither party is required to contest or appeal any such order issued by a
United States Court of Appeals.

(e) Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, confirmation from the
applicable Governmental Entities that they will not recommend that the
Companys security clearances be revoked, suspended or downgraded as a result
of the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall and shall cause its
employees to make all filings or notifications or such other actions as are
necessary or appropriate in order to prevent the security clearances of the
Company and their respective employees from being revoked, suspended or
downgraded.

7.8 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable law relating to the
exchange of information, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records (which the parties agree may be
afforded in whole or in part through electronic means). During such period,
the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities laws or federal or state laws applicable to such party
(other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to disclose
under applicable law), (ii) within twenty-five (25) days of the end of each
month following the date hereof, an unaudited monthly consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the month then ended and related
consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity, and
(ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as Parent and its representatives may reasonably request.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent nor any of
their Subsidiaries will be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene  



 

40  any law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in
the ordinary course of business. The parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule
14D-9 or the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC and/or mailing to the stockholders of the Company of such
amendment or supplement, in each case as promptly as practicable.

(c) All information provided to Parent and its representatives pursuant to
this Section 7.8 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until
Closing and, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 9, such
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in accordance with its terms.

7.9 _Expenses and Fees_. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated; provided that any fee for any filing under the HSR Act will
be paid by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent
shall pay or cause the Company to pay, on the date that Merger Sub purchases
the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer, the Companys legal fees
and expenses related to the actions or transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and incurred prior to the Closing Date, the investment banking and
advisory fees of the Company Financial Advisor and Raymond James and
Associates, Inc., the transaction bonuses described on the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and the diligence data site hosting fees, accounting fees, printing
fees and filing fees incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

7.10 _Public Statements_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
issued or made by any party without the prior consent of the other party or
parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (i) as such release or announcement may be required by law or
the rules or regulations of the any applicable United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other party or parties reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and (ii) that
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their respective Affiliates may
make such an announcement to their respective employees, customers and
suppliers, after consultation with the other parties.

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year after the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide each Company Employee as of the Effective Time with employee benefits
and compensation plans, programs and arrangements (other than awards of
equity-based compensation but including other forms of cash incentive
compensation) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to, at the
discretion of Parent, either (i) the employee benefits and compensation plans,
programs and arrangements provided to the most directly similarly situated
employee of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Plans_ ") or (ii) those
provided such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the Company Plans listed on Schedule 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
From the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each Company Employee who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
compensation and benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
 



 

41  collective bargaining agreement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a
guarantee of employment for any Company Employee, or to restrict the right of
the Surviving Corporation to terminate any Employee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Parent Plan or Company
Plan, or (ii) shall limit the right of the Parent, Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent
Plan or Company Plan following the Effective Time. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section
7.11 with respect to Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express
or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in
any other Person, including, without limitation, any Company Employees, former
Company Employees, any participant in any Parent Plan or Company Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates or
continued participation in any Parent Plan or Company Plan.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to receive credit
for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Stock Option Plans and
Company Plans set forth on Schedule 7.11(c), as applicable, will occur at or
prior to the Effective Time, as applicable. 

(d) The Company shall not communicate in writing to groups of Company
employees and/or Company retirees, regarding any matters discussed in this
Section 7.11 without the consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and to be rendered promptly. The
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers and
the members of the Company Board not to make any formal, oral communications
to groups of Company employees and/or Company retirees that are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Section 7.11.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary so that no new contributions shall
be accepted by, or made to, the Stock Purchase Plan and any cash remaining in
participants accounts after the date such action is taken will be distributed
to participants. The Company shall terminate the Stock Purchase Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. On and after the date hereof, no
future offering periods will be commenced or options will be granted under the
Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to matters described in this Section
7.11(e), any material notices or other communication materials provided to
the Stock Purchase Plans participants shall be subject to prior review and
approval of Parent.

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters; Supplemental Disclosure_.

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to give prompt notice
to each other of, and to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to prevent or promptly remedy, the occurrence or failure to occur, of (i) any
event which occurrence or failure to occur would cause any of
its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at  



 

42  any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time, or (ii) any breach of
any covenant in this Agreement at any time from the date hereof to
the Effective Time; _provided,_ _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. No disclosure after
the date hereof of an inaccuracy of any representation and warranty made in
this Agreement shall affect any representation or warranty made herein.

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to give prompt notice to
each other of (i) any communication received from any Person alleging a
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any material
communication received from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Until the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall have the
obligation to promptly supplement the information contained in their
respective disclosure schedules attached hereto with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or discovered which, if in existence on the date hereof and
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such disclosure schedules. Neither the supplementation of the
disclosure schedules pursuant to the obligation in Section 7.12(c) nor any
disclosure after the date hereof an inaccuracy of any representation and
warranty made in this Agreement shall affect any representation or warranty
made herein.

7.13 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, or fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation, its Bylaws or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar
organizational documents or agreements of any of the Companys Subsidiaries,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Corporation (the "
_Indemnitors_ ") shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the Closing
Date serving as a director, officer or trustee, or as a fiduciary under or
with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in
settlement) resulting therefrom, and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or,
within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of
the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred
in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights
with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without
the requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of the Indemnitors pursuant to this Section 7.13(a)
shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating
thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased
to be a director, officer or trustee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the date hereof and shall inure to  



 

43  the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this Section 7.13(a): (x) the term "Claim" means
any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, whether instituted by
any party hereto, any Governmental Entity or any other party, that any
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of
any such Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director, officer or trustee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or fiduciary under or with respect to
any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) or any
other person at or prior to the Effective Time at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and (y) the term "Expenses" means reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations
(including, without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant
to this Section 7.13(a), including any Action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has
been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto. 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or its bylaws (or, as applicable, the
charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
assumed by Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the organizational
documents of Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder
of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or with respect to any employee
benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), unless such
modification shall be required by law and then only to the minimum extent
required by law.

(d) Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six (6)
years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that (i) that
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that such
substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to
matters occurring before the Effective Time, (ii) in no event shall Surviving
Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.13(d) more than
an amount per  



 

44  year of coverage equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that,
but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company, Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the
current annual premiums paid by the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause
Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns to, maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

(e) If Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving limited liability company, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.13.

(f) Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations
of Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.13 and the parties acknowledge
and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of Surviving
Corporations obligations pursuant to this Section 7.13.

(g) This Section 7.13 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and Surviving Corporation. Each
of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 7.13.

7.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall keep Parent informed of, and
cooperate with Parent in connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that all
obligations in this Section 7.14 shall be subject to the obligations of the
Company under applicable laws relating to attorney-client communication and
privilege.

7.15 _Listing_. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the Shares to be de-
listed from the AMEX and de-registered under the Exchange Act following the
Effective Time.

7.16 _Rule 14(d)(10)_. Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (acting
through its Board of Directors and Compensation Committee) shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under amended Rule 14d-10(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or
employee benefit arrangements that have been or will be entered into by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates entered into in
connection with, or in anticipation of, this Agreement, or any such
arrangement which could reasonably be expected to fall within the non-
exclusive safe harbor provisions of such rule.

7.17 _CFIUS; Exon-Florio_. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Parties shall prepare and file with the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS) a joint voluntary notice under the
Exon-Florio amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended
(Exon-Florio), with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
The Parties shall provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental
information requested by CFIUS or its member agencies during the Exon-Florio
review process. The Parties, in cooperation with each other, shall take all
commercially reasonable steps advisable, necessary or desirable to finally and
successfully complete the Exon-Florio review process as promptly as
practicable.



 

45 7.18 _DSS_. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and submit to the Defense Security Service (DSS) of the
United States Department of Defense and, to the extent applicable, the United
States Department of Energy (DOE) a notification under the National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and any applicable DoE security
regulations, and fully cooperate with Parent in requesting from DSS and to the
extent applicable, DoE approval to operate the business of the Company
pursuant to Parents existing Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)
mitigation plan.

cause of, or primarily resulted in, such purchase not occurring before such
date;

other action has become final and non-appealable; _provided,_ _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(ii)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or primarily resulted in, such
action by such Government Entity;

(iii) if the representations and warranties of the other party contained in
this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the condition set forth
in Section (b)(i) of _Annex A_ would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date, provided however, that the party seeking to terminate the

provided further that if (i) the right to terminate pursuant to this Section

Sub as of the end of such 30 day period.



 

47 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company, as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no further obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective officers or
directors, except as provided in Section 9.3 and except that in the case of
any such termination, Section 7.8(c), this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and
Article 10 shall survive. Nothing in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any action or omission that
constitutes fraud.

9.3  _Termination Payment; Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c), then the Company shall pay to Parent
within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, the
Termination Fee, which amount shall be payable in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent; or

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d), then the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent, contemporaneously with notice of
termination thereunder.

(b) In the event the Termination Fee contemplated by Section 9.3(a) is not
paid when due, the Termination Fee payment shall bear interest at a rate equal
to the prime rate announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal plus
1% per annum, and in addition to being obligated to pay make such payment and
interest thereon, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Parents costs and
expenses (including but not limited to reasonable legal fees and expenses)
solely to the extent incurred in connection with any action, including but
not limited to the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action to collect
payment of the Termination Fee and any interest thereon.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
Section 9.3(d), the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with
respect to any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable, the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light
of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute
liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim
which Parent and Merger Sub would otherwise be entitled to assert against the
Company or any of its assets, or against any of its directors, officers,
employees and stockholders with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub. Except for nonpayment of the
Termination Fee, the parties hereby agree that, upon termination of this
Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against
the Company or any of its assets, or against any of its directors,
officers, employees or stockholders or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any
other damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential,
indirect or punitive damages.

(d) If the Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(iii) or (iv) or by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(e), then Parent
shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the third-party, out of pocket
expenses incurred by the Company (plus any interest payable pursuant to this
Section 8.3(d)) (the " _Company Expenses_ "), which amount shall not exceed
$1,000,000. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3(d), the Company
Expenses shall be paid to the Company by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified to Parent by the Company and such
amount shall be paid within two (2) Business Day of termination. Parent
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3(d) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated in this  



 

48  Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) when it is required to be paid, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a
judgment against Parent for the fees set forth in this Section 9.3(d), Parent
shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit, including any costs of collection, together with
interest bearing a rate equal to the prime rate announced from time to time by
The Wall Street Journal plus 1% per annum

(e) If the Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii)
or (iv) and the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 9.3(a),
then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the third-party, out
of pocket expenses incurred by Parent (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), which
amount shall not exceed $1,000,000. The Parent Expenses shall be paid to

litigation in the Relevant Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Relevant Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an

is intended to waive the right of any party to remove any such action or
proceeding commenced in any such state court to an appropriate federal court
to the extent the basis for such removal exists under applicable law. The
parties agree that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, of any process required by any Relevant Court, to the

of process against them, without necessity for service by any other means
provided by statute or rule of court.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of

declared to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision will not have
the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the
part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid, unenforceable or void
will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom, and the remainder will have
the same force and effectiveness as if such stricken part or parts had never
