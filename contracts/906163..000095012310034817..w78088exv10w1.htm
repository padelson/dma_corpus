 SECTION 2.7 _Casualty Events, Condemnation_. 

   

 (a) In the event of any damage to or destruction of any Purchased Asset (other than normal wear and tear) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing (in any such case, a " _Damage or Destruction Loss_ "), Seller shall give notice thereof to the Purchaser. If any 

      #####

and claim of the Sellers to any proceeds of insurance for such Damage or

Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon the amount of
such reduction. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within five (5)
Business Days after notice of the Damage or Destruction Loss is given by the
Sellers, then the amount of the reduction shall be determined by an

they are unable to agree on such selection, one appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court upon application of either Party) whose determination of such reduction
shall be final and binding upon the parties. In addition, with respect to any
Damage or Destruction Loss covered by policies of insurance, at Closing,

 SECTION 2.9 _Environmental Matters_. 

   

 (a) Until June 1, 2010, Purchaser will have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to perform environmental investigations of the Real Property, including but not limited to, Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments (" _Purchaser ยs Environmental Diligence_") and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in the performance of Purchaserยs Environmental Diligence. In connection therewith, Purchaser, its agents or employees, will not enter upon any of the Real Property without twenty-four (24) hours prior notice to Parent, and all tests or inspections will be scheduled and conducted in a manner which does not violate applicable law or interfere with any Selling Affiliateยs development work on any portion of the Real Property. Purchaser, at Purchaserยs sole cost and expense, shall promptly repair any damage to the Real Property caused in connection with any investigations conducted by Purchaser on the Real Property pursuant to this _Section 2.9_. Moreover, prior to any entry upon any portion of the Real Property, Purchaser will deliver to Parent a certified copy of a commercial general liability insurance policy with limits of not less than One Million Dollars 

      ##### 

  

    

($1,000,000.00), combined single limit, insuring against claims for personal
injury or death or property damage occasioned by accidents occurring on the
Real Property and relating to or arising out of Purchaserยs activities
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_. Purchaser shall promptly provide to Parent
copies of any reports or other results of Purchaserยs
Environmental Diligence. 

   

 (b) If, on or before June 1, 2010, Purchaser notifies Parent in writing that Purchaserยs Environmental Diligence has identified an issue which requires Remediation of any Individual Property in order for such Individual Property to comply with environmental standards applicable to residential real estate (as recommended by the applicable consultant conducting such Purchaserยs Environmental Diligence), the parties will proceed to Closing with respect to such Individual Property and a portion of the Holdback Amount, equal to the reasonable, good faith estimate as agreed by Parent and Purchaser, of the total future costs to complete Remediation at the specified Individual Properties (but in no event more than $1 million in aggregate with regard to all issues and Individual Properties requiring Remediation) (such amounts, collectively, the " _Environmental Holdback Amount_ "), shall be designated to secure the performance of such Remediation (with any amounts of such designated portion in excess of the actual cost of such Remediation released to Parent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Closing Agreement). If Purchaser does not notify Parent of any issues on or before June 1, 2010, it shall be deemed to have waived any objections or claims with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of the Holdback Amount shall be designated to secure Remediation of the matters disclosed to Purchaser prior to the date hereof, the cost of which Remediation shall be for Purchaserยs account. 

   

 (c) Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement for the actual third party costs and expenses in performing Remediation at the sites identified in paragraph (b) above (" _Remediation Costs_ ") solely from and to the extent of the Environmental Holdback Amount held by the Escrow Agent. To obtain such reimbursement, Purchaser shall first present such request for reimbursement to Parent with a copy to the Escrow Agent, along with invoices reflecting the Remediation Costs for which Purchaser is then seeking reimbursement. Unless Parent objects to such request in a written notice delivered to Purchaser, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such request, Escrow Agent shall disburse funds to the Purchaser from the Environmental Holdback Amount on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the date of the reimbursement request. If Parent objects to the reimbursement request, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the funds subject to such objection to Purchaser only after receipt of a notice signed by Parent and Purchaser stating that the dispute has been resolved and setting forth the amount to be disbursed to Purchaser. At such time as Purchaser has completed any Remediation identified in accordance with paragraph (b) above and has been reimbursed for such Remediation Costs, Purchaser shall provide a notice to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Parent the remaining balance, if any, of the Environmental Holdback Amount and the Escrow Agent shall disburse such funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice. 

   

 SECTION 2.10 _Title and Survey_. 

   

 (a) Until June 1, 2010, Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense, obtain a Title Commitment covering all or some of the Individual Properties from the Title Company and may, at Purchaserยs option and at its sole cost and expense, obtain a current Survey of all or any 

      ##### 

  

    

portion of all or some of the Individual Properties. Until June 1, 2010,
Purchaser may deliver, from time to time, written notice (a " _Title
Objection Notice_ ") to Parent identifying any exceptions to title or any
survey matters affecting any Individual Property which are not Permitted
Liens (within clauses (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of the definition
thereof) (" _Title Objections_ ") which are disclosed in the Title Commitment
or Survey. Any title or survey matters affecting any Individual Property
which are not identified by Purchaser as Title Objections pursuant to a Title
Objection Notice delivered to Parent within the time period set forth above
which exist on the Closing Date shall be conclusively deemed to be acceptable
to Purchaser and shall thereafter be conclusively deemed to be part of the
Permitted Liens for all purposes under this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If Purchaser delivers written notice of Title Objections pursuant to a Title Objection Notice to Parent on or before June 1, 2010: 

    

 (i) to the extent the Sellers are able to deliver good and marketable fee simple title to the applicable Individual Property, and provided that such Title Objections do not materially interfere with Purchaserยs ability to develop the applicable Individual Property as residential building lots, the parties shall proceed to Closing with respect to such Individual Property and the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by an agreed upon amount to reflect diminution of value of such Individual Property due to such Title Objections; _provided_ , that Parent may exclude such Individual Property from the Closing and the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by the Purchase Price allocable to such Individual Property and at such time as Parent has cured such Title Objections Purchaser shall then purchase such Individual Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and 

   

 (ii) to the extent Sellers are unable to deliver good and marketable fee simple title to the Individual Property, or to the extent that the Title Objections would materially interfere with Purchaserยs ability to develop the applicable Individual Property as residential building lots, the parties shall proceed to Closing without Purchaser acquiring such Individual Property, and the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the Purchase Price allocable to such Individual Property. 

 

In the event that Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree upon the manner in
which a Title Objection is to be resolved in accordance with this paragraph,
then the applicable Individual Property shall be excluded from the Closing,
the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be reduced by the Purchase
Price allocable to such Individual Property, and, at such time as
such dispute has been resolved, Purchaser shall purchase such Individual
Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, subject to the terms
upon which the disputed Title Objection shall have been resolved. 

   

 SECTION 2.11 _Assignment of HOA Documents_. To the extent that a Seller is the declarant, or an assignee of a declarant, under the applicable HOA Documents for an Individual Property, such Seller shall obtain all necessary consents (other than consents of any Governmental Body) to assignment of its rights as declarant, or assignee of a declarant, and shall duly and validly assign all such rights to Purchaser at Closing; _provided_ , in the event that any such assignment is not effected as to any Individual Property at Closing, Purchaser may exclude 

     ##### 

 

  

such Individual Property from the Closing and the Purchase Price payable at
the Closing shall be reduced by the Purchase Price allocable to such
Individual Property; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that at such time as such
Seller is capable of effecting such assignment, Purchaser shall acquire such
Individual Property upon payment of the Purchase Price allocable to such
Individual Property. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consents (and cooperate with Purchaser obtaining such consents of
Governmental Bodies and until receipt thereof, at Purchaserยs sole cost,
expense, and liability, Seller shall take such other actions as declarant
thereunder that Purchaser may reasonably request) and effect such assignments
for each Individual Property, including with respect to any Individual
Properties excluded from Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.11_. Once such
consents are obtained and such assignments are effected, Purchaser shall
purchase such Individual Properties in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 2.12 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Parent a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") setting forth its proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Parent agrees that promptly after receiving said Allocation Schedule, it shall return an executed copy thereof to Purchaser with any proposed adjustments thereto. Purchaser and Parent shall promptly thereafter agree on allocations of the Purchase Price that satisfy applicable law and regulations. Purchaser and Parent each agree to use such allocations for purposes of paying any transfer or similar Taxes and to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation Schedule. Purchaser and Parent each agree to provide the other promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594.

by applicable law, providing copies of all such documents to the non-
filing parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection
with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with
respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each such party shall use
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral
communication with, and provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No
party hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with
any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
(to the extent legally permissible) and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to
applicable Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf
of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws. Parent and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 8.4_ as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be). 

   

 (b) Each of Purchaser and Parent shall use its best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement is in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and Parent shall cooperate and use its best efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement, Purchaser and Parent decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Purchaser and Parent shall use its 

      ##### 

  

    

best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
Purchaser and Parent agrees to use its best efforts to take promptly any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-
United States antitrust or competition authority, so as to enable the parties
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
possible. 

   

 SECTION 8.5 _Further Assurances_. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 8.6 _Confidentiality_. 

   

 (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the confidential information provided to it in connection with this Agreement, including under _Section 8.1_, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Parent dated March 21, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Purchased Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other confidential information provided to it by Parent or its representatives concerning any Seller shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Sellers covenant and agree to keep and maintain the results of Purchaserยs investigations, studies, tests, memoranda, analyses, and any other work product, strictly confidential and shall not disclose any information regarding the results of Buyerยs investigation, studies, tests, memoranda, analyses, and any other work product, directly or indirectly, to any Person, other than their respective attorneys or employees ( _provided_ Sellers ensure that any such Persons are required to be legally bound by the terms and provisions of this _Section 8.6(b)_) or otherwise required by applicable Law without the prior written consent of the other party;  _provided_ , that (i) the terms and provisions of this _Section 8.6(b)_ shall not be deemed violated as a result of any act of the Sellers taken in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order and (ii) with respect to any Individual Properties that are excluded from the Closing hereunder, Sellers shall be permitted to provide summaries and other descriptions of such investigations, studies, tests, memoranda, analyses and other work product to interested Persons in connection with the Bankruptcy Case (including to facilitate the submission of Qualified Bids);  _provided_ that Sellers shall provide Purchaser with an opportunity to review and comment on any such summaries and other descriptions within a reasonable time prior to Sellersย provision thereof to such interested Persons. 

   

 SECTION 8.7 _Publicity_. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated 

      ##### 

  

    

hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the
sole judgment of Purchaser or Parent, disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to filings to be made
with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or Parent lists
securities, _provided_ that the party intending to make such release shall
use its best efforts consistent with such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court
requirement to consult with the other party with respect to the
text thereof. 

   

 SECTION 8.8 _Supplementation and Amendment of the Disclosure Schedule_. Parent or as applicable, Purchaser, may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items are material except to the extent a particular representation is qualified by materiality, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. The disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. From time to time prior to the Closing, Parent shall have the right to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , no such supplement or amendment shall have any effect on, and shall not be taken into consideration in determining, the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Closing shall occur, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to _Article X_ hereof, with respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to any such supplement or amendment at or prior to the Closing. 

   

 SECTION 8.9 _Court Order_. Subject to _Article VII_, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding Procedures Order by May 7, 2010 and the Sale Order by June 30, 2010. If an objection is filed or otherwise made to the Sale Motion, which is an objection which would prohibit or otherwise prevent the Closing from occurring pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Sellers shall use best efforts to have such objection overruled. 

   

 SECTION 8.10 _Adequate Assurance of Future Performance_. Purchaser shall be required to provide adequate assurance of future performance by Purchaser or any designee thereof with respect to the Purchased Contracts and Purchased Leases and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor any Seller shall have any liability for Purchaserยs failure to satisfy such requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take all actions reasonably requested by Parent or ordered by the Bankruptcy Court to assist in obtaining the Bankruptcy Courtยs entry of an order approving this Agreement, such as furnishing affidavits, financial information, confidential information subject to a reasonable form of confidentiality agreement or other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making Purchaserยs employees and representatives available to be interviewed by Parentยs attorneys and to testify before the Bankruptcy Court and at depositions, with respect to demonstrating adequate assurance of future performance by Purchaser and its designees of the Assumed Liabilities.

 SECTION 8.11 _Purchaser Covenants after Closing; Access_. Without prejudice to  _Section 8.15_, Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall, from and after the Closing Date (unless otherwise agreed with Parent) do each of the following: 

    

 (a) during the first ninety (90) days following the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice, afford to Parentยs officers, independent public accountants, attorneys, lenders, consultants and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to the Purchased Assets and all records pertaining to the Purchased Assets. 

   

 (b) not pursue any avoidance actions or claims under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code against all parties covered by avoidance actions that are Excluded Assets. 

  

 SECTION 8.12 _Replacement of Commitments_. In connection with Sellersย development work for the Purchased Assets, Sellers have posted with the appropriate Governmental Body certain surety bonds, letters of credit and escrows as more particularly described on _Schedule 8.12_ attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the " _Commitments_ "). As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date, Purchaser, at Purchaserยs sole cost and expense, shall (i) deliver to the appropriate Governmental Body, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Governmental Body to accept, substitute bonds, letters of credit and escrows (collectively, the " _Substitute Commitments_ ") for Sellersย Commitments, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the appropriate Governmental Bodies to return Sellersย Commitments to Sellers so that the same are of no further force or effect. Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in order for Purchaser to perform the obligations of Purchaser described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. To the extent any of the Commitments have been drawn by a beneficiary at or prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased (i) pursuant to the Closing Adjustment, by the amount of any Qualified Development Costs paid from the amounts so drawn, and (ii) by the amount so drawn, so long as such amounts are held in the form of cash or cash equivalents. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Sellers harmless from and against all costs, expenses, liabilities and causes of action (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneysย fees) resulting from any draws on Sellersย Commitments on or after the Closing Date and prior to the date that the Substitute Commitments have been delivered to and accepted by the appropriate Governmental Body and Sellersย Commitments have been returned to Sellers and the Sellersย Agreements have been terminated and canceled; _provided_ that, if the events giving rise to such draws occurred prior to the Closing Date, the amounts so drawn are held in the form of cash or used to pay Qualified Development Costs. At the Closing, Sellers shall assign to Purchaser the right to receive the return of any cash deposits then held by, or subsequently drawn and held by, the beneficiaries of the Commitments. In the event that, following Closing, Sellers receive any cash payments in respect of Commitments drawn by a beneficiary at or prior to or following Closing, Seller shall promptly pay the amount so received to Purchaser. This  _Section 8.12_ shall survive Closing hereunder. 

   

 SECTION 8.13 _Name Changes_. Following Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to the use of the name "Orleans" or similar names or any service marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems or signs containing or comprising the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto in connection with the Purchased Assets. 

    ##### 

  

    

For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall have the right to use such name,
together with a nonexclusive royalty-free license to use any other
Intellectual Property included in the Purchased Assets, as may be necessary
solely in connection with the orderly operation and disposal of the
Excluded Assets. In furtherance of the foregoing, at Closing, the applicable
Seller and Purchaser shall enter into a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-
free license under which the applicable Seller shall license such
Intellectual Property to Purchaser. 

   

 SECTION 8.14 _Financial Statements_. Prior to Closing, Parent shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser the following, prepared in accordance with GAAP and other relevant SEC requirements: (a) audited financial statements and related footnotes as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and an audit report of the Sellerยs Independent Registered Accounting Firm (" _IRAF_ ") thereon; (b) reviewed interim financial statements as of and for the three (3) months ended September 30, 2009, and a review report of the IRAF thereon; (c) reviewed interim financial statements as of and for the three (3) and six (6) months ended December 31, 2009, and a review report of the IRAF thereon; and (d) reviewed interim financial statements as of and for the three (3) and nine (9) months ended March 31, 2010, and a review report of the IRAF thereon. Sellers acknowledge and agree that Purchaser may be required to include financial statements of Parent or combined financial statements of the Purchased Assets in reports that Purchaser is required to file pursuant to applicable securities laws. Parent agrees that Purchaser may execute and deliver an engagement letter with the IRAF, pursuant to which the IRAF shall provide to Purchaser, at Purchaserยs expense, a certification of such historical financial statements of Parent, or shall reasonably assist Purchaser in preparing such combined financial statements of the Purchased Assets, as may be required to enable Purchaser to comply with its reporting obligations under applicable securities laws. In addition, prior to Closing, Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser and its independent accountants (including the IRAF) and to give each access, during business hours upon reasonable prior notice, to such of its books and records and to direct their management personnel to cooperate with the Purchaser and its independent accountants (including the provision of customary management representation letters), in each case to the extent necessary to enable the Purchaser to produce and, where applicable, audit any financials statement of Parent or the Purchased Assets that Purchaser may require in order to comply with its reporting obligations. 

   

 SECTION 8.15 _Transition Arrangements_. Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, provide Sellers and their authorized agents and representatives (including lenders) with such access and administrative services as are reasonably necessary to permit Sellers to wind down and liquidate their estates after Closing, including the administration of a plan of liquidation, reconciliation of claims and making distributions, provided that the provision of such access and services shall not disrupt the conduct of the business of Purchaser and its Affiliates. Such services will include (a) reasonable access, during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to any of Purchaserยs and its Affiliatesย personnel who have knowledge of the Purchased Assets, information technology systems (if Purchaser shall have acquired Sellersย information technology systems) and books and records relating to the Purchased Assets for periods prior to the Closing and (b) the use of office space and office support for employees of Sellers and their authorized agents and representatives (including lenders) engaged in such wind-down and liquidation process, to the extent that Purchaser and its Affiliates have available office space. Sellers will reimburse Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with providing such services (which for the 

    ##### 

  

    

avoidance of doubt will not include overhead of, or salaries paid to
employees of, Purchaser or its Affiliates).

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of Sellers shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of Sellers under this Agreement or the Seller Documents of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 

   

 SECTION 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in as many counterparts as may be required, which counterparts may be delivered by facsimile or electronic mail, and it shall not be necessary that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party, appear on each counterpart; but it shall be sufficient that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party, or that the signatures of the persons required to bind any party, appear on one or more such counterparts. All such counterparts when taken together shall constitute a single and legally binding agreement. 

   

 SECTION 12.12 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Certain provisions of this Agreement require adjustments to the payments otherwise required to be made hereunder based on the purchase price allocable to one or more Individual Properties. Prior to signing this Agreement, Purchaser has provided to Escrow Agent a schedule allocating the Base Purchase Price to each Individual Property. Escrow Agent shall maintain the confidentiality of such allocations and not disclose them except as provided in this _Section 12.12_. The allocations will be used in determining any Purchase Price adjustments to be made hereunder. In the event that the parties exclude any Real Property from the Purchased Assets to be purchased at Closing or if Parent determines that any Individual Property cannot be conveyed to Purchaser, or that there is a material risk that any Individual Property cannot be conveyed to Purchaser, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall deliver a joint written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall disclose to the parties the allocation assigned to such Individual Property and, if such disclosure is made prior to conclusion of any auction pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, Parent shall be entitled to disclose the adjustment to the Purchase Price that would result if such Individual Property were to be excluded from the Closing.

FOR AN AUCTION AND FOR HEARING ON APPROVAL OF (a) SALE OF ASSETS, 
 (b) ASSUMPTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF 
 CERTAIN EXECUTORY 

  

 _CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES, AND (c) OTHER RELATED RELIEF_

    

 The above-captioned debtors and debtors in possession (collectively, the "Debtors") having requested by motion dated April 13, 2010 (Docket No. [___]) (the "Sale Motion")2 orders (A)(I) approving the sale procedures and bidding protections to be employed in connection with the proposed sale (the "Sale") of substantially all of the Debtorsย assets (collectively, the "Purchased Assets"), (II) scheduling an auction (the "Auction") and a hearing (the "Sale Hearing") to consider approval of (i) the Sale, (ii) the assumption and assignment of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases in connection with the Sale and the rejection of other such executory contracts and unexpired leases, and (iii) other related relief, and (III) approving the proposed notice of the respective dates, times, and places for the Auction and for the Sale Hearing (the relief requested in such items (A)(I) through (III) is collectively referred to herein as the "Initial Relief"); and (B)(I) authorizing and approving a proposed asset purchase agreement, dated as of April 13, 2010, with NVR, Inc. (the "Proposed Buyer"), or such other purchaser(s) providing a higher or otherwise better offer for the Purchased Assets, as approved by this Court at the Sale Hearing; (II) authorizing the Sale of the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens and Liabilities (other than the Permitted Liens and the Assumed Liabilities); (III) authorizing the assumption and assignment of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases in connection with the Sale and the rejection of other executory contracts and unexpired leases; (IV) authorizing the Debtors to consummate all transactions related to the above; and (V) granting other relief; and this Courtยs having conducted a hearing on May 4, 2010 to consider the Initial Relief (the "Bidding Procedures Hearing"); and upon the record of the Bidding Procedures Hearing and the Bankruptcy Cases; and it appearing that, under the circumstances here, present, good, sufficient, and timely notice of the relief sought and granted in this Order having been given, and good and sufficient cause existing to have conducted the Bidding Procedures Hearing and approve the Initial Relief; and it further appearing that no other or further notice of the relief provided for herein need be given; and after due deliberation and sufficient cause appearing therefor, it is hereby 

   

 FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT: 

   

 A. The Court has jurisdiction over the Sale Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 157 and 1334. This matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 157(b)(2). Venue of the above-captioned Chapter 11 cases (the "Cases") and the Sale Motion in this District is proper under 28 

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    2  |   | All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to them in the Sale Motion, and, as applicable, any
exhibits thereto (including the APA).  
      ##### 

  

      

U.S.C. ยงยง 1408 and 1409. 

   

 B. The statutory and rule-based predicates for the relief sought in the Sale Motion are Bankruptcy Code ยงยง 105, 363, and 365; Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6003, 6004, 6006, 9007, and 9014; and Local Rule 6004-1. 

  

 C. The findings and conclusions set forth herein constitute this Courtยs findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052, made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014\. To the extent any of the foregoing findings of fact constitute conclusions of law, they are adopted as such. To the extent any of the following conclusions of law constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as such. 

  

 D. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient reasons for approving the Bidding Procedures (including, without limitation, the payment of the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement, and requiring the Proposed Buyer to submit the Deposit and any Qualified Bidder to submit a Bid Deposit) and the Auction and Hearing Notice, in connection with the Sale of the Purchased Assets. The Debtors have also demonstrated a compelling and sound business justification for authorization to enter into the APA or to sell (in their discretion) the Excluded Assets. Entry of this Order is in the best interests of the Debtors and their estates, creditors, and interest holders and all other parties in interest herein. 

  

 E. The Bidding Procedures, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1, are fair, reasonable, and appropriate and are designed to maximize the recovery on the Purchased Assets. The APA and its terms and conditions and the Bidding Procedures were negotiated in good faith and at armsย-length between the Debtors and the Proposed Buyer and their respective legal and financial advisors. 

  

 F. The Auction and Hearing Notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2, 

   ##### 

  

 

provides due, adequate, and timely notice of the Auction, the Sale, and the
other transactions contemplated in the APA and the Sale Motion (collectively,
the "Transactions"), and all relevant objection deadlines, in accordance with
Bankruptcy Rule 2002 and the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. 

   

 G. The scope of the notice of the Sale Motion, the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Sale, the Sale Hearing, and all the other Transactions proposed to be provided by the Debtors in the Sale Motion and the Bidding Procedures constitutes due, sufficient, and adequate notice to all parties-in-interest of the Auction, the Sale, and all the other Transactions, and all relevant objection deadlines. Such proposed notice of the Sale Motion, the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Sale, the Sale Hearing, and all the other Transactions is appropriate and reasonably calculated to provide all interested parties with timely and proper notice and an opportunity to be heard, and no other or further notice thereof is required. 

  

 H. The notice to counterparties of the Purchased Contracts and the Purchased Leases provided in accordance with the Bidding Procedures is reasonably calculated to provide all counterparties to the Purchased Contracts and the Purchased Leases with proper notice of the potential assumption and assignment of their executory contract or unexpired lease and any Cure Amounts associated therewith. The notice to counterparties to any other contracts and leases to be rejected as provided in the Section 365 Notice with respect to contracts and leases to be rejected by the Debtors in connection with the Sale Order is reasonably calculated to provide all counterparties to such contracts and leases with proper notice of the potential rejection of their executory contract or unexpired lease. 

  

 I. The Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement are essential inducements and conditions relating to the Proposed Buyerยs entry into, and continuing obligations under, the 

   ##### 

  

 

APA. Unless the Proposed Buyer is assured that the Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement will be available, the Proposed Buyer is unwilling to
remain obligated to consummate the Transactions or otherwise be bound under
the APA (including the obligations to maintain its committed offer while such
offer is subject to higher or otherwise better offers as contemplated by the
Bidding Procedures). The Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
induced the Proposed Buyer to submit a bid that will serve as a minimum or
floor bid at the Auction on which the Debtors, their creditors, and
other bidders can rely. The Proposed Buyer has provided a material benefit to
the Debtors and their creditors by increasing the likelihood that the best
possible purchase price for the Purchased Assets will be received.
Accordingly, the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement provide
an actual benefit to the Debtorsย estates, are necessary to preserve the
Debtorsย estates, represent the best method for maximizing value for the
benefit of the Debtorsย estates, and are reasonable and appropriate under the
circumstances. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY: 

   

 ORDERED that the Sale Motion is granted to the extent of the Initial Relief; and it is further 

   

 ORDERED that all objections to the Initial Relief that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled as announced to this Court at the Bidding Procedures Hearing or by stipulation filed with this Court, are overruled and deemed dismissed with prejudice; and it is further 

   

 ORDERED that the Debtors are authorized to enter into the APA and sell the Purchased Assets and/or the Excluded Developments by conducting the Auction in accordance with the Bidding Procedures, which procedures are hereby approved in their entirety and shall govern all bids and bid proceedings relating to the Purchased Assets; and it is further 

    ##### 

  

     

 ORDERED that the Debtors are authorized to take any and all actions necessary and/or appropriate to implement the Bidding Procedures; and it is further 

   

 ORDERED that the termination provisions of Article 4 of the APA, including, without limitation, the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement provisions of Sections 4.6(c) and 4.6(d) of the APA, are hereby approved and shall be binding upon the Debtors. The Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement shall be paid by the Debtors, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the APA, without any further approval or order of this Court, immediately upon the closing of a Competing Transaction, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude payment of the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 4.6(c) of the APA. The Proposed Buyer shall not waive the right to payment of the Termination Fee or the Expense Reimbursement by bidding or rebidding at the Auction. The Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement shall constitute administrative expense claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code ยง 503(b); and it is further 

   

 ORDERED that the form of the Auction and Hearing Notice is hereby approved in all respects, and the Debtors are authorized to cause the Auction and Hearing Notice to be served in the manner specified in the Bidding Procedures no later than 5 business days following the entry of this Order. Such service and the other means of service as described in the Motion shall be deemed due, timely, good, and sufficient notice of the entry of this Order, the Auction, the Sale Motion, the Sale Hearing, the Bidding Procedures, the proposed Sale Order, the proposed assumption and assignment of the Purchased Contracts and Purchased Leases, the proposed rejection of the Rejected Contracts, and all of the Transactions, and all proceedings to be held thereon and all relevant objection deadlines; and it is further 

    ##### 

  

     

 ORDERED that the Debtors are authorized, but not directed, to publish an abbreviated version of the Auction and Hearing Notice prior to the Auction in an appropriate publication or publications, to be determined by the Debtors, if they determine that such publication is in the best interests of their estates; and it is further

 _EXHIBIT 1_  

   

BIDDING PROCEDURES 

  

 The following procedures (collectively, the "Bidding Procedures") shall govern the sale (the "Sale") and auction (the "Auction") of all of the right, title, and interests in substantially all of the assets (the "Purchased Assets") of Orleans Homebuilders, Inc., and its debtor-subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the "Debtors"), which are debtors-in-possession in cases pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Court"). The bankruptcy cases were commenced on March 1, 2010 (the "Petition Date"). 

  

 These Bidding Procedures have been approved and authorized by an order of the Honorable Peter J. Walsh, United States Bankruptcy Court Judge, dated May [___], 2010 (the "Bidding Procedures Order"), upon the motion of the Debtors, dated April 13, 2010, seeking such relief and other proposed relief in connection with the Sale (the "Sale Motion"). Any party-in-interest who wishes to receive a copy of the Sale Motion, including the APA and all other exhibits thereto, may make such request in writing to the Debtorsย co-counsel, (i) Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp, Eighty Pine Street, New York, New York 10005-1702, Attn: Joel H. Levitin, Esq. (Telephone: 212-701-3000, Facsimile: (212) 378-2439), or (ii) Elliott Greenleaf, 1105 North Market Street, Suite 1700, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, Attn.: Rafael X. Zahralddin, Esq. (Telephone: (302) 384-9400, Facsimile: (302) 384-9399), or by downloading a copy of same from the Bankruptcy Courtยs website (which is located at http://www.deb.uscourts.gov) or from the website established by the Debtorsย noticing agent (which is located at _www.orleanshomesreorg.com_ ). 

 

1\. _The Purchased Assets_  

   

 The Debtors and certain non-debtor parties, OHI PA, LLC and OHI NJ, LLC (the "Sellers"), have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "APA"),1 dated as of April 13, 2010, with NVR, Inc. (including its permitted designees, the "Proposed Buyer"), pursuant to which the Proposed Buyer would acquire the Purchased Assets, subject to higher and better offers and Court approval. As further set forth in, and qualified by, the APA, the Purchased Assets include, among other things, the Debtorsย real property as set forth on Schedule 2.1(a) to the APA; certain accounts receivable; the Controlled Jobs; inventory, supplies, and materials; certain rights in or to joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships; the Purchased Contracts, the Purchased Leases, and all rights of the Debtors thereunder; deposits and prepaid charges and expenses; documents used in connection with the Debtorsย real property; permits; the Debtorsย intellectual property; rights in any homeowner associations or similar organizations; and all other assets used in connection with or related to the Purchased Assets listed on Schedule 2.1(p) to the APA. The Purchased Assets will be sold free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, and other interests, subject to agreement to the contrary with the successful bidder therefor with respect to the Permitted Liens. The Purchased Assets do not include, among other things, (i) bankruptcy causes of action, such as avoidance actions against the Debtorsย suppliers, vendors, merchants, manufacturers, or related parties, or other causes of action not related to the Purchased Assets; (ii) tax refunds; (iii) rights in respect of the Excluded Developments (which are the communities

referred to as Wildflower at Walkill, in Middletown, New York and Woodside
Crossing, in Rock Tavern, New York and related assets); or (iv) the Debtorsย
cash on hand. To the extent of any discrepancy between the description set
forth in this paragraph and the terms of the APA, the latter shall govern. 

   

 The Sale shall be on an "as is, where is" basis and without representations or warranties of any kind, nature, or description by the Debtors, their agents, or their estates, except to the extent expressly set forth in the APA with the Proposed Buyer or the Winning Competing Bidder, as the case may be. 

 

2\. _The Stalking Horse Agreement with the Proposed Buyer_  

   

 The Base Purchase Price under the APA is $170,000,000, subject to certain post-closing adjustments (including subtracting the aggregate amount of all Sellersย Assumed Cure Amounts), and the Proposed Buyer will also assume certain liabilities, including the Assumed Cure Amount and one-half of the Transfer Taxes due. 

  

 "Assumed Cure Amount" means with respect to each Purchased Lease or Purchased Contract, any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Bankruptcy Code ยง 365(b) or otherwise in order to cure any defaults existing as of the date of assumption in respect of such Purchased Lease or Purchased Contract, as approved by the Bankruptcy Court (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sellersย Assumed Cure Amounts). 

  

 The Proposed Buyer has agreed to provide the Debtors with a deposit in the amount of $17 million, which is 10% of the amount of the Base Purchase Price (the "Deposit"). The Proposed Buyer has already provided half of the Deposit, and will pay the balance on or prior to the Bidding Deadline. 

  

 The APA provides for the payment of a Termination Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement to the Proposed Buyer. The Debtors would be required to pay the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement upon the termination of the APA under certain circumstances as fully set forth in Section 4.6(d) of the APA. The Termination Fee represents 2% of the Base Purchase Price to be paid by the Proposed Buyer under the APA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors would be required to pay the Expense Reimbursement (in an amount of up to $1,000,000) upon the termination of the APA under certain circumstances as more fully set forth in Section 4.6(c) thereof. 

 

3\. _Submission of Bids_  

   

 The Debtors intend to deliver requests for bids to all parties who are known to have expressed an interest in acquiring the Purchased Assets. 

  

 Also, in the Auction and Hearing Notice, the Debtors will invite all potential bidders who have not previously executed a confidentiality agreement to request a copy of same from the Debtorsย Chief Restructuring Officer (the "CRO") and their advisors, BMO Capital Markets Corp. ("BMOCM") and Lieutenant Island Partners LLC ("Lieutenant Island"). These advisors on their own initiative, may also send a proposed confidentiality agreement to those parties who have not yet executed one but whom they or the Debtors have identified as potentially being interested in making an offer to purchase the Purchased Assets and participating in the Auction. All parties who timely execute and return a confidentiality agreement to the CRO, BMOCM, and Lieutenant Island and who provide, in the Debtorsย discretion, information demonstrating sufficient financial wherewithal to acquire the Purchased Assets, will be provided access to the due diligence materials the Debtors and their advisors have already prepared for this purpose. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Thereafter, the Debtors and the CRO, BMOCM, and Lieutenant Island will entertain any further reasonable requests for additional information and due diligence from any party who has so executed a confidentiality agreement and provided the required satisfactory evidence of financial wherewithal, and has also submitted a written non-binding expression of interest to the reasonable satisfaction of the Debtors and their advisors. The Debtors, in their discretion, may deny any such requests for additional information, if, after taking into account, among other things, business factors, legal, regulatory, and other considerations, they determine that doing so would not be in the best interests of their estates and creditors or is otherwise contrary to the goals of the Auction and the Sale. 

  

 All bids for the acquisition of the Purchased Assets must in writing, comply with the Bidding Procedures, and be received by (1) BMO Capital Markets Corp., 115 South LaSalle Street, 35th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attn: Mr. Scott W.

Riley, Esq. and Sommer L. Ross, Esq., (ii) Duane Morris LLP, 1540 Broadway, New York, New York 10036-4086, Attn.: Gerard S. Catalanello, Esq. and James J. Vincequerra, Esq., (iii) Duane Morris LLP, 30 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103-4196, Attn.: Lawrence J. Kotler, Esq., and (e) co-counsel to the Proposed Buyer, (i) Hogan and Hartson LLP, 875 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, Attn.: Ira S. Greene, Esq. and Scott A. Golden, Esq., and (ii) Potter Anderson and Corroon LLP, 1313 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19899, Attn.: Steven M. Yoder, Esq., no later than 12:00 noon (prevailing Eastern Time) on June 16, 2010 (the "Bidding Deadline"). The Debtors reserve the right to (a) amend and/or impose additional terms and/or conditions at or prior to the Auction (other than the requirements for a Qualified Bid set forth herein and the right of the Proposed Buyer to make a revised higher or better offer at any time during the Auction) that they believe will better promote the goals of the Auction and be in the best interests of their estates, and do not otherwise conflict with the terms and requirements set forth in the APA and (b) subject to the terms of the APA, extend the deadlines set forth in the Bidding Procedures and/or adjourn the Auction at the Auction and/or the Sale Hearing in open court or on the Bankruptcy Courtยs calendar on the date scheduled for said hearing without further notice to creditors or parties-in-interest. 

  

 Any party interested in making a Bid must comply with these Bidding Procedures. Only Qualified Bidders will be eligible and entitled to bid at the Auction, unless the Debtors or the Bankruptcy Court determine otherwise. The Proposed Buyer will be deemed a Qualified Bidder, and the APA will be deemed a Qualified Bid, for all purposes of the Auction. Within 3 days after the Bidding Deadline, the Debtors shall notify all parties who submitted bids whether or not they constitute a Qualified Bidder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 In addition to the Proposed Buyer, a "Qualified Bidder" is one who has complied with the terms and conditions set forth herein, including, without limitation, having demonstrated the ability to close the Transactions to the reasonable satisfaction of the Debtors. In order to be considered for Qualified Bidder status, a Person must: (a) make a Bid prior to the Bidding Deadline (as such terms are defined below); (b) provide financial statements or other evidence of financial wherewithal reasonably satisfactory to the Debtors, demonstrating its ability to perform and consummate the transaction described in its Bid (including, to the extent applicable, by providing an Adequate Assurance Package (as such term is defined below) and proof of such bidderยs ability to satisfy the balance of the proposed purchase price or to provide any other consideration to be given in connection with the Sale); (c) provide a bid letter including a statement that it is willing to proceed as a buyer on a basis substantially similar to that of the Proposed Buyer with respect to the Purchased Assets and/or the Region(s) that is the subject of the Bid (including with respect to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, or to the extent the Bid is for fewer than for all 4 of the Regions, such Assumed Liabilities as relate to the Region(s) in question), and include a binding, definitive, and irrevocable executed copy of the APA marked with interlineations indicating any modifications thereto required by the bidder (which agreement shall not contain the provisions set forth in Section 4.6 of the APA or otherwise entitle such bidder to a Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement); (d) complete and execute a confidentiality agreement acceptable to the Debtors and their professionals; and (e) provide an earnest money deposit of equal to 10% of the amount of its bid, upon submission of the Bid (the "Bid Deposit"). The Debtors may request additional information from a Competing Bidder in order to evaluate the bidderยs ability to consummate a transaction and to fulfill its obligations in connection therewith, and such bidder will be obligated to provide such information as a precondition to participating further in the Auction. 

  

 The Bid Deposit shall be in the form of a wire transfer to the account of an escrow agent selected by the Debtors (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to instructions to be provided upon request. The Bid Deposit, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to any Bidder whose Bid is not accepted by the Debtors within 3 business days of the conclusion of the Sale Hearing, except that in the case of the party who submits the Second Place Bid (as such term is defined below), the Debtors reserve the right to retain such bidderยs Bid Deposit until 3 days after the Transactions with the Winning Competing Bidder has been consummated. If the entity that makes the Winning Competing Bid (as such term is defined below) fails to consummate the purchase of the Purchased Assets, and such failure to consummate the purchase or purchases is the result of a breach by the Winning Competing Bidder, such bidderยs Bid Deposit shall be forfeited to the Debtors and the Debtors specifically reserve the right to seek all available damages from the defaulting bidder. 

  

 To be considered a Qualified Bid, a bid must: (a) specify the portion of the consideration to be paid in cash and the portion to be paid in any other form of value (if any), including specifying any liability of the Debtors that the Bidder intends to assume in connection with the Sale above and beyond the Assumed Liabilities; (b) if any consideration above and beyond the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities is to be provided in a form other than cash, provide information concerning such consideration to permit the Debtors to accurately assess the value of such consideration; (c) if (as described below) the bid contemplates a purchase of fewer than all of the Purchased Assets (or not all 4 of the Regions), provide sufficient detail concerning which of the Purchased Assets (and/or Regions, as applicable) would not be purchased thereby, or if the bid contemplates a purchase of any or all of the Excluded Assets, provide sufficient detail concerning which of the Excluded Assets would also be purchased thereby; (d) provide sufficient indicia that such bidder or its representative is legally empowered, by power of attorney or otherwise, and financially capable (i) to bid on behalf of the prospective bidder and (ii) to complete and sign, on behalf of the bidder, a binding and enforceable asset purchase agreement; (e) not contain any contingencies to closing that are not also set forth in Article IX of the APA, including, without limitation, any contingencies for financing, diligence, board approval, or similar 

   ##### 

  

 

contingencies or conditions; (f) identify with particularity each and every
executory contract or unexpired lease the assumption and assignment of which
is a condition to closing, to the extent different from the Assigned
Agreements proposed to be assumed and assigned to the Proposed Buyer under
the APA; and (g) require the competing bidder to consummate the Sale on
substantially the same timing as set forth in the APA. 

   

 Except as otherwise set forth herein, any initial bid of a Competing Bidder (an "Initial Competing Bid") made prior to the Bidding Deadline may (a) not be less than $178,000,000, consisting of the sum of the (i) Base Purchase Price, (ii) the sum of the Termination Fee in the amount of $3,400,000 plus the Expense Reimbursement in the amount of $1,000,000, and (iii) a minimum incremental overbid of at least $3,600,000, (b) provide that the bidder will assume or pay at Closing substantially all of the Assumed Liabilities (or all of the liabilities with respect to the individual Region(s) that is the subject of such Initial Competing Bid, to the extent it is for fewer than all 4 of the Regions, as discussed below), and (c) otherwise be on terms that are substantially similar to, or more favorable to the Debtors, than those set forth in the APA with the Proposed Buyer with respect to the Purchased Assets and/or the Region(s) that is the subject of the Bid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors may, in their discretion, consider joint or individual bids from parties who express an interest in acquiring fewer than all of the Debtorsย 4 main regions of operations (North, South, Florida, and the Midwest) (each, a "Region," and collectively, the "Regions") so long as when combined, such bids together would result in the acquisition of all of the Regions for an aggregate purchase price in excess of the Initial Competing Bid, and all of the Assumed Liabilities would be assumed by the various bidders, as applicable (as so combined). 

  

 In any bid for the North Region (separate from a bid for all of the Purchased Assets), the Competing Bidder must indicate whether its bid also includes the Excluded Developments. Alternatively, the Debtors, in their discretion may consider a bid for only the Excluded Developments, solely to the extent that any bid therefor otherwise satisfies all of the other applicable requirements set forth herein for a Qualified Bid. In the event the Debtors receive an otherwise Qualified Bid for only the Excluded Developments that they would, in their discretion, consider acceptable and would not interfere with the Sale of the Purchased Assets or the North Region (as applicable), the Debtors may also submit such bid to the Bankruptcy Court for approval at the Sale Hearing. In the event any bid for the Excluded Assets would entail the assumption and assignment of any contract or lease, the Debtors would provide notice to the applicable non-debtor contract party and an opportunity to object to the proposed Cure Amount. 

  

 Each Competing Bid must fully disclose the identity of all other entities, if any, which shall be acquiring directly or indirectly after the Closing a portion of the Purchased Assets under or in connection with a Bid. Each Competing Bidder is required to confirm that it has not engaged in any collusion with respect to the bidding or the proposed Sale, except that different parties may (with the Debtorsย permission, at their discretion (following a request therefor by the potential joint bidders upon full notification of the entities involved) combine Bids into a joint bid (as described further herein). 

  

 Bids submitted on or prior to the Bidding Deadline, as may be modified by a Bidder at the Auction, shall remain open and irrevocable until the Sale Hearing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Winning Competing Bid and the Second Place Bid shall be deemed to remain open and irrevocable until the closing of the transaction that is the subject of such Bid (subject to the terms and conditions of the APA with respect to the Proposed Buyer). Acceptance of a Qualified Bid shall, in all respects, be subject to the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court that, among other things, authorizes the Debtors to consummate a sale to the Winning Competing Bidder. Following the Sale Hearing, if the Proposed Buyer or any Winning Competing Bidder (as the case may be) fails to consummate an approved sale because of a breach or failure to perform on 

   ##### 

  

 

its part, the next highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid, as disclosed at
the Auction (the "Second Place Bid"), shall be deemed to be the Winning
Competing Bid, and the Debtors shall be authorized, but not required (except
if the Second Place Bid is made by the Proposed Buyer), to consummate the
Sale with the Qualified Bidder submitting such Second Place Bid (i) without
the need for further notice or order of the Bankruptcy Court and (ii) without
prejudice to the Debtorsย right to seek all available damages from the
defaulting bidder (be it the Proposed Buyer or the Winning Competing Bidder
at the Auction, including the party that submits the Second Place Bid, as the
case may be). 

  

4\. _The Auction and Selection of the Winning Bid_  

   

 If one or more Qualified Bids (other than the Proposed Buyerยs) are received by the Bidding Deadline (a "Competing Bid"), the Auction would be conducted at the offices of Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp, Eighty Pine Street, New York, New York 10005-1702, or at another location as may be timely disclosed by the Debtors to the Qualified Bidders, on or about June 23, 2010 starting at 9:30 a.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) (the "Auction Date"). If, however, (i) the only Qualified Bid the Debtors have received by the Bidding Deadline (unless the Debtors have extended such deadline in accordance with the terms of the Bidding Procedures) is the Proposed Buyerยs Qualified Bid as set forth in the APA, then the Auction will not be held, and the Proposed Buyer will be deemed the Winning Bidder, and the Debtors will be authorized to seek approval thereof at the Sale Hearing. 

  

 In the event there is an Auction, all bidders must appear in person or through a duly authorized representative, or else not be eligible or entitled to participate therein. At or prior to the commencement of the Auction, the Debtors will notify the Proposed Buyer and all Qualified Bidders of the then highest and best Qualified Bid received by that time. 

  

 Initial bidding at the Auction shall begin with such then highest and best bid. If more than one Bid is submitted, each such bidder shall have the right to continue to improve its Bid at the Auction. Each subsequent bid (each, a "Subsequent Overbid") must have a purchase price that exceeds the purchase price of the previous highest bid by at least $1,000,000. 

  

 The Auction will continue in one or more rounds of bidding and shall conclude after each participating bidder has had an opportunity to submit an additional Subsequent Overbid, after being advised of the then highest bid and the identity of the party making such next highest bid. Each bid at the Auction must meet each of the criteria of a Qualified Bid, other than the requirement that it be received prior to the Bidding Deadline. All bids shall be placed on the record, which shall either be transcribed or videotaped, and each bidder shall be informed of the terms of the previous bid. 

  

 In considering bids other than the Proposed Buyerยs, the Debtors shall reduce every (i) bidderยs bid for the Purchased Assets, or (ii) combination of individual bids for fewer than all 4 of the Regions (provided that when so combined, all 4 Regions would be the subject of a bid), in each instance by an amount equal to (in the aggregate) the sum of the Termination Fee plus the Expense Reimbursement (or consider any Subsequent Overbid of the Proposed Buyer to be higher by an amount equal to the Termination Fee plus the Expense Reimbursement). The Proposed Buyer shall be entitled to make a revised higher or otherwise better offer at any time during the Auction. 

  

 Upon the conclusion of the Auction, the Debtors shall (i) review each Qualified Bid or bids (as and to the extent such bids were increased at the Auction) on the basis of financial and contractual terms and the factors relevant to the Sale Process, including those factors affecting the speed and certainty of consummating the Sale(s), as well as the Debtorsย liability, if any, for 

   ##### 

  

 

payment of the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement to the Proposed
Buyer, and (ii) identify the highest and otherwise best offer(s) for the
Purchased Assets as the Winning Competing Bid. The Debtors and the entity (or
entities) that made the Winning Competing Bid(s) (each, a "Winning Competing
Bidder") will enter into a definitive agreement(s) (which will be subject
to Court approval) before the Auction is adjourned. The Debtors will submit
the Winning Competing Bid(s) to the Court for approval at the Sale Hearing. 

  

5\. _The Supplement_  

   

 To the extent that the Initial Bid of the Proposed Buyer embodied in the APA is not the Winning Competing Bid at the Auction, the Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court a supplement (the "Supplement") that will inform the Bankruptcy Court of the results of the Auction and the highest or otherwise best bid(s) for the Purchased Assets. The Supplement will identify, among other things, (a) the Winning Competing Bidder(s), as the proposed purchaser(s), (b) the consideration to be paid by such purchaser(s) for the Purchased Assets, and (c) any executory contracts and unexpired leases to be assumed and assigned to the purchaser in connection with the Sale(s) (to the extent different from the Assigned Agreements proposed to be assumed and assigned to the Proposed Buyer under the APA). In addition, the Debtors will attach to the Supplement, as exhibits, (a) any revised proposed order(s) approving the Sale(s), (b) copies of the asset purchase agreement(s) entered into by the Debtors and the Winning Competing Bidder(s), and (c) the Winning Competing Bidderยs Adequate Assurance Package(s). Also, to the extent the Debtors accept a bid for the Excluded Developments at the Auction, they will include in the Supplement (to the extent then available) a copy of a proposed asset purchase agreement and sale order with respect thereto. The Debtors will file and serve the Supplement as promptly as is reasonably practicable prior to the Sale Hearing in accordance with the Notice Procedures and, in any event, to any person who submits a written request therefor to either (a) Cahill Gordon and Reindel llp, Eighty Pine Street, New York, New York 10005-1702, Attn: Joel H. Levitin, Esq. or (b) Elliott Greenleaf, 1105 North Market Street, Suite 1700, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, Attn.: Rafael X. Zahralddin, Esq. 

 

6\. _Notice of Proposed Assignment and Cure Amounts_  

   

 No later than 10 days following the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court and cause to be served on all non-debtor parties to their known executory contracts and unexpired leases a notice (the "Section 365 Notice") that will inform such parties of (A) the possibility that the Debtors may seek to assume, assign, and transfer some or all of their executory contracts and unexpired leases to the Proposed Buyer or to any Winning Competing Bidder in connection with the Sale, and, in particular, will indicate whether or not the Proposed Buyer has already expressed an interest in having that particular contract or lease assigned to it under the APA as an Assigned Agreement, (B) the amount, if any, that the Debtors believe would be required to be paid to cure any monetary default related to each such designated contract or lease if it were so assumed and assigned, in satisfaction of Bankruptcy Code ยง 365(b) (the "Proposed Cure Amount"), and (C) the possibility that the Debtors will seek to reject, at the Sale Hearing, some or all executory contracts and unexpired leases that are not assumed and assigned to a purchaser(s) of the Purchased Assets in connection with a Sale. 

  

 The APA provides, and the agreement from another bidder may also provide, for the Proposed Buyer, or the Winning Competing Bidder (as the case may be), to add or remove Purchased Contracts or Purchased Leases from the Cure Schedule at any time up until Closing. As the Debtors are advised by the Proposed Buyer, or the Winning Competing Bidder (as the case may be), that it desires to assume and assign an executory contract or unexpired lease, the Debtors will file an amended or supplemental Section 365 Notice adding or removing such contracts or leases thereto (any such added contract, an "Additional Contract"), and shall provide notice of 

   ##### 

  

 

the proposed removal of an Assumed Contract or assumption and assignment of
the Additional Contracts to each affected counterparty to such Additional
Contracts. 

  

7\. _Objections_  

   

 Objections, if any, to the remaining relief sought in the Sale Motion must be in writing, stating with particularity the grounds for such objections or other statements of positions, comply with the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and the Local Rules, and be filed and served so as to be _actually received_ by co-counsel to the Debtors, counsel to the Agent, the United States Trustee, co-counsel to the Proposed Buyer, and [proposed] counsel to the Creditors Committee, by 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) on the date that is 7 days prior to the Sale Hearing Date. 

  

 Objections, if any, to the information contained in the Supplement must be in writing, comply with the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and the Local Rules, and be filed and served so as to be _actually received_ by co-counsel to the Debtors, counsel to the Agent, the United States Trustee, and [proposed] counsel to the Creditors Committee, by noon on the date that is one day prior to the Sale Hearing Date. 

  

 Objections, if any, that relate to (i) the proposed assumption and assignment of an Assigned Agreement (including, but not limited to, any objections relating to the validity of the Proposed Cure Amount as determined by the Debtors or otherwise to assert that any amounts, defaults, conditions, or pecuniary losses must be cured or satisfied under any of the assigned executory contracts or unexpired leases, not including accrued but not yet due obligations, in order for such contract to be assumed and/or assigned) or (ii) the rejection of a Rejected Contract, as applicable (a "Section 365 Objection") must be in writing, comply with the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules and the Local Rules, state the basis of such objection with specificity, including, without limitation, the cure amount alleged by such counterparty (if applicable), and include contact information for such counterparty, and be filed and served so as to be actually received by co-counsel to the Debtors, counsel to the Agent, the United States Trustee, co-counsel to the Proposed Buyer, and [proposed] counsel to the Creditors Committee, so that they are _actually received_ by 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) on the date that is 10 days prior to the Sale Hearing Date, or in the case of Additional Contracts, within 10 days after receipt of a Section 365 Notice with respect thereto (as applicable, the "Section 365 Objection Deadline"). 

  

 Unless a Section 365 Objection is filed and served by a party to (a) an Assigned Agreement or a party interested in an Assigned Agreement or (b) a Rejected Contract, as applicable, by the Section 365 Objection Deadline, all interested parties that have received actual or constructive notice thereof shall be deemed to have waived and released any right to assert a Section 365 Objection and to have otherwise consented to either (i) the assignment of the applicable Assigned Agreement and shall be forever barred and estopped from asserting or claiming against the Debtors, the Purchased Assets, the Proposed Buyer, or the Winning Competing Bidder (as the case may be), or any other assignee of the applicable Assigned Agreement, that any additional amounts are due or defaults exist, or conditions to assignment must be satisfied, under such Assigned Agreement for the period prior to the Sale Hearing Date, or (ii) the rejection of a Rejected Contract, as applicable. 

 

8\. _Court Approval_  

   

 A hearing on all of the remaining relief requested in the Sale Motion and to consider the results of the Auction (the "Sale Hearing") will be held before the Honorable Peter J. Walsh, United States Bankruptcy Court Judge, at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 824 Market Street, 6th Floor, Courtroom #2, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, on or about June 24, 2010 at [___:_ __].m.

FORM OF ESCROW DEPOSIT AGREEMENT 

        ##### 

  

     

ESCROW AGREEMENT 
 (Deposit) 

   

 THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (DEPOSIT) (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of April 13, 2010 by and among NVR, INC., a Virginia corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), ORLEANS HOMEBUILDERS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), the individual selling affiliates Parent set forth on  _Exhibit A_ hereto (together with Parent, the " _Sellers_ "), and FIRST AMERICAN TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), and is entered into pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 13, 2010, by and among the Sellers and the Purchaser (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Purchase Agreement. 

  

 _RECITALS_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser has agreed, among other things, at the Closing to purchase, acquire and accept from the Sellers, and the Sellers have agreed to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the Purchaser and its assignees all of the Sellersย right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets in exchange for payment by Purchaser of the Purchase Price; 

  

 WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser has agreed to deliver to the Escrow Agent, in two equal installments as described below, a deposit aggregating SEVENTEEN MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($17,000,000) (the amounts so delivered from time to time, the " _Deposit_ "), which the Escrow Agent has agreed to hold pursuant to the terms hereof; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is agreeable to acting as such upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Escrow Agent_. Sellers and Purchaser hereby engage the Escrow Agent to serve as "Escrow Agent" under the terms hereof pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby accepts such engagement and agrees to hold the Deposit in accordance with the terms hereof. The Deposit (or any portion thereof) shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Wire transfer instructions are attached hereto as  _Schedule 1_. All interest will accrue to and be reported to applicable taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, for the account of Purchaser. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Purchaser agrees to deliver to the Escrow Agent a properly completed W-9 form. 

  

 2. _Deposit_. Purchaser shall deposit the Deposit with the Escrow Agent as follows: 

   

 (i) one half (1/2) of the Deposit shall be deposited on or prior to the first Business Day following the date hereof; and 

   

 (ii) the balance of the Deposit shall be deposited on or prior to the deadline for submitting Qualified Bids. 

 

The Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent and invested in one or more
separate interest-bearing accounts at PNC Bank doing business in the
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania metropolitan area, or as otherwise jointly
directed by Parent and Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall not commingle
the Deposit with any funds of the Escrow Agent or others, and shall promptly
provide Sellers and Purchaser with confirmation of investments made. 

      ##### 

  

     

 3. _Release of Deposit_. 

  

 (a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of joint written instructions of Purchaser and Parent directing the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit, together with any interest accrued thereon, to Purchaser or Parent, as applicable. In the event the Escrow Agent does not receive such joint written instructions, the Deposit shall be held and released pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) below. 

   

 (b) In the event the Closing occurs under the Purchase Agreement, the Deposit, together with any interest accrued thereon, shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. 

   

 (c) In the event Purchaser or any Seller becomes entitled, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, to receipt of the Deposit other than pursuant to _Section 3(a)_ or _Section 3(b)_ above, it shall send a notice thereof (a " _Release Notice_ ") to the other party and to the Escrow Agent. In the event the party receiving the Release Notice disputes the sending partyยs right to receive the Deposit, it shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Release Notice, send a notice of such dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the sending party and to the Escrow Agent. In the event the Escrow Agent does not receive a timely Dispute Notice, it shall send the Deposit to the party that sent the Release Notice following the expiration of the ten (10) day period. In the event the Escrow Agent receives a timely Dispute Notice, it shall continue to hold the Deposit until it either receives the joint written instructions of Purchaser and Parent directing release of the Deposit or until it receives a court order, not subject to appeal, directing disposition of the Deposit. 

   

 4. _Interpleader_. Sellers and Purchaser agree that in the event of any controversy regarding the Deposit, unless mutual written instructions are received by the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of the Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall not take any action, but instead shall await the disposition of any proceeding relating to the Deposit or, at the Escrow Agentยs option, the Escrow Agent may interplead all parties and deposit the Deposit with a court of competent jurisdiction in which event the Escrow Agent may recover all of its court costs and reasonable attorneysย fees. Sellers or Purchaser, whichever loses in any such interpleader action, shall be solely obligated to pay such costs and fees to the Escrow Agent, as well as the reasonable attorneysย fees of the prevailing party in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 5. _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand, (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one (1) Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in each case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to such other address or facsimile number as a party may have specified by notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision):

In the event Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, disputes Purchaserยs right to receive the Released Adjustment Funds specified in the Adjustment Release Notice, Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall, within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the Adjustment Release Notice, send a notice of such dispute (a " _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser or Parent, as applicable, and to the Escrow Agent, including, in the case of Parent, evidence that Parent timely has delivered a Dispute Notice regarding Purchaserยs calculation of the Closing Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.2 of the Purchase Agreement. 

   

 a. In the event the Escrow Agent does not receive a timely Adjustment Dispute Notice, it shall release the specified portion of the Holdback Amount to Purchaser following the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period. 

   

 b. In the event the Escrow Agent receives a timely Adjustment Dispute Notice, it shall continue to hold the Released Adjustment Funds until it either receives the joint written instructions of Purchaser and Parent directing release of the Released Adjustment Funds or until it receives a court order, not subject to appeal, directing disposition of the Released Adjustment Funds. 

  

 (c) [Purchaser may request one or more separate releases by the Escrow Agent of the Environmental Holdback Amount or a portion thereof (any such requested amount, the "Released Environmental Holdback Funds") by requesting, pursuant to Section 2.9 of the Purchase Agreement, reimbursement for Remediation Costs by sending a notice thereof to Parent and the Escrow Agent that specifies the amount of the Environmental Holdback Funds to be released to Purchaser (a "Remediation Release Request"). In the event Parent objects to Purchaserยs request for release of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds, Parent shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of the Remediation Release Request, send a notice of such dispute (a "Remediation Dispute Notice") to Purchaser and to the Escrow Agent, which Remediation Dispute Notice shall specify the amount of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds to which Seller objects. 

   

 a. In the event the Escrow Agent does not receive a timely Remediation Dispute Notice specifying an amount to which Parent objects, the Escrow Agent shall release to Purchaser the Released Environmental Holdback Funds set forth in the Environmental Holdback Release Notice on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the date of the initial reimbursement request. 

   ##### 

  

   

 b. In the event the Escrow Agent receives a timely Remediation Dispute Notice, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Purchaser the portion of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds to which Parent has not objected and shall continue to hold the balance of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds until it either receives the joint written instructions of Purchaser and Parent directing release of such portion of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds or until it receives a court order, not subject to appeal, directing disposition of such portion of the Released Environmental Holdback Funds. 

   

 c. Upon receipt of notice from Purchaser directing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Parent the remaining balance, if any, of the Environmental Holdback Amount, the Escrow Agent shall within five (5) Business Days release to Parent the remaining balance, if any, of the Environmental Holdback Amount, in accordance with Section 2.9(c) of the Purchase Agreement. 

 

A Remediation Dispute Notice shall apply only to the Environmental Holdback
Release Notice in response to which it is given and shall not restrict the
release of any Environmental Holdback Funds that are the subject of a
subsequent Environmental Holdback Release Notice, except to the extent that
Parent sends a timely Remediation Dispute Notice with respect thereto.] 8/ 

   

 (d) Interest accrued on the Holdback Amount shall be released to the Purchaser and/or Parent, as applicable, pro rata in proportion to the portion of the Holdback Amount being released to each such party pursuant to this _Section 3_ and simultaneously with the release thereof. 

  

 4. _Interpleader_. Parent and Purchaser agree that in the event of any controversy regarding the Holdback Amount, unless mutual written instructions are received by the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of the Holdback Amount, the Escrow Agent shall not take any action, but instead shall await the disposition of any proceeding relating to the Holdback Amount or, at the Escrow Agentยs option, the Escrow Agent may interplead all parties and deposit the Holdback Amount with a court of competent jurisdiction in which event the Escrow Agent may recover all of its court costs and reasonable attorneysย fees. Parent or Purchaser, whichever loses in any such interpleader action, shall be solely obligated to pay such costs and fees to the Escrow Agent, as well as the reasonable attorneysย fees of the prevailing party in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 5. _Notices_.

The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Assignment shall not operate or be construed as a waiver or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by Law.
