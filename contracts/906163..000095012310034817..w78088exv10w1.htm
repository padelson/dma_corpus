applicable, Purchaser, may, at its option, include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not
material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items are
material except to the extent a particular representation is qualified by materiality, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this

Closing Adjustment, by the amount of any Qualified Development Costs paid from the amounts so
drawn, and (ii)&nbsp;by the amount so drawn, so long as such amounts are held in the form of cash or

all costs, expenses, liabilities and causes of action (including, without limitation, court costs
and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) resulting from any draws on Sellers&#146; Commitments on or after the

accepted by the appropriate Governmental Body and Sellers&#146; Commitments have been returned to
Sellers and the Sellers&#146; Agreements have been terminated and canceled; <U>provided</U> that, if
the events giving rise to such draws occurred prior to the Closing Date, the amounts so drawn are
held in the form of cash or used to pay Qualified Development Costs. At the Closing, Sellers shall

subsequently drawn and held by, the beneficiaries of the Commitments. In the event that, following
Closing, Sellers receive any cash payments in respect of Commitments drawn by a beneficiary at or
prior to or following Closing, Seller shall promptly pay the amount so received to Purchaser. This

provided to Escrow Agent a schedule allocating the Base Purchase Price to each Individual Property.
Escrow Agent shall maintain the confidentiality of such allocations and not disclose them except

Individual Property cannot be conveyed to Purchaser, or that there is a material risk that any
Individual Property cannot be conveyed to Purchaser, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser shall deliver a joint written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow
Agent shall disclose to the parties the allocation assigned to such Individual Property and, if
such disclosure is made prior to conclusion of any auction pursuant to the Bidding Procedures
Order, Parent shall be entitled to disclose the adjustment to the Purchase Price that would result

the Proposed Buyer is unwilling to remain obligated to consummate the Transactions or otherwise be
bound under the APA (including the obligations to maintain its committed offer while such offer is

Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement induced the Proposed Buyer to submit a bid that will
serve as a minimum or floor bid at the Auction on which the Debtors, their creditors, and other
bidders can rely. The Proposed Buyer has provided a material benefit to the Debtors and their
creditors by increasing the likelihood that the best possible purchase price for the Purchased
Assets will be received. Accordingly, the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement provide an
actual benefit to the Debtors&#146; estates, are necessary to preserve the Debtors&#146; estates, represent
the best method for maximizing value for the benefit of the Debtors&#146; estates, and are reasonable

satisfy the balance of the proposed purchase price or to provide any other consideration to be
given in connection with the Sale); (c)&nbsp;provide a bid letter including a statement that it is
willing to proceed as a buyer on a basis substantially similar to that of the Proposed Buyer with
respect to the Purchased Assets and/or the Region(s) that is the subject of the Bid (including with
respect to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, or to the extent the Bid is for fewer than

the Debtors and their professionals; and (e)&nbsp;provide an earnest money deposit of equal to 10% of
the amount of its bid, upon submission of the Bid (the &#147;Bid Deposit&#148;). The Debtors may request
additional information from a Competing Bidder in order to evaluate the bidder&#146;s ability to
consummate a transaction and to fulfill its obligations in connection therewith, and such bidder

The Bid Deposit, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to any Bidder whose
Bid is not accepted by the Debtors within 3 business days of the conclusion of the Sale Hearing,

Winning Competing Bid (as such term is defined below) fails to consummate the purchase of the
Purchased Assets, and such failure to consummate the purchase or purchases is the result of a
breach by the Winning Competing Bidder, such bidder&#146;s Bid Deposit shall be forfeited to the Debtors

applicable requirements set forth herein for a Qualified Bid. In the event the Debtors receive an
otherwise Qualified Bid for only the Excluded Developments that they would, in their discretion,
consider acceptable and would not interfere with the Sale of the Purchased Assets or the North
Region (as applicable), the Debtors may also submit such bid to the Bankruptcy Court for approval
at the Sale Hearing. In the event any bid for the Excluded Assets would entail the assumption and

to the Escrow Agent, in two equal installments as described below, a deposit aggregating SEVENTEEN
MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($17,000,000) (the amounts so delivered from time to time, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is agreeable to acting as such upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

hereinafter contained, the parties hereby agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Escrow Agent</U>. Sellers and Purchaser hereby engage the Escrow Agent to serve as
&#147;Escrow Agent&#148; under the terms hereof pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1 of the Purchase Agreement. The
Escrow Agent hereby accepts such engagement and agrees to hold the Deposit in accordance with the
terms hereof. The Deposit (or any portion thereof) shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. Wire transfer instructions are attached hereto as
<U>Schedule&nbsp;1</U>. All interest will accrue to and be reported to applicable taxing authorities,
including the Internal Revenue Service, for the account of Purchaser. Simultaneously with the
execution and delivery hereof, Purchaser agrees to deliver to the Escrow Agent a properly completed
W-9 form.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Deposit</U>. Purchaser shall deposit the Deposit with the Escrow Agent as follows:

reasonable attorneys&#146; fees. Sellers or Purchaser, whichever loses in any such interpleader action,
shall be solely obligated to pay such costs and fees to the Escrow Agent, as well as the reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees of the prevailing party in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

either of the parties, and that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to either of the parties for
any act or omission on its part taken or made in good faith, and not in disregard of this Agreement
and/or the Purchase Agreement, but shall be liable for its negligent acts and willful misconduct

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and hold
it harmless against all costs, claims and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable

hereunder, except with respect to actions or omissions taken or made by the Escrow Agent in bad
faith, in disregard of this Agreement or involving negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in acting on and relying upon any written
notice, instruction, direction or other document which the Escrow Agent in good faith believes to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or
question as to the construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or its duties hereunder,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties hereunder at any time by
giving written notice of such resignation to Sellers and Purchaser specifying a date, not less than
fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the date of such notice, when such resignation will take effect. Upon the
effective date of such resignation, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the funds held in escrow to such
person or persons as Parent and Purchaser shall in writing jointly direct, and upon such delivery
the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all duties and liabilities thereafter accruing under this
Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall have the right at any time upon joint action to substitute a
new Escrow Agent by giving notice thereof to the Escrow Agent then acting.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same original.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;<U>Attorney&#146;s Fees</U>. Should any party employ attorneys to enforce any of the

party or parties all reasonable costs, charges and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees,
expended or incurred in connection therewith.
</DIV>

benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this
Assignment shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person or
entity not a party to this Assignment except as provided in the Purchase Agreement. In the event
that a Chapter&nbsp;11 trustee should be appointed for Parent, or in the event that Parent&#146;s Chapter&nbsp;11
