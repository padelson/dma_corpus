This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT is dated as of February 8, 2017 (this "

and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer_ _Bank_ "), Clayton HC, Inc.,
a Tennessee corporation (" _Seller_ "), Clayton Bank and Trust, a Tennessee
state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (" _CBT_ "), American City
Bank, a Tennessee state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (" _ACB_
"), and James L. Clayton, a significant shareholder of Seller (" _Clayton_ ").
Each of CBT and ACB are referred to herein as a " _Seller_ _Bank_ " and,
together, as the " _Seller_ _Banks_." Each of Seller, CBT and ACB are
referred to herein as a " _Seller_ _Entity_ " and, together, as the " _Seller_
_Entities_."

 

 _W I T N E S S E T H_

 

WHEREAS, Seller owns (1) all the issued and outstanding shares (the " _CBT_
_Shares_ ") of common stock, $25.00 par value per share, of CBT (the " _CBT_
_Common_ _Stock_ "), and (2) all of the issued and outstanding shares (the "
_ACB_ _Shares_ ", and, together with CBT Shares, the " _Bank_ _Shares_ ") of
common stock, $362.092 par value per share, of ACB (the " _ACB_ _Common_
_Stock_ ", and, together with CBT Common Stock, the " _Bank_ _Common_ _Stock_
");

WHEREAS, Seller wishes to sell to Buyer Bank, and Buyer Bank wishes to
purchase from Seller, the Bank Shares, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein (the " _Stock_ _Purchase_ ");

 

WHEREAS, Clayton and the Clayton Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(the " _Seller_   _ESOP_ _"_ and together with Clayton, the " _Shareholders_
", and each a " _Shareholder_ ") own all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of the Seller;

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement
and to prescribe certain conditions thereto; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire that capitalized terms used herein shall have the
definitions ascribed to such terms when they are first used herein or as
otherwise specified in ARTICLE X hereof.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

 

Section 1.01 _Purchase and Sale of the Bank Shares_. On and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Seller shall
sell, and Buyer Bank shall purchase, all of Sellers right, title, and
interest in and to the Bank Shares. Seller shall transfer and convey, and
Buyer Bank shall purchase, the Bank Shares free and clear of any and all
Liens. 

 



1 Section 1.02 _Buyer Payments_. Seller shall receive the following
consideration from Buyer and Buyer Bank as consideration for the Bank Shares:

(a) 5,860,000 shares of Buyers common stock (the " _Stock_ _Consideration_
"), $1.00 par value per share (the " _Buyer_ _Common_ _Stock_ ").

 

(b) Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000) in aggregate principal amount of Buyer
Banks 5.5% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Note due 2027 (the " _Debt_
_Consideration_ ", and together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Buyer_  
_Consideration_ "), in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_.

Section 1.03  _Pre-Closing Return of Capital_. Seller shall receive the
following return of capital from the Seller Banks at or prior to the Closing:

 

(a) _Cash_ _Dividend_. Special cash dividend of Seventy-Nine Million Dollars
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($79,500,000) (the " _Special_ _Cash_
_Dividend_ ") from the Seller Banks to the Seller paid as set forth and in
accordance with _Section 5.24(c)_. If the Seller Banks are unable to make the
entire Special Cash Dividend to the Seller (following the distributions
contemplated by _Sections 5.24(a)-(b)_ ) solely (i) as a result of the failure
of the Seller Banks to obtain Regulatory Approval to exceed statutory maximum
dividend payment amounts with respect to the Special Cash Dividend or (ii)
because such Special Cash Dividend would be prohibited under the liquidity
policies of the Seller Banks as of the date hereof (true and correct copies of
which have been provided to the Buyer and the Buyer Bank), the Buyer Bank, or
the Governmental Authorities with respect to maintaining a deposit account in
the Seller Banks or the Buyer Bank in such amount on behalf of the Seller when
paid or after the Closing (such restrictions in clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Special_ _Cash_ _Dividend_ _Restrictions_ "), then the Seller Banks shall
distribute to Seller the maximum amount of cash permitted to be distributed to
Seller under the Special Cash Dividend Restrictions (the " _Permissible_
_Cash_ _Dividend_ _Amount_ ") and Buyer or Buyer Bank shall pay to Seller an
amount at Closing equal to the amount of the Special Cash Dividend _less_ the
Permissible Cash Dividend Amount (the " _Special_ _Cash_ _Dividend_ _Make-
Whole_ _Payment_ ").

 

(b) _Asset_ _Dividend_. Special asset dividend from the Seller Banks to Seller
as set forth and in accordance with _Section 5.24(b)_.

Section 1.04 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Buyer Bank shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Seller Entity, its
respective Subsidiaries and its respective officers and directors shall be
deemed to have granted to Buyer and Buyer Bank, and each or any of them, an
irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official
corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any
other acts as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of Buyer and Buyer Bank, as
applicable, are authorized in the name of each Seller Entity and its
respective Subsidiaries or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 



2 Section 1.05 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, Seller Banks will be merged with and into
Buyer Bank upon the terms and with the effect set forth in the Plan of Bank
Merger (Buyer Bank, as the surviving entity in the Bank Merger, sometimes
being referred to herein as the " _Surviving_ _Entity_ "), substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Bank_ _Merger_ ").

 

Section 1.06 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Buyer Bank may at any
time and without the approval of any Seller Entity change the method of
effecting the Bank Merger contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent
that it deems such a change to be desirable; _provided,_ _however_ , that no
such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of the Buyer Consideration
or (ii) reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay consummation of
the Stock Purchase. In the event that Buyer Bank elects to make such a change,
the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.

enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that validity
and enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity or by
principles of public policy and except where the failure to be valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had, a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) each Seller Bank has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it

giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default, except to the
extent that such default or event of default has not had, and is not
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. No power of attorney or
similar authorization given directly or indirectly by any Seller Bank is

13  will in the future restrict, the conduct of a Seller Banks business or that

(a) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.16(a)_ sets forth a list of each Employee
Benefit Plan currently or previously adopted, maintained, sponsored in whole
or in part, or contributed to by any of the Seller Entities or their
Subsidiaries or under which any of the Seller Entities have any obligation or

Neither the Seller Entities nor any of their Subsidiaries nor their ERISA
Affiliates have any stated plan, intention or commitment to establish any new
Employee Benefit Plan or has made any specific commitment to modify any
Seller Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by Law).

(b) Seller Entities have made available to Buyer Bank true and complete

trust instruments and other funding arrangements, including insurance
contracts, forming a part of any Seller Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, (ii) summary plan descriptions and summary of material
modifications, (iii) IRS Form 5500 (for the three (3) most recently completed
plan years), (iv) the most recent IRS determination, opinion, notification and
advisory letters, with respect thereto and including any correspondence from
any regulatory agency and (v) non-discrimination testing data and results

recently completed plan years, any plan financial statements and accompanying
accounting reports, service contracts, fidelity bonds and
required participant annual notices,) have been made available to Buyer Bank.

(c) All Seller Benefit Plans are in material compliance in form and operation
with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code in all respects. All
Seller Benefit Plans have been administered in accordance with their terms in
all respects. Each Seller Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Seller_ _401(a)_ _Plan_ "), has received
a favorable determination letter from the IRS, or is maintained under a
prototype or volume submitter document and is entitled to rely on a favorable
opinion or advisory letter from the IRS, and neither Seller nor either Seller
Bank is aware of any circumstance that could reasonably be

 



14  expected to result in revocation of any such favorable determination,
opinion, or advisory letter or the loss of the qualification of such Seller
401(a) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to result in the Seller 401(a) Plan ceasing to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. No Seller 401(a) Plan has been
submitted under or been the subject of an IRS voluntary compliance program
submission that is still outstanding or that has not been fully corrected in
accordance with a compliance statement issued by the IRS with respect to any
applicable failures.

 

(d) There is no pending or, to Seller Entities Knowledge, threatened
litigation or regulatory action relating to the Seller Benefit Plans (other
than routine claims for benefits). There are no audits, investigations,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to Seller Entities Knowledge, threatened
by the IRS or the U.S. Department of Labor with respect to any Seller
Benefit Plan.

(e) None of the Seller Entities have engaged in a transaction with respect to
any Seller Benefit Plan, including a Seller 401(a) Plan that could reasonably
be expected to subject Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Seller
Banks, to a material tax or material penalty under any Law including, but not
limited to, Sections 4980H or 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

(f) No liability under Title IV of ERISA or Code Section 412 has been or is
expected to be incurred by any Seller Entity or any ERISA Affiliate. No
Seller Entity or any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Seller Entity, or any ERISA
Affiliate has sponsored, maintained, contributed to (or been obligated to
contribute to) (i) a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA Section
3(35), (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or (iii) a "multiple employer plan" (meaning a plan sponsored by more

time. No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA has been required to be filed for any Seller Benefit Plan or by any
ERISA Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Seller Benefit
Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the consolidated
financial statements of Seller or Seller Banks.

(h) Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.16(h)_ , no Seller
Benefit Plan provides and the Seller Entities have not proposed or promised
any arrangement that provides for any liability to provide life insurance,
medical or other employee welfare benefits to any Seller Bank Employee, or any
of their affiliates, upon his or her retirement or termination of employment
for any reason, except as may be required by Law.

(i) Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.16(_ _i_ _)_ or
otherwise provided for in this Agreement, neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) entitle any Seller
Bank Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
(except as required by Law) or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or

 



15  benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Seller Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any
breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Seller Benefit Plans,
(iv) result in any payment that would be an excess "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code, or (v) limit or restrict the right of Seller or either Seller Bank or,
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Seller Benefit
Plans.

 

(j) Each Seller Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred compensation
plan or arrangement within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and any
underlying award, is in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A
of the Code. No payment or award that has been made to any participant under a
Seller Benefit Plan is subject to the interest and penalties specified in
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Neither Seller or either Seller Bank nor
any of their Subsidiaries (i) has agreed to reimburse or indemnify any
participant in a Seller Benefit Plan for any of the interest and the
penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be currently
due or triggered in the future, or (ii) has been required to report to any
Government Authority any correction or taxes due as a result of a failure to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(k) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.16(k)_ contains a schedule showing the
monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such schedule, whether
individually or in the aggregate (including good faith estimates of all
amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date of this
Agreement, such as change-in-control payments based, in part, upon incentive
payments earned in 2016 but payable in January 2017), under any employment,
change-in-control, severance or similar contract, plan or arrangement with or
which covers any present or former director, officer, employee or consultant
of either Seller Bank or any of their Subsidiaries who may be entitled to any
such amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind
benefits due under any Seller Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions
in such schedule and providing estimates of other required contributions to
any trusts for any related fees or expenses.

 

(l) All individuals participating in (or eligible to participate in) the
Seller Benefit Plans are common law employees of the Seller or Seller Banks
or their ERISA Affiliates.

Section 3.17 _Labor Matters_. No Seller Bank is a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor organization, nor is there any proceeding pending
or, to Seller Entities Knowledge threatened, asserting that any Seller Bank
has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National
Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel any Seller Bank to bargain with any
labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any
strike or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to Seller Entities
Knowledge, threatened, nor is any Seller Entity aware of any activity
involving Seller Bank Employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining
unit or engaging in other organizational activity. Seller Entities have
correctly classified all individuals who directly or indirectly perform
services for Seller Banks for purposes of federal and state unemployment
compensation Laws, workers compensation Laws and the rules and regulations
of the U.S. Department of Labor.

to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of
Code Section 6662\. Other than a Tax allocation or sharing agreement between
Seller and Seller Banks, neither Seller nor any Seller Bank is a party to or

combined income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which
was Seller), and (ii) has no liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than Seller and its Subsidiaries) under Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or

(j) For Federal and all applicable state income tax purposes, Seller (and any
predecessor of Seller) has been a validly electing S Corporation within the
meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362 at all times, and will be such an S
Corporation up to and including the Closing Date.

 

(k) For Federal and all applicable state income tax purposes, each Seller Bank

all times, and will be such a Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiary up to and
including the Closing Date.

the acquired assets was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the
Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of the
transferor or (ii) acquired the stock of any corporation that is a qualified
subchapter S subsidiary.

 

Section 3.20 _Investment Securities and Commodities_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller Banks, each Seller Bank has good title to all securities and
commodities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase agreements or held
in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any Liens, except to
the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the Ordinary
Course of Business to secure obligations of such Seller Bank. Such securities
and commodities are valued on the books of Seller Banks in accordance with
GAAP in all material respects.

 

(b) Each Seller Bank and its business employ and have acted in compliance in
all material respects with investment, securities, commodities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures (the " _Policies,_
_Practices_ _and_ _Procedures_ ") that are prudent and reasonable in the
context of such businesses. Before the date hereof, each Seller Bank has made
available to Buyer Bank in writing the material Policies, Practices and
Procedures.

(c) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.20(c)_ sets forth as of December 31, 2016,
the Investment Securities, as well as any purchases or sales of Investment
Securities between December 31, 2016 to and including the date hereof,

descriptions thereof, CUSIP numbers, designations as securities "available for
sale" or securities "held to maturity" (as those terms are used in ASC 320),
book values, fair values and coupon rates, and any gain or loss with respect
to any Investment Securities sold during such time period after December 31,
2016. Neither Seller Bank owns any of the

 



20  outstanding equity of any savings bank, savings and loan association,
savings and loan holding company, credit union, bank or bank holding company,
Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, insurance company, mortgage or loan
broker or any other financial institution.

Section 3.21 _Derivative Transactions_.

 

(a) All Derivative Transactions entered into by a Seller Bank or for the
account of any of its customers were entered into in the Ordinary Course of
Business and in accordance with prudent banking practice and in accordance
with applicable Laws and regulatory policies of any Governmental Authority,
and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by such
Seller Bank, and were entered into with counterparties believed at the time to
be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in
consultation with its advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative
Transactions. All of such Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding
obligations of each Seller Bank enforceable against it in accordance with
their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
subject to general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect.
Each Seller Bank has duly performed all of their obligations under
the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued, and, to Seller Entities Knowledge, there are no breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.

 

(b) Each Derivative Transaction is listed in _Disclosure Schedule Section
3.21(b)_ , and the financial position of a Seller Bank under or with respect
to each has been reflected in the books and records of such Seller Bank in
accordance with GAAP, and no open exposure of Seller Banks with respect to any
such instrument (or with respect to multiple instruments with respect to
any single counterparty) exists, except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.21(b)_.

(c) No Derivative Transaction, were it to be a Loan held by a Seller Bank,
would be classified as "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List," as such terms are defined by the FDICs uniform loan classification
standards, or words of similar import.

 

Section 3.22 _Regulatory Capitalization_. Each Seller Bank is "well-
capitalized," as such term is defined in the rules and regulations
promulgated by the FDIC and the Tennessee Department of Financial
Institutions. Seller is "well-capitalized," as such term is defined in the
rules and regulations promulgated by the FRB. There has not been any event
or occurrence that would result in a determination that either Seller Bank is
not both "well capitalized" and "well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal
banking law.

 

Section 3.23 _Loans; Nonperforming and Classified Assets_.

 

(a) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(a)_ identifies any written loan, loan
agreement, note or borrowing arrangement and other extensions of credit
(including, without limitation, leases, credit enhancements, commitments,

(collectively, " _Loans_ "), under the terms of which the obligor was over
sixty (60) days delinquent in payment of principal or interest as of December

).

 



45 (c) Seller Bank Employees (other than those listed in _Seller Disclosure
Schedule 5.12(c)_  who are parties to an employment, change-of-control or
other type of agreement which provides for severance) as of the date of the

maintain for the benefit of the Seller Bank Employees the Benefit Plans
maintained by Seller Entities immediately prior to the Effective Date (it
being understood that participation in the Buyer Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Benefit Plan); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this provision shall not apply to (i) any Seller Benefit Plan that was
terminated or in which participation was frozen on or prior to the Effective
Date or (ii) the Clayton Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan. To the
extent allowable under any Buyer Benefit Plan, Seller Bank Employees shall be
given credit for prior service or employment with applicable Seller Bank for
purposes of eligibility and vesting in all Buyer Benefit Plans, including
service with any predecessor companies or banks, and eligible for any
increased benefits under such plans that would apply to such employees as if

otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in
each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(h) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _
5.12_, Buyer Bank shall assume and honor, and Buyer Bank shall be obligated to
perform, all employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or
"change-in-control" agreements, plans or policies of Seller Banks, but only if
such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in

with the respective covenants and agreements of such parties set forth herein.

__ _ 5.20_, Seller Entities shall not incur any investment banking,
brokerage, finders or other similar financial advisory fees in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than those expressly
set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.36_.

Section 5.21 _Confidentiality_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the consummation of the Stock Purchase, each of Seller and Buyer, and
their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
employees, consultants and advisors have provided, and will continue to
provide one another with information which may be deemed by the party
providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or confidential,
including but not limited to trade secrets of the disclosing party. Each
party hereto agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to, hold
any information obtained pursuant to this ARTICLE V in accordance with the
terms of the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, dated as of April
22, 2016, and December 9, 2016, between Buyer and Seller.

 

Section 5.22 _Allocation of Buyer Consideration_. Seller has represented that
for Federal and applicable state income tax purposes each Seller Bank is a
Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiary within the meaning of Code Section
1361(b)(3)(B). Therefore, it is intended that the Stock Purchase be treated
for Federal and applicable state income tax purposes as the sale of assets
owned by Seller (the " _Acquired_ _Assets_ "). Within ninety (90) calendar
days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare a proposed allocation
(the " _Allocation_ _Schedule_ ") of the Buyer Consideration and other
capitalizable costs among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Code Section
1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The Allocation Schedule shall
become final and binding on the parties hereto thirty (30) calendar days
after Buyer provides such schedule to Seller, unless Seller objects in writing
to Buyer. If Seller does object, Buyer and Seller shall in good faith attempt
to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days of written notice to
Buyer of Sellers objection. Any such resolution shall be final and binding on
the parties. Any unresolved disputes shall be promptly submitted to an
accountant chosen jointly by Buyer and Seller (the " _Arbitrating_
_Accountant_ ") for determination, with such determination being final and
binding on the parties. Buyer and Seller will each pay one-half of the fees
and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other and the Arbitrating Accountant in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_, including, without limitation,
by furnishing such information and access to books, records (including,
without limitation, accountants work papers), personnel and properties as may
be reasonably requested. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with an
allocation that is final and binding under this _Section_ __ _ 5.22_ unless
otherwise required to do so by applicable law.

 

Section 5.23 _Notice of Non-Renewal_. To avoid the costs and expenses
associated with terminating certain Seller Material Contracts, applicable
Seller Entity shall have provided written notice to the vendors set forth in
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.23_, notifying such vendors, by the date
specified, of such Seller Entitys intent not to renew the applicable
agreement as set forth in such schedule and shall negotiate with such vendor,
in coordination with Buyer Bank, any necessary continued use agreements needed
until conversion. In the event that (w) a Seller Entity has provided the
written notices required under this _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ in a timely manner
as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.23_ , (x) the Stock Purchase has
not been consummated by the 

 



51  Expiration Date (provided that the failure of the Closing to occur by such
date shall not be due to any material breach of this Agreement by a Seller
Entity), (y) Seller Entities, in coordination with Buyer Bank, have
negotiated and entered into extensions or amendments to the agreements
identified in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.23_ necessary in order to
continue to receive the services of the applicable vendor until
conversion, and (z) such extensions, amendments or continued use agreements
increase Seller Entities current monthly cost, as set forth on _Seller
Disclosure Schedule 5.23_ as of the date hereof, then to the extent that such
increased monthly costs are directly related to the continued use of such
agreements after their respective expiration date, Buyer Bank agrees to
reimburse Seller for the additional cost incurred by Seller during the period
beginning after the Expiration Date through the Closing Date or the date this
Agreement is terminated, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer Bank shall have no obligation to make any payments or reimbursements to
Seller under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ if a Seller Entity terminates this
Agreement for any reason.

Section 5.24 _Seller Bank Distributions_. The Sellers Banks shall make the
following distributions to the Seller:

(a) _2017 Taxable Earnings Distribution_. 

(i) _Estimated 2017 Tax Distribution_. No later than five Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a consolidated income
statement of the Seller Bank for the period ended on the last completed month
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Measurement_ _Period_ "), which represents
Sellers good faith estimate of the income statement of the Seller Banks for
the Measurement Period (the " _Estimated_ _Income_ _Statement_ "), together
with a summary statement (together with the Estimated Income Statement, the "
_Estimated_ _Tax_ _Distribution_ _Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good
faith estimate of the 2017 Taxable Income and the resulting 2017 Tax
Distribution (the " _Estimated_ _2017_ _Tax_ _Distribution_ "). The Seller

Taxable Income and the 2017 Tax Distribution. Within twenty-one (21) days
after Buyer delivers the Preliminary Tax Distribution Statement to Seller,
Seller shall complete its review of the Preliminary Tax Distribution
Statement. If Seller wishes to object to the contents of the Preliminary Tax
Distribution Statement, then Seller shall inform Buyer on or prior to the last
day of such twenty-one (21) day period by delivering a written notice to Buyer
(a " _Tax_ _Distribution_ _Statement_ _Objection_ ") setting forth a
specific description of the basis of the Tax Distribution Statement Objection
and Sellers proposed adjustments to the preliminary 2017 Taxable Income and
the 2017 Tax Distribution. If Seller does not deliver a Tax Distribution
Statement 

 



52  Objection to Buyer within such twenty-one (21) day period, then the
Preliminary Tax Distribution Statement and the items reflected thereon shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers and shall become final and binding
upon the Parties, absent fraud.

(iii)  _Resolution Following Tax Distribution Statement Objection_. If Seller
timely delivers a Tax Distribution Statement Objection to Buyer in accordance
with Section 5.24(a)(ii), then Seller and Buyer shall resolve in good faith
any dispute or disagreement relating to the Preliminary Tax Distribution
Statement and set forth in the Tax Distribution Statement Objection (the "
_Tax_ _Distribution_ _Statement_ _Dispute_ ") and agree in writing on the
final 2017 Taxable Income and the 2017 Tax Distribution.

(iv) _Final Tax Distribution Statement_. The 2017 Tax Distribution and each
of the components thereof shall be deemed final for the purposes of this
Agreement upon the earliest of (x) the failure of Seller to deliver a Tax
Distribution Statement Objection within twenty-one (21) days after Buyer
delivers the Preliminary Tax Distribution Statement to Seller pursuant to
Section 5.24(a)(ii) or (y) the resolution of all Tax Distribution Statement
Disputes pursuant to Section 5.24(a)(iii) by Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall,
if necessary, revise the Preliminary Tax Distribution Statement, including the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, to reflect the final determination of
the 2017 Tax Distribution in accordance with Section X(c) (as so adjusted,
the " _Final_ _Tax_ _Distribution_ _Statement_ "). After the determination of
the Final Tax Distribution Statement pursuant to this Section 5.24(a)(iv), no
party shall, have the right to make any claim based on the preparation of the
Final Tax Distribution Statement or the calculation of the 2017 Tax
Distribution.

final determination of the 2017 Tax Distribution in accordance with this
Section 5.24(a)(iv):

i. if the Actual 2017 Tax Distribution exceeds the Estimated 2017 Tax
Distribution, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such
excess; or

ii. if the Actual 2017 Tax Distribution is less than the Estimated 2017 Tax
Distribution, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such
shortfall.

 

(b) _Special Asset Dividend_. Following the date of this Agreement and prior
to Closing Date, the Seller Banks shall distribute the properties and assets
set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.24(b)_ of the Seller Bank to
Seller.

_Senior Indebtedness_ "): (a) all indebtedness of the Issuer for money
borrowed, whether or not evidenced by bonds, debentures, securities, notes or
other written instruments; (b) any deferred obligations of the Issuer for the

creditors, reorganization, restructuring of debt, marshaling of assets and
liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation or winding up of or
relating to the Issuer, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled to be paid in full before any payment shall be

the Senior Indebtedness, the registered holder of this Note, together with
the holders of any obligations of the Issuer ranking on a parity with this
Note, shall be entitled to be paid from the remaining assets of the Issuer the
unpaid principal thereof, and the unpaid interest thereon before any payment
or other distribution, whether in cash, property or otherwise, shall be made
on account of any capital stock or any present or future obligations of the
Issuer ranking junior to this Note (collectively, " _Junior
Subordinated Indebtedness_ "), which includes any obligation that by its
terms is subordinated to this Note.

If there shall have occurred and be continuing (a) a default in any payment
with respect to any Senior Indebtedness or (b) an event of default with
respect to any Senior Indebtedness as a result of which the maturity thereof
is accelerated, unless and until such payment default or event of default
shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no payments
shall be made by the Issuer with respect to this Note. The provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply to any payment with respect to which
the immediately preceding paragraph of this _Section_ __ _ 2_ would be
applicable.

Nothing herein shall impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in
accordance with its terms. Nothing herein shall act to prohibit, limit or
impede the Issuer from issuing additional debt of the Issuer having the same
rank as this Note or which may be junior or senior in rank to this Note.

3\. _Merger and Sale of Assets_. The Issuer shall not merge into another
entity or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default

both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing.

 



4 4\. _Events of Default; Acceleration; Compliance Certificate_. If any of the
following events shall occur and be continuing (each an " _Event of Default_
"):

(a) the Issuer shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
shall consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee or other
similar official in any liquidation, insolvency or similar proceeding with
respect to the Issuer or all or substantially all of its property, or shall

business of the Issuer and such decree or order shall have remained in force
for 60 days;

 

then, and in each such case, unless the principal of this Note already shall
have become due and payable, the Noteholder, by notice in writing to the
Issuer, may declare the principal amount of this Note to be due and payable
immediately and, upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be
immediately due and payable. The Issuer waives demand, presentment for
payment, notice of nonpayment, notice of protest, and all other notices.

theNoteholder of the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to this
Note, shall mail to the Noteholder, at its addresses shown on in _Section_ __
_ 10_ below, such written notice of Event of Default, unless such Event of
Default shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice as
certified by the Issuer in writing.

Prior to any acceleration of this Note, the Noteholder may waive any past
Event of Default. In addition, the Noteholder may rescind a declaration of
acceleration of this Note before any judgment has been obtained if (i) the
Issuer pays all matured installments of principal of and interest on this
Note (other than installments due by reason of acceleration) and interest on
the overdue installments and (ii) all other Events of Default with respect to
this Note have been cured or waived.

and interest at the rate borne by this Note, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. If the Issuer fails to pay such amount upon such demand, the
Noteholder may, among other things, institute a judicial proceeding for the
collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to
judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Issuer and
collect the amounts adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the property of the Issuer.

   SECTION 3. | _BOARD MATTERS_ 
---|--- 

3.1. _Board of Directors._ Effective as of the Closing Date:

 

(a) _Rights to Designate_. Each Shareholder hereby agrees to vote, or cause to
be voted, all of its Shares, at any annual or special meeting, by written
consent, or otherwise, and will take all Necessary Actions within the
Shareholders control, and Company will take all Necessary Actions within its
control, to cause the authorized number of directors on the Board
of Directors to be established and remain between 7 and 9, with such number
approved pursuant to the Bylaws and Charter, and to elect or appoint or cause
to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors and cause to be continued
in office (subject to Section 4.8):

(i) a number of designees of Ayers determined as follows: (A) up to a majority
of the total number of directors comprising the Board of Directors (the "
_Total Number of Directors_ "), so long as Ayers beneficially owns, directly
or indirectly, more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock;
(B) up to 40% of the Total Number of Directors, in the event that Ayers
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 40%, but less than or
equal to 50%, of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock; (C) up to 30% of
the Total Number of Directors, in the event that Ayers beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, more than 30%, but less than or equal to 40%, of the
then outstanding shares of Common Stock; (D) up to 20% of the Total Number of
Directors, in the event that Ayers beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,

that Ayers beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, at least 5% of the then

Ayers beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, less than 5% of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of calculating the number of
directors that Ayers is entitled to designate pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, any fractional amounts shall automatically be rounded up
to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1 1⁄4 Directors shall equate to two
Directors) and any such calculations shall be made on a pro forma basis,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any increase in the
size of the Board of Directors. In the event that Ayers has nominated less
than the total number of designees that Ayers shall be entitled to nominate
pursuant to this Section 3.1(a), Ayers shall have the right, at any time, to
nominate such additional designees to which he is entitled, in which case,
the Board of Directors shall take all Necessary Action to (x) increase the
size of the Board of Directors as required to enable Ayers to so nominate such
additional designees and (y) designate such additional designees nominated by
Ayers to fill such newly-created vacancies. Each such designee whom Ayers
shall actually nominate pursuant to this Section 3.1(a)(i) and is thereafter
elected to the Board of Directors to serve as a Director shall be referred to
herein as an " _Ayers Designee_ ";

designation rights and (B) such designation is not otherwise prohibited by

Management Interlocks Act and its implementing regulations, a designee of
James Clayton, which designee shall initially be James Clayton and, if James
Clayton is unable or unwilling to serve as a Director, such designee shall be
a designee that is reasonably acceptable to the Board and would qualify as an
independent Director and shall initially be designated no later than thirty
days following the closing of the Clayton Acquisition (as determined in
accordance with applicable NYSE rules and the Companys corporate governance
guidelines) (such designee whom James Clayton shall actually nominate
pursuant to this Section 3.1(a)(ii) and is thereafter elected to the Board of
Directors to serve as a Director shall be referred to herein as a " _Clayton
Designee_ ");

 

(iii) the chief executive officer of Company and its subsidiaries, who
initially shall be Christopher T. Holmes, shall serve on the Board of
Directors of the Company; and

(iv) each additional designee shall be filled as provided in the Charter and
Bylaws.

Company shall cause the individuals designated in accordance with this Section
3.1(a) to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors, shall solicit

at which directors of Company are to be elected, shall recommend that the
shareholders of Company elect to the Board of Directors each such individual
nominated for election at such meeting.

(b) _Initial Ayers Designees_. The initial Ayers Designees pursuant to
the provisions of Section 3.1(a)(i) of this Agreement shall be Ayers, Orrin
H. Ingram, Stuart C. McWhorter, William F. Andrews and Agenia Clark. Any
remaining undesignated Ayers Designees shall be designated by Ayers at such
time as they shall determine.

(c) _Removal and Replacement of Ayers Designees_.

 

(i) Ayers may remove an Ayers Designee by sending a written notice to
Companys Secretary stating the name of the designee to be removed from the
Board of Directors (the " _Removal Notice_ ") and, upon receipt of such notice
by Companys Secretary, such designee shall be deemed to have resigned from
the Board of Directors (and such a designee shall only be removed in such
manner).

(ii) If at any time any Ayers Designee ceases to serve on the Board of
Directors (whether due to death, disability, resignation, removal or
otherwise), Ayers shall designate or nominate a successor to fill the vacancy
created thereby on the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 3.1(a)
of this Agreement, and 

 



7  the Company will take all Necessary Actions within its control, to cause the
designated successor to be elected to fill such vacancy. In the event that
Ayers does not, pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, have the right
to designate an individual to fill such vacancy, then such vacancy shall be
filled as provided in the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

(d) _Removal and Replacement of Clayton Designee_. Following receipt of the
Regulatory Consent and for so long as James Clayton has the right to
designate a Clayton Designee:

(i) James Clayton may remove a Clayton Designee by sending a Removal Notice
with respect to the Clayton Designee and, upon receipt of such notice by
Companys Secretary, such designee shall be deemed to have resigned from the
Board of Directors (and such a designee shall only be removed in such manner).

 

(ii) If at any time any Clayton Designee ceases to serve on the Board of
Directors (whether due to death, disability, resignation, removal or
otherwise), James Clayton shall designate or nominate a successor to fill the
vacancy created thereby no later than thirty days following such vacancy on
the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement,
and the Company will take all Necessary Actions within its control, to cause
the designated successor to be elected to fill such vacancy. In the event that
James Clayton does not, pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement,
have the right to designate an individual to fill such vacancy, then such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

(e) _Expenses_. Each Director shall be entitled to reimbursement from Company
for his or her reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including travel) incurred
in attending any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or
governing body of any subsidiary of Company or any committee thereof.

3.2. _Committees of the Board of Directors._ For so long as the Company
qualifies as a "controlled company" under applicable listing standards and
subject to applicable Law, Ayers shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to designate (a) a majority of the members of any Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee or similar committee of the Board of Directors and (b)
up to two members of any Compensation Committee or similar committee of the
Board of Directors. In the event that the Company no longer qualifies as a
"controlled company" under applicable listing standards, Ayers shall continue
to have the right to designate at least one member of each such committee of
the Board of Directors for so long as permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , Ayers shall cease to have such right to designate a
committee member in the event that Ayers ceases to have the right to designate
a Director pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement.

 

3.3. _Observation Rights_. If the Regulatory Consent is not received, during
the period prior to the Clayton Termination Date, the Company shall invite a
designee of James Clayton, which designee shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Board and shall initially be James Clayton,

 



8  to attend all meetings of its Board of Directors in a nonvoting observer
capacity and, in this respect, shall give such designee copies of all notices,
minutes, consents, and other materials that it provides to its directors;
provided, however, that such designee shall agree to hold in confidence and
trust and to act in a fiduciary manner with respect to all information so
provided; and provided further, that the Company reserves the right to
withhold any information and to exclude such designee from any meeting or
portion thereof if access to such information or attendance at such meeting
could adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and
its counsel or result in disclosure of trade secrets or a conflict of
interest.

3.4. _Additional Management Provisions._

 

(a) The Shareholders and Company hereby agree, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in any other agreement or at law or in equity, that, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, when a Shareholder takes any action under this
Agreement to give or withhold its consent, such Shareholder shall have no duty
(fiduciary or other) to consider the interests of Company and may act
exclusively in its own interest in its capacity as a Shareholder and shall
have only the duty to act in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall in no way affect the obligations of the parties hereto to
comply with the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) The provisions of this Agreement shall be controlling if any such
provisions or the operation thereof conflict with the provisions of Companys
Bylaws. Each of the parties covenants and agrees to take all Necessary Actions
within its control to ensure that the Charter and Bylaws do not, at any time,
conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

(c) For so long as Company qualifies as a "controlled company" under the
applicable listing standards then in effect, Company will elect to be a
"controlled company" for purposes of such applicable listing standards, and
will disclose in its annual meeting proxy statement that it is a "controlled
company" and the basis for that determination. Company and the Shareholders
acknowledge and agree that, as of the date of this Agreement, Company is a
"controlled company." After Company ceases to qualify as a "controlled
company" under applicable listing standards then in effect, Ayers
acknowledges that a sufficient number of its designees will be required to
qualify as "independent directors" to ensure that the Board of Directors
complies with such applicable listing standards in the time periods required
by the applicable listing standards then in effect, and shall discuss and use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon appropriate changes to their
designees consistent with the foregoing.

owning in excess of the number of voting securities of the Company issued to

restructuring, recapitalization or similar extraordinary transaction with
respect to the Company;

the Company;

commencement of such offer (or at any time thereafter at which it publicly
takes a position with respect to such offer), recommend against stockholders
tendering their shares in such offer or (b) the Company enters into a

this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement is material, shall be deemed to have been relied
upon by the other parties and shall remain operative and in full force and
effect after the Closing Date regardless of any investigation. This Agreement
shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

4.3. _Access to Agreement; Amendment and Waiver; Actions of the Board._ Any
party may waive in writing any provision hereof intended for its benefit,
provided, that, in the case of any waiver by Company, such waiver is consented
to in writing by each Shareholder; provided, however, that if any Shareholder
dies, is Permanently Disabled or ceases to own 5% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock then such Shareholders consent shall not
be required for any waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies that may be available to any party at law or in
equity or otherwise. This Agreement may be amended with the prior written
consent of the Company and each Shareholder; provided, however, that if any
Shareholder dies, is Permanently Disabled or ceases to own 5% or more of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock this Agreement may be amended without such
Shareholders consent.

4.6.  _Remedies; Severability._ It is specifically understood and agreed that
any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by any party will result in

injunctive relief (to the extent permitted at law or in equity). If any one
or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof in any
circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for

not to be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the
rights and privileges of the parties be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law.

expression of their agreement as to the subject matter hereof and, together
with the Bylaws and the Charter, intended to be complete and exclusive
statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to
that subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings
among the parties hereto with regard to such subject matter.

(iii) [●]1 (such earlier date, the "Clayton Termination Date").

4.9.  _Governing Law._ This Agreement is to be construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee, without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would require or permit
the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

4.10. _Successors and Assigns; Beneficiaries._ This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and the respective
successors and assigns of the parties as contemplated herein, and shall also

any Shareholder dies, is Permanently Disabled or ceases to own 5% or more of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock the consent of such Shareholder shall
not be required. Any successor to Company by way of merger or otherwise must

delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or the
negotiation, breach, validity, termination or performance hereof and thereof
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and agrees that it will
not bring any such action in any court other than the federal or state courts
located in Nashville, Tennessee. Each party further irrevocably waives any
objection to proceeding in such courts based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction or to the laying of venue in such courts and further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to make a claim that such courts
are an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
service of process by registered mail at the address to which notices are to

PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING

Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other, and at the
request of any other party, to execute and deliver any further instruments or
documents and to take all such further action as any other party may
reasonably request in order to evidence or effectuate the provisions of
this Agreement and to otherwise carry out the intent of the parties
hereunder.

4.13. _Regulatory Matters._ Company shall and shall cause its subsidiaries to
keep the Shareholders informed, on a current basis, of any events,
discussions, notices or changes with respect to any criminal or regulatory
