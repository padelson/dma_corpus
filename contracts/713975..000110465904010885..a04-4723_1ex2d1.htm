Share Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that any shares of Sun
Common Stock that are owned by any trust created under Suns Defined

agrees to pay the Cash Merger Consideration and the Stock

fraction of the share of Omega Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled multiplied by the Determination Price. No Person
entitled to receive a fractional share of Omega Common Stock will be entitled
to dividends, voting rights or any other rights of a shareholder of Omega

the Effective Time, (ii) has been granted pursuant to Suns 1998 Stock
Incentive Plan or 1998 Independent Directors Stock Option Plan or the Sentry

of Omega Common Stock on the terms set forth below (each Sun Option as
substituted, an "Omega Option").

  



  

(ii) An Omega Option shall be a stock option to acquire shares of Omega
Common Stock with the following terms: (i) the number of shares of Omega
Common Stock which may be acquired pursuant to such Omega Option shall be
equal to the product of the number of shares of Sun Common Stock covered by
the corresponding Sun Option multiplied by 0.664, provided that any
fractional share of Omega Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; (ii) the exercise price per
share of Omega Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Omega Option shall
be equal to the exercise price of the corresponding Sun Option immediately
prior to the conversion thereof to an Omega Option, divided by 0.664,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
cent; (iii) the duration and other terms of such Omega Option shall be
identical to the duration and other terms of the corresponding Sun Option
immediately prior to the conversion thereof to an Omega Option, except that
all references to Sun shall be deemed to be references to Omega and
its affiliates, where the context so requires and shall remain exercisable
until the stated expiration date of the corresponding Sun Option; (iv) Omega
shall assume such Sun Option, whether vested or not vested, as contemplated
by the Code; and (v) to the extent Sun Options qualify as incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Code, the Omega Options exchanged therefor
shall also so qualify.

  



  

(iii) On or within 15 days after the Effective Time, Omega shall take
appropriate action to reserve for issuance and, if not previously registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, register the number of shares of Omega Common
Stock necessary to satisfy Omegas obligations with respect to the issuance
of Omega Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Omega Options.

  



  

13      
   



  

##### (e) _Calculation Schedule_. The calculations of the respective amounts
of cash and Omega Common Stock payable and issuable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and approved by
Omega and Sun as soon as practicable and no later than the Effective Time.

  

##### 

  

#### 2.3 _Election and Allocation Procedures_.

  

#### 

  

##### (a) _Election by Sun Shareholders_. Subject to and in accordance with
the allocation and election procedures set forth herein, each Sun Shareholder
shall, prior to the Election Deadline, specify (i) the number of whole shares
of Sun Common Stock held by such Shareholder as to which such Shareholder
shall desire to receive the Cash Merger Consideration, and (ii) the number of
whole shares of Sun Common Stock held by such Shareholder as to which such
Shareholder shall desire to receive the Stock Merger Consideration.

  

##### 

  

##### (b) _Allocation of Cash and Stock_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, and after taking into consideration cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares, and after excluding shares for which no consideration
is payable as described in Section 2.2(a), 80% of the outstanding Sun
Common Stock shall be exchanged for Omega Common Stock and all remaining
outstanding Sun Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
cash. Such result shall be accomplished through the following adjustments to
the elections made by Sun Shareholders, and by giving due consideration to
cash payments for fractional shares:

  

##### 

  

###### (1) If the number of Cash Election Shares is in excess of 20% of the
Aggregate Shares, then (i) Non-Electing Shares shall be deemed to be Stock
Election Shares, and (ii)(A) Cash Election Shares of each Sun Shareholder who
made the Cash Election shall be reduced _pro rata_ by multiplying the number
of Cash Election Shares of such Sun Shareholder by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Sun Common Stock equal to 20% of the
Aggregate Shares, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Cash Election Shares of all Sun Shareholders, and (B) the shares of such Sun
Shareholder representing the difference between such Sun Shareholders
initial Cash Election Shares and such Sun Shareholders reduced Cash Election
Shares pursuant to clause (A) shall be converted into and be deemed to be
Stock Election Shares.

  

###### 

  

###### (2) If the number of Stock Election Shares is in excess of 80% of the
Aggregate Shares, then (i) Non-Electing Shares shall be deemed to be Cash
Election Shares and (ii) (A) Stock Election Shares of each Sun Shareholder
shall be reduced _pro rata_ by multiplying the number of Stock Election
Shares of such Sun Shareholder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Sun Common Stock equal to 80% of the Aggregate Shares and
the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares of
all Sun Shareholders, and (B) the shares of such Sun Shareholder representing
the difference between such Sun Shareholders initial Stock Election Shares
and such Sun Shareholders reduced Stock Election Shares pursuant to clause
(A) shall be converted into and be deemed to be Cash Election Shares.

  

###### 

  

###### (3) If the number of Cash Election Shares is less than 20% of the
Aggregate Shares and the number of Stock Election Shares is less than 80% of
the Aggregate Shares, then (i) there shall be no adjustment to the elections
made by electing Sun Shareholders,

  



  

14      
   



  

###### and (ii) Non-Electing Shares of each Sun Shareholder shall be treated
as Stock Elections Shares and/or as Cash Election Shares in proportion to the
respective amounts by which the Cash Election Shares and the Stock Election
Shares are less than the 20% and 80% limits, respectively.

  

###### 

  

##### (c) _Receipt of Payment_. After taking into account the
foregoing adjustment provisions, each Cash Election Share (including those
deemed to be Cash Election Shares) shall receive in the Merger the Cash
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 and each Stock Election Share
(including those deemed to be Stock Election Shares) shall receive in the
Merger the Stock Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares)
pursuant to Section 2.5.

  

##### 

  

#### 2.4 _Election Procedures_.

  

#### 

  

##### (a) The Election Form shall be distributed to each Sun Shareholder at
such time as Sun and Omega shall determine and shall specify the Election
Deadline.

  

##### 

  

##### (b) Elections shall be made by Sun Shareholders by mailing to the
Exchange Agent a completed Election Form. To be effective, an Election
Form must be properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by certificates representing the shares of Sun Common Stock as to
which the election is being made (or by an appropriate guaranty of delivery
by a commercial bank or trust company in the United States or a member of
a registered national security exchange or the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.), or by evidence that such certificates have been
lost, stolen or destroyed accompanied by such security or indemnity as shall
reasonably be requested by Omega. An Election Form and accompanying share
certificates must be received by the Exchange Agent by the close of business
on the Election Deadline.  An election may be changed or revoked but only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
including, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised Election
Form.

  

##### 

  

##### (c) Omega, or the Exchange Agent if so designated by Omega, shall
determine in the reasonable exercise of discretion, whether the Election
Forms have been properly completed, signed and submitted or changed or
revoked and may disregard immaterial defects in Election Forms.  Omega or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, will notify the applicable Sun
Shareholders of any defect in an Election Form by regular United States mail
or such other method of notice which can reasonably be expected to be
at least as prompt as notice by regular United States mail.

  

##### 

  

##### (d) For the purposes hereof, a Sun Shareholder who does not submit an
effective Election Form to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
shall be deemed to have made a Non-Election.

  

##### 

  

##### (e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the
provisions hereof and any certificates for shares have been transmitted to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to the provisions hereof, Omega and Sun shall
cause the Exchange Agent to return such certificates to the Person submitting
the same promptly after such termination.

  



  

15   

     

  

##### 2.5 Mechanics of Payment of Consideration.

  

##### 

  

##### (a) _Payment of the Merger Consideration_. Omega shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent sufficient certificates representing Omega Common Stock
and sufficient cash to enable the Exchange Agent to distribute the Aggregate
Consideration as determined pursuant to this Agreement. Within three business
days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall distribute, to all
Sun Shareholders who have properly submitted Election Forms together with
their share certificates or proper proofs with respect to lost certificates,
the Cash Merger Consideration and the Stock Merger Consideration to which
each such Sun Shareholder is entitled. Within five business days after
receiving properly completed Shareholder Materials, as set forth in Section
2.5(b), from any Sun Shareholder who made a Non-Election, the Exchange Agent
shall likewise distribute to such Sun Shareholder the Cash Merger
Consideration or Stock Merger Consideration, or a combination of both, which
such Sun Shareholder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement.

  

##### 

  

##### (b) _Submission Procedures for Non-Electing Shares_.  Within five
business days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall send the
Shareholder Materials to each Sun Shareholder who has made a Non-Election.
All Shareholder Materials shall be sent by first class United States mail to
such Sun Shareholders at the addresses set forth on the official shareholder
records of Sun. Omega shall also make appropriate provisions with the
Exchange Agent to enable Sun Shareholders to obtain the Shareholder Materials
from, and to deliver the certificates formerly representing shares of Sun
Common Stock to, the Exchange Agent in person, commencing on or not
later than the second business day following the Effective Time. Upon receipt
of the appropriate Shareholder Materials, together with the certificates
formerly evidencing and representing all of the shares of Sun Common Stock
which were validly held of record by such Sun Shareholder, the Exchange Agent
shall take prompt action to process such certificates formerly evidencing and
representing shares of Sun Common Stock received by it (including the prompt
return of any defective submissions with instructions as to those actions
which may be necessary to remedy any defects) and to mail to the Sun
Shareholders in exchange for the certificate(s) surrendered by them, the
consideration to be issued or paid for such Sun Shareholders shares pursuant
to the terms hereof.

  

##### 

  

##### (c) _Rights Appurtenant to Certificates Lost Certificates_.  After the
Effective Time and until properly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, each
outstanding certificate or certificates which formerly evidenced and
represented Sun Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent and evidence only the right to receive the aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration or aggregate Stock Merger Consideration into which such Sun
Common Stock was converted. The aggregate Cash Merger Consideration or
aggregate Stock Merger Consideration shall not be paid to the record holder
of any Sun Common Stock until the certificate therefor is surrendered in the
manner required.  Each Sun Shareholder will be responsible for all federal,
state and local taxes which may be incurred by him or her on account of his
or her receipt of the consideration to be paid in the Merger.  A Sun
Shareholder whose certificate(s) have been lost or destroyed
may nevertheless, subject to the provisions of this Article, receive the
aggregate Cash Merger Consideration or aggregate Stock Merger Consideration
to which such Sun Shareholder is entitled, provided that such Sun Shareholder
must first deliver to Omega or to the Exchange Agent: (i) a sworn statement
certifying such loss or destruction and specifying the circumstances thereof,
and (ii) a lost instrument bond in form satisfactory to Omega and the
Exchange Agent which has been duly executed by a corporate surety
satisfactory to Omega and the Exchange Agent, indemnifying the Surviving
Corporation,

  

16      
   



  

##### Omega, the Exchange Agent (and their respective successors) to
their satisfaction against any loss or expense which any of them may incur as
a result of such lost or destroyed certificates being presented. Any costs or
expenses which may arise from such replacement procedure, including the
premium on the lost instrument bond, shall be paid by the Sun Shareholder.

  

##### 

  

##### (d) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Sun shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Sun Common Stock
shall be made thereafter.

  

##### 

  

##### (e) _Right to Receive Dividends on Omega Common Stock_.  Each Sun
Shareholder who is entitled to receive the Stock Merger Consideration shall
be entitled, to the same extent as other holders of Omega Common Stock, to
payments of dividends, if any, on Omega Common Stock if the record date for
such dividend is on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
such dividends shall be paid, without interest, only after the Sun
Shareholder submits his or her certificate for Sun Common Stock pursuant to
Sections 2.4(b) or 2.5(b) or complies with the requirements of Section 2.5(c)
with respect to lost stock certificates. All dividends not paid on the
dividend payment date pursuant to this Section shall be paid by Omega to
the Exchange Agent, which shall remit them to the applicable shareholder
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 2.5(e).

  

##### 

  

#### 2.6 _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been
abandoned pursuant to Section 8.1, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article 7, the Closing will take place at
10:00 a.m. on the Closing Date, at Omegas corporate offices in State
College, Pennsylvania, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

  

#### 

  

#### 2.7 _Voting Agreements_. As a material inducement for Omega
entering into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this
Agreement by the Parties, each director and executive officer of Sun shall
enter into a Voting Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### 2.8 _Reservation of Shares_. Omega agrees that, prior to the
Effective Time, it will take appropriate action to reserve a sufficient
number of authorized but unissued shares of Omega Common Stock to be issued
as Stock Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

#### 2.9 _Certain Actions Relating to Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Omega and Sun shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of shares of Sun Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to such shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Sun to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

##### (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and the fulfillment of the terms hereof
will not result in a material violation or material breach of any of the
terms or provisions of, or constitute a material default under (or an event
which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would
constitute such a default under), or conflict with, or permit the
acceleration of, any material obligation under, any mortgage, lease,
covenant, agreement, indenture or other instrument to which Sun or any Sun
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or their respective properties
or assets is bound, the Charter Documents of Sun or any Sun Subsidiary; or
any judgment, decree, order, regulatory letter of understanding or award of
any Governmental Authority by which Sun or any Sun Subsidiary, or their
respective properties or assets, is bound, or any material Consent, permit,
concession, grant, franchise, license, law, statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to Sun or any Sun Subsidiary or the properties or

or subject to or bound by, any agreement, judgment, order, letter of
understanding, writ, prohibition, injunction or decree of any Governmental
Authority, or any Applicable Law which would prevent the execution of this
Agreement by Sun, the delivery hereof to Omega or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for such laws as require that the
approval of Sun Shareholders and the Banking Approvals be obtained), and no
Proceeding is pending against Sun or any Sun Subsidiary in which the validity
of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any action
which has been taken by either of the Parties in connection herewith, or, in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby, is at issue.

#### 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) the Banking Approvals,

third Person are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by
Sun of this Agreement or the consummation by Sun of the Merger and the other

Consents would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

#### 3.5 _Licenses,Franchises and Permits_. Sun and each Sun Subsidiary holds
all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses, except where the failure to hold such

19      
   



  

#### subject to the legal right and authority of such successor to engage
in the activities licensed, franchised, permitted or authorized thereby and
except where the failure of such licenses, franchises, permits and
authorizations to be in full force and effect and transferable to a successor
to Sun or a Sun Subsidiary would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary has received
notice of any Proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any such
license, franchise, permit, or authorization and no such Proceeding is
pending or, to Suns knowledge, has been threatened by any Governmental
Authority.

  

####

complete copies of the Charter Documents of Sun and each Sun Subsidiary.

  

####

forth therein, in each case in conformity with GAAP consistently applied, it
being understood that Suns interim financial statements are not audited, not

20      
   



  

advances being deemed both in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice);

  



  

##### (f) any amendment, modification or termination of any contract or
agreement (other than contracts or agreements related to loans made by
SunBank) in excess of $75,000, relating to Sun or any Sun Subsidiary, or to
which any Sun or any Sun Subsidiary is a party, which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

  

##### 

  

##### (g) any increase in, or commitment to increase, the compensation
payable or to become payable to any officer, director, employee or agent of
Sun or any Sun Subsidiary, or any bonus payment, stock option award,

with past practice; or

  

##### 

  

##### (i) any material alteration in the manner of keeping the books,

checking accounts), is a brokered deposit.

  

#### 

  

#### 3.10 _Properties_. Section 3.10 of the Sun Schedule contains a true and
complete list of all material Sun Real Property. Except as adequately
reserved against in the Sun Financial Statements or disposed of since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business, Sun and each Sun
Subsidiary has good and marketable title, free and clear of all material
liens, encumbrances, charges, defaults, or equities of whatever character to
all of the material properties and assets, real or personal, reflected in the
Sun Financial Statements as being owned by Sun or any Sun Subsidiary as of
the dates thereof. All buildings, and all fixtures, equipment, and other
property and assets that are material to the business of Sun and the Sun
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases by Sun
or any Sun Subsidiary, are held under valid instruments enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, or by
equitable principles), and neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary nor, to Suns
knowledge, any other party thereto is in material breach or material default
thereunder.

#### 3.11 _Intellectual Property_. Section 3.11 of the Sun Schedule contains
a true and complete list of all material Sun Intellectual Property. Either
Sun or one of the Sun Subsidiaries own or have a valid license to use all
Sun Intellectual Property, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, royalty
or other payment obligations (except for royalties or payments with respect
to off-the-shelf Software at standard commercial rates). Sun Intellectual
Property

  



  

21      
   



  

#### constitutes all of the Intellectual Property necessary to carry on
the business of Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except
where the failure to have such property would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Sun Intellectual Property is valid and
has not been cancelled, forfeited, expired or abandoned, and neither Sun nor
any Sun Subsidiary has received any notice challenging the validity or
enforceability of Sun Intellectual Property, other than as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To Suns knowledge,
the conduct of the business of Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries does not
violate, misappropriate or infringe upon the Intellectual Property rights of
any third Person. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the material loss or material impairment of the
right of Sun or any Sun Subsidiary to own or use any of the Sun Intellectual
Property, and the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will have
substantially the same rights to own or use the Sun Intellectual Property
following the consummation of such transactions as Sun and the Sun
Subsidiaries had prior to the consummation of such transactions, except such
rights as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

#### 3.12 _Condition of Fixed Assets and Equipment_. Section 3.12 of the Sun
Schedule contains a list of all material fixed assets and equipment used in
the conduct of the business of Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries as of the Balance
Sheet Date. Each such item of fixed assets and equipment having a net book
value in excess of $75,000 is, to Suns knowledge, in good operating
condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.

  

#### 

  

#### 3.13 _Tax Matters_.

  

#### 

  

##### (a) All federal, state and local Tax Returns required to be filed by or
on behalf of Sun or any Sun Subsidiary have been timely filed, or Sun or any
applicable Sun Subsidiary has received an appropriate extension therefor.
 All Tax Returns filed are, and the information contained therein
is, complete and accurate in all material respects. All Tax obligations
reflected in such returns have been timely paid. Except as described
in Section 3.13(a) of the Sun Schedule, neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary
is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any Tax Return. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no audit
examination, deficiency, or refund litigation or matter in controversy with
respect to any Taxes that might reasonably be expected to result in a
determination materially adverse to Sun or any Sun Subsidiary except as fully
reserved for in the Sun Financial Statements. All Taxes, interest, additions,
and penalties due with respect to completed and settled examinations or
concluded litigation have been paid;

  

##### 

  

##### (b) Neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary has executed an extension or
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any
Tax due that is currently in effect;

  

##### 

  

##### (c) Adequate provision for any federal, state or local Taxes due or to
become due by Sun or any Sun Subsidiary for all periods through and including
December 31, 2003, has been made and is reflected on the December 31, 2003
financial statements included in Suns Report on Form 10-K for the period
then ending, and has been and will continue to be made with respect to
periods ending after December 31, 2003 on a basis consistent with its
historic Tax accounting practices and GAAP;

  



  

22      
   



  

##### (d) Deferred taxes of Sun and each Sun Subsidiary have been and will be
provided for in accordance with GAAP;

  

##### 

  

##### (e) Neither the U.S. Internal Revenue Service nor any state, local or
other taxing authority is now asserting or threatening to assert against Sun
or any Sun Subsidiary any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes, or
interest thereon or penalties in connection therewith. All income, payroll,
withholding, property, excise, sales, use, franchise and transfer taxes, and
all other Taxes, charges, fees, levies or other assessments, imposed upon Sun
or any Sun Subsidiary by the United States or by any state, municipality,
subdivision or instrumentality of the United States or by any other taxing
authority, including all interest, penalties or additions attributable
thereto, which are due and payable by Sun or any Sun Subsidiary, either have
been paid in full or have been properly accrued and reflected in the Sun
Financial Statements;

  

##### 

  

##### (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the Sun Schedule, neither
Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary has made any material payments, is obligated to
make any material payments, or is a party to any agreement that under certain
circumstances could obligate it to make any material payments that will not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code; and

  

##### 

  

##### (g) Neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary (i) is a party to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement, (ii) has been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the
common parent of which was Sun), or (iii) has any Tax liability for any
Person (other than Sun or any Sun Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  

##### 

  

#### 3.14 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending against Sun or any Sun
Subsidiary, or to Suns knowledge, threatened against or affecting Sun or any
Sun Subsidiary or any of their assets, that may, if decided against Sun or
any Sun Subsidiary, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

#### 3.15 _Environmental Matters_. To Suns knowledge, the Sun Real Property
is and has been in compliance with all Environmental Laws, and there are
no conditions existing currently which would subject Sun or any Sun
Subsidiary to damages, penalties, injunctive relief or cleanup costs under
any Environmental Laws or assertions thereof, or which require cleanup,
removal, remedial action or other response pursuant to Environmental Laws by
Sun or any Sun Subsidiary. Neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary is a party to
any Proceeding relating to Environmental Laws, nor are any of them (either in
their own capacity or as trustee or fiduciary) required to clean up, remove
or take remedial or other responsive action due to the disposal, depositing,
discharge, leaking or other release of any hazardous substances or materials.
None of the Sun Real Property is, nor is Sun or any Sun Subsidiary, subject
to any judgment, decree, order or citation related to or arising out of any
Environmental Laws. No Consents, permits or licenses are required under
Environmental Laws relative to the Sun Real Property. Neither Sun nor any Sun
Subsidiary has stored, deposited, treated, recycled, used or disposed of any
materials (including, without limitation, asbestos) on, under or at the Sun
Real Property (or tanks or other facilities thereon containing such
materials), which materials, if known to be present on the Sun Real Property
or present in soils or ground water, would require cleanup, removal or some
other remedial action under the Environmental Laws.

  



  

23      
   



  

#### 3.16 _Insurance_. Section 3.16 of the Sun Schedule includes a complete
list of all insurance policies (other than title insurance policies or
insurance policies of which any Sun Subsidiary is a beneficiary incident to
the making of individual loans) held by Sun or any Sun Subsidiary. There are
no outstanding unresolved claims for losses under any such insurance
policies. Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries have paid all amounts due and payable
under any insurance policies and guaranties applicable to them and their

contemplated hereby are terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) or (d) (in
