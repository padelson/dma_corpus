Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, (i) the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into OP,
(ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the

of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, (iv) the
directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,
(v) the officers of Merger Sub shall be the initial officers of the Surviving

one validly  issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value  $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) All shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock that are owned or  held in the treasury of
OP shall be cancelled and no consideration shall be  delivered in exchange
therefor.   (c) Each share of Preferred Stock that is issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right  to receive cash in an amount of $1,000.00 per share of Preferred
Stock (the  "Preferred Stock Consideration"). All such shares of Preferred
Stock, when  so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  cancelled and returned and each holder of a certificate
representing any  such shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except  the right to receive cash in accordance with Section
2.3.   (d) Each share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including all shares of Common 
Stock owned by VC or any of its affiliates, (other than shares of Common

Dissenting Stockholder (as defined in Section 1.4(f)) shall be converted 
into the right to receive cash equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in 
Section 2.2(d)) per share. All such shares of Common Stock, when so 
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be 
cancelled and returned and each holder of a certificate representing any 
such shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except  the
right to receive cash in accordance with Section 1.5 or 2.2.   (e) Each
Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall
become and represent the right to receive cash on the same terms  and
conditions as are applicable under that certain Warrant Agreement dated  May
21, 1998 by and between OP and Harris Trust and Savings Bank (the  "Warrant
Agreement") as if the holder of such Warrant had exercised the  Warrant into
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, minus  the exercise
price of such Warrant, (the "Warrant Consideration"). All such  Warrants,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be
cancelled and returned and each holder of certificate  representing any such
Warrants, shall cease to have any rights with respect  thereto, except the
right to receive cash in accordance with Section 1.5.   (f) Any issued and
outstanding share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock  held by persons who
object to the Merger and comply with all the provisions  of the law of the
State of Delaware concerning the rights of holders of  Common Stock to
dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their  shares of  
A-2    Common Stock ("Dissenting Stockholders") shall not be converted
pursuant to  Section 1.4(d), but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as  may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the  law of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that shares
of Common  Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time and  held by any Dissenting Stockholder who shall, after the Effective
Time,  withdraw his demand for appraisal or lose his right of appraisal as 
provided in such law, shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective 
Time, into the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 1.4(d). OP 
will give VC prompt notice of its receipt of any written demands for 
purchase of any shares of Common Stock, together with copies of such 
demands. OP shall permit VC to participate in all negotiations and 
proceedings with respect to demands for purchase of any shares of Common 
Stock, as may be demanded under the DGCL. OP shall not, except with prior 
written consent of VC or as required under applicable laws (in which case  OP
will notify VC), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any  demands
for the purchase of Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any  such
demands.   (g) Each fractional share of Common Stock, each fractional
Warrant share  and each fractional Warrant shall be converted into the right
to receive  cash equal to the Exchange Ratio per share times the fraction
representing  such fractional share of Common Stock, Warrant Share or
Warrant.   (h) The Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1)
delivered upon  the surrender for exchange of shares of capital stock of OP
and the  Warrants in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been  delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of  capital stock of OP and such Warrants. There shall be no further 
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the shares of 
capital stock of OP or the Warrants which were outstanding immediately  prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates  for
shares of capital stock of OP or any Warrants are presented to OP for  any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this  Article
I.   1.5 Exchange Agent for Warrant Shares and the Warrants.   (a) Prior
to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint an exchange  agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in connection with the exchange of (i) any  issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock that have been issued by OP  prior to the
Effective Time as a result of the exercise of any Warrant (the  "Warrant
Shares") and (ii) any Warrants.   (b) Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, VC shall cause Merger Sub  to be sufficiently capitalized to pay the
Merger Consideration (as defined  in Section 2.1).   (c) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent  shall mail to each
holder of record of Warrant Shares or Warrants (i) a  letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,  and risk of loss and
title to Warrant Shares or Warrants shall pass, only  upon delivery of
Warrant Shares or the Warrants to the Exchange Agent and  shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as VC or Merger Sub  may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of
certificates representing the Warrant Shares or the Warrants  in exchange for
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate  representing Warrant
Shares or Warrants for cancellation to the Exchange  Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by VC or Merger  Sub, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of  such certificate for
Warrant Shares or Warrants shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash to be paid for such shares  under Section 1.4(d) or for
such Warrants under Section 1.4(e) computed to  be due under this Agreement.
The certificates or Warrants so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of  Warrants Shares or Warrants which is
not registered on the transfer records  of OP, the cash to be paid in
exchange for such shares pursuant to Section  1.4(e) may be delivered to a
transferee if the certificate representing  Warrant Shares or Warrants are
presented to the Exchange Agent and  accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer  and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.5, each certificate or  Warrant shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent  the right to receive upon such surrender the
cash in exchange for such  share pursuant to Section 1.4(e) as provided by
this Article I and the  provisions of DGCL.   A-3    Article II

schedule.   3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. OP is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State

Subsidiary), (i) owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the stock or
other equity interests the holders of which are generally entitled to
vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing body of
such legal entity; provided, however, that with respect to entities in which

directors or has the right to consent, or withhold consent, to any actions to
be taken by such entity, (ii) is a general partner, trustee or other entity
or person performing similar functions or (iii) has control (as defined in

of each of the OP Disclosure Schedule SAR granted, the number of shares
subject to each SAR, the expiration date of each such SAR and the price at
which each such SAR may be exercised under the OP SAR Plan and whether each
SAR is fully vested or exercisable. None of the SARs listed on Section 3.2 of
the OP Disclosure Schedule are vested or exercisable. None of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will accelerate the vesting of any SAR or
otherwise cause any SAR to become exercisable. No Triggering Event (as
defined in the OP SAR Plan has occurred, and none of the execution and

Event to occur. Except as set forth on Section 3.2 of the OP Disclosure
Schedule, all outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock are

conversion rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which OP or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which OP or any of its Subsidiaries
may be bound that do   A-6   or may obligate OP or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of the capital stock of OP or any equity interest in
any Subsidiary, as the case may be, or that do or may obligate OP or any of

Subsidiaries are under any obligation to register under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") any of its presently outstanding
securities or any securities that may subsequently be issued.   3.3

the stockholders of OP, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by OP and
the Stockholder Group of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of

all necessary corporate action on the part of OP and the Stockholder Group,
as the case may be, except for approval of this Agreement by the stockholders
of OP, and have been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of OP. No

OP and the Stockholder Group and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation each of OP and the Stockholder Group enforceable against each of
OP and the Stockholder Group in accordance with its respective terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except
that the availability of equitable remedies is subject to discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. Subject to
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not conflict with or result in any violation of any
material statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order, decree, or
ordinance applicable to OP, its Subsidiaries or the Stockholder Group or
their respective properties or assets, or conflict with or result in any
breach or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of a material lien or encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of OP or

party or by which OP or any of its Subsidiaries or the Stockholder Group or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except
where such conflict, violation, breach or default would not have a material
effect on OP or any of its Subsidiaries or the consummation of the
transaction contemplated herein. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative
agency, commission, regulatory authority or other governmental authority or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required
by or with respect to OP or any of its Subsidiaries or the Stockholder Group
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by OP or the
Stockholder Group or the consummation by OP or the Stockholder Group of the
transactions contemplated hereby except for, (s) to the extent applicable,
the filing of a premerger notification report by OP under the Hart-Scott-

compliance with any applicable requirements with the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (u) any regulatory approval under
the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996
("Communications Acts"), together with the rules, regulations and published

material adverse effect on OP.   3.4 Financial Statements. OP has furnished
VC with audited balance sheets of OP as of its fiscal year end for 1997, 1998
and 1999, and audited statements of income for the fiscal years then ended as
disclosed on Section 3.4 of the OP Disclosure Schedule and the unaudited
balance sheets as of March 31, 2000, and unaudited statements of income for
the quarter March 31, 2000 then ended and from the preceding comparative
year\'s quarters (collectively, the "OP Financial Statements"). The OP
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP") (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present in all material respects
the financial position of OP as at the dates thereof and the results of their
operations and changes in financial position for the periods then ended,
except in the case of the unaudited financial statements, for the omission of
footnote information and for customary year-end adjustments. The reserves set
forth in the OP Financial Statements were established in accordance with
GAAP, and to the Knowledge of OP, are adequate. There has been no change in
OP\'s accounting policies, except as described in the notes to the OP
Financial Statements.   3.5 Compliance with Law. Each of OP and its
Subsidiaries is in material compliance and have conducted its business so as
to materially comply with all laws, rules and regulations, judgments, decrees
or orders of any Governmental Entity applicable to its operations or with
respect to which compliance is a condition of engaging in the business
thereof. Except for violations which do not, or could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on OP\'s or any Subsidiary\'s
business, operations or financial condition and which can be remedied through
routine filings without penalty or costs exceeding $2,000 for any individual
filing or $50,000 in the aggregate, none of OP or its Subsidiaries are in
violation of any permits, franchises, licenses, authorizations, certificates,
variances, exemptions, orders, registrations or consents that are granted by
any Governmental Entity. There are no judgments or orders, injunctions,
decrees, stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a court or
administrative agency or by arbitration) against OP or any of
its Subsidiaries or against any of its respective properties or businesses.
To the Knowledge of OP and each of its Subsidiaries, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to OP or any of its
Subsidiaries in relation to any alleged violation of law or regulation is
pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention
to conduct the same. As used in this Agreement, "Knowledge" shall mean the
knowledge of each of James A. Otterbeck, William Wallace, Stephen Kelley,
John Stavig, Mark Fuller, Laurel Dent, Jon Bergman, Clarissa Quimson and
Michael Thompson, as the case may be, assuming in each case reasonable
investigation.   3.6 No Defaults. Neither OP nor any of its Subsidiaries

constituency documents or (ii) in default or violation of any term, condition
or provision of (A) any judgment, decree, order, injunction or stipulation
applicable to OP or its Subsidiaries or (B) any material agreement, note,
mortgage, indenture, contract, lease or instrument, permit, concession,
franchise or license to which OP or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
OP\'s or any Subsidiary\'s properties or assets may be bound.   3.7

the Knowledge of OP or any Subsidiary, threatened, against OP or any of its
Subsidiaries or that challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or
delay the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 3.7

suit, proceeding, claim or investigation to which OP or any Subsidiary is a
party to the extent that the aggregate damages claimed for all such
complaints exceed $50,000, the forum, the parties thereto, a brief
description of the subject matter thereof and the amount of damages claimed.

Limitations on Amount. (a) The Stockholders Group shall not have
any obligation to indemnify VC or the Surviving Corporation from and against
any Claims resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the breach of any representation or warranty until VC and Merger
Sub have suffered such Claims by reason of breaches in the aggregate equal to
or exceeding One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (after which point the
Stockholders Group will be obligated to indemnify VC and the Surviving
Corporation from and against all such further Claims). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the Stockholders Group   A-32   shall be obligated
to indemnify VC and the Surviving Corporation for any individual breach of
any representation or warranty equal to or exceeding One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) without regard to the $1,000,000 deductible. Any amounts
payable under Section 8.1(g) will be excluded from the foregoing deductible
or the $100,000 threshold and VC or the Surviving Corporation may seek
reimbursement for any claims arising out of Section 8.1(g) immediately.  
(b) With respect to Claims based on breaches of representations and 
warranties set forth in Section 3.14, 3.7, 3.12 and 3.2, the Stockholders 
Groups\' liability to VC or to the Surviving Corporation shall not exceed, 
in the aggregate, One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000), which will be 
reduced by an amount equal to $100,000,000 minus all Claims paid. With 
respect to all other Claims relating to any other representations or 
warrantees, the liability of the Stockholders Group will be limited to the 
then outstanding principal amount of the Promissory Note.   (c) The
limitations set forth in Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(b) will  not apply to
any willful breach by OP, any Subsidiary or any of the  Stockholders Group of
any covenant, representation or warranty contained in  this Agreement, for
any damages based on claims of fraud or claims based on  the untruthfulness,
an inaccuracy or the incompleteness of the  representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.2 or for Claims under  Section 8.1(d).   8.4 Notice
of Claim.   (a) In the event VC or the Surviving Corporation shall have a
claim  against the Stockholders Group that does not involve a claim or
demand  being asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third
party,  VC or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly give notice of such
claim or  demand promptly to VIC II, which notices shall specify the nature
of such  claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to
the  extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the
final  amount of such claim and demand) (the "Notice of Claim").   (b) VIC
II shall have fifteen (15) days from the personal delivery or  mailing of the
Notice of Claim (the "Notice Period") to notify VC or the  Surviving
Corporation whether or not any of the Stockholders Group dispute  the Claim.
A "Disputed Claim" shall mean (i) any Claim for which notice of  a dispute
has been received and (ii) any Claim for which a Notice of Claim  has been
delivered or mailed but for which Claim the 15 day Notice Period  has not yet
lapsed. If VIC II does not notify VC or the Surviving  Corporation within the
Notice Period that it disputes such Claim, (after  the expiration of the
Notice Period, an "Undisputed Claim"), the amount of  such Undisputed Claim
shall be conclusively deemed a liability that is  subject to indemnification
by the Stockholders Group hereunder.   (c) The omission or delay of any
indemnified party to give an  indemnifying party a Notice of Claim shall not
relieve the indemnifying  party from any liability in respect of such claim,
demand or action which  it may have to such indemnified party on account of
the indemnity agreement  of such indemnifying party contained in this Article
VIII, except to the  extent such indemnifying party can establish actual
prejudice and direct  damages as a result thereof.   (d) Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to prevent VC or the  Surviving Corporation from
making a claim hereunder for potential or  contingent claims or demands.  
(e) Whenever any Claim covered by OP\'s indemnification obligation  pursuant
to Section 8.1 is made by any person not a party to this  Agreement, VC or
Merger Sub shall mail a Notice to Claim to VIC II within  thirty (30) days
after either VC or Merger Sub has received written notice  of the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim.   (f) The Stockholders
Group shall have the right to assume and thereafter  conduct the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice,  which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to VC or Merger Sub;  provided, however, that the
Stockholders Group shall not consent to the of  any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to such Third Party  Claim without the prior
written consent of VC or Merger Sub, which consent  shall not be unreasonably
withheld, but such consent shall not be required  if   A-33    the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money  damages
and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon VC  or
Merger Sub. The Stockholders Group assumption and conduct of such  defense
shall be deemed to be an acknowledgment of their indemnification  obligation
under Section 8.1(a) and shall be liable for any final  adjudication. Unless
and until or one or more of the Stockholders Group  assumes the defense of
the Third Party Claim as provided herein, VC or  Merger Sub may defend
against the Third Party Claim in any manner they  reasonably may deem
appropriate. In no event shall VC or Merger Sub consent  to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to  the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders  Group, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,  if the Stockholders
Group withhold their consent, they shall explain in  writing their reasons
for withholding consent, and upon receipt of such  written explanation, VC or
Merger Sub shall nevertheless be authorized to  consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement, the  terms of which are reasonable.
The Stockholders Group shall, within ten  (10) business days of their being
notified of the proposed consent judgment  or settlement, provide their
consent or their written explanation of the  reasons for refusing to
consent.   (g) The parties shall undertake, in good faith, to resolve any
dispute  with respect to any Disputed Claim. If the parties are unable to
agree on  such resolution with thirty (30) days after OP receives the Notice
of  Claim, the respective rights of the parties shall be determined in 
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, unless 
the issue of the Stockholders Group\'s indemnification obligation pursuant 
to Section 8.1 has been or will be decided in litigation involving a Third 
Party Claim in which one or more of the following, OP, its Subsidiaries or 
the Stockholders Group and VC or Merger Sub are parties. The arbitration 
shall be conducted in the Washington, D.C. area by three arbitrators, each 
of whom shall have experience reasonably related to the business of OP, and 
each of VC or Merger Sub and the Stockholders Group shall have the right to 
designate one of the arbitrators. The third arbitrator shall be designated 
by mutual agreement of the parties or, if they cannot agree, by mutual 
agreement of the two arbitrators. The decision of the arbitrators in any 
arbitration pursuant to this Section 8.4(g) will be final and binding upon 
the parties, and the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be 
entered thereon. Fees of the arbitrators and costs of arbitration shall be 
borne by the parties in such manner as shall be determined by the 
arbitrators.   (h) Gross Up. If any indemnification payment is determined to
be taxable  to either of VC or Merger Sub by any taxing authority,
Indemnitor\'s shall  also indemnify VC or Merger Sub for any Taxes incurred
by reason of the  receipt or accrual of such payment (taking into account any
actual  reduction in tax liability to the recipient) and any costs and
expenses  (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred by VC or Merger
Sub in  connection with such Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim,
demand,  dispute, action, suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment, including
the  defense or settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes). The amount 
recoverable by VC or Merger Sub shall take into account the value of any 
insurance recoveries or actual reduction in Tax liability realized by VC  and
arising from the same incident or set of facts or circumstances giving  rise
to the claim for indemnity.   8.5 Escrowed Funds; Promissory Note.   (a)
At Closing, Merger Sub will deliver $8,100,000 to the Escrow Agent  in
accordance withSection 2.3(c) hereof, to be administered in accordance  with
the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement mutually agreeable to  OP and
VC (the "Escrow Agreement") which shall provide that the Escrowed  Funds will
not be released from Escrow until such time that the Senior  Notes are no
longer issued and outstanding and upon the expiration or  redemption of the
Senior Notes, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the  VIC II.   (b) At
Closing, BAI shall execute a Promissory Note in favor of VIC II  for a
principal amount of $100,000,000 with interest at an annual rate of  10%
compounded monthly (the "Promissory Note") in the form as attached  hereto as
Exhibit 8.5(b). "Final Payment Date" shall be the date on which  the last
amount of principal and interest are paid pursuant to the terms of  the
Promissory Note.   A-34    Article IX   General Provisions   9.1

Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   9.4 Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts; (including a facsimile) have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party.   9.5 Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties delivered pursuant
hereto constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder except as otherwise expressly provided herein.   9.6
(S)1060 Allocation. VC shall have the sole right to allocate the
Merger Consideration pursuant to (S)1060 of the Code and if required OP

forms whether federal or state required or necessary to comply with the
intent of this provision.   A-36    9.7 No Transfer. This Agreement and
the rights and obligations set forth herein may not be transferred or
assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the consent of each party
hereto. This Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   9.8
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
will for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.   9.9 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein and to
the extent that liabilities are limited by the terms of this Agreement (it
being understood that the provisions of this Agreement set forth monetary
damages, as the exclusive remedies for a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III and a breach of the covenants and
agreements in Article V), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity on such party, and the exercise
of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other.   9.10
Further Assurances. Each party agrees to cooperate fully with the
other parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and
agreements and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably
requested by any other party to evidence and reflect the transactions
described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents
and purposes of this Agreement.   9.11 Absence of Third Party Beneficiary
Rights. No provision of this Agreement is intended, nor will be interpreted,
to provide to create any third party beneficiary rights or any other rights
of any kind in any client, customer, affiliate, stockholder, employee,
partner or any party hereto or any other person or entity unless specifically
provided otherwise herein, and, except as so provided, all provisions hereof
will be personal solely between the parties to this Agreement.   9.12

provision hereof has been subject to the mutual consultation, negotiation and
agreement of VC and OP, and shall not be construed for or against any
party hereto.   9.13 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the

principles).   9.14 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempted assignment thereof
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
