prior to the day which is five Business Days before the Effective Date.

---|---|--- 



 

39 ---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Buyer or Vignette was aware that such intentional act or

intentional act or omission (including that a Buyer Claim might result) would
(or would be likely to) cause or result in the Loss the subject of the Buyer
Claim,

Buyers Contribution to Loss.



   9.4 | Reimbursement for amounts recovered

corporate avails itself of proper credits, deductions, allowances and other
savings in respect of Tax, the Buyer or the relevant related body corporate of
the Buyer will take all steps reasonably necessary and in a timely fashion to
avail itself of all such avenues of recovery, at the Buyers cost. 
---|---|---

OPTION HOLDER COMPENSATION CALCULATION

 



At Completion, the Sellers will deliver a schedule setting out the calculation
of the final allocation of consideration for each Seller and the Optionholder
compensation for the cancellation of the Company Plan and all of the Company
Options. The schedule will detail for each Optionholder their respective
interest in the Purchase Price and the Escrow and Contingency Escrow. The
schedule will be calculated using the following methodology.



Core Assumptions:



   1. | 13.4062% of all consideration is placed in an escrow account for
the benefit of the Buyer. Calculated as described in paragraph A(5)below. 
---|--- 


   2. | Contingency Escrow amount of 2.2593% of the consideration is
placed in a separate escrow account for the benefit of the Buyer. Calculated
as described below in paragraph A(7) below.  
---|--- 



   3. | Redeemable Preference Shares are redeemed for cash at face value
as described in paragraph A(1). 
---|--- 



   4. | Cash defined in Part A will be reduced if there is any Excess
Expenses Consideration by an amount equal to such Excess Expenses
Consideration. 
---|--- 


Part A



Overview: Description of calculations necessary to allocate value between
holders of ordinary shares and options.



1\. Definition of value per Tower diluted share ("Tp"): 



Tp = _Cash + (Vn * Vp) + (On * Oep)_  

(Tn + On)



Where:



Cash = $57,586,854 [ _Being, US$45 million converted to A$ using the Effective
Date Exchange Rate), less any RPS Amount_ ]



Effective Date Exchange Rate = 0.7552 [ _Being the A$ purchase exchange rate
for US$ listed in the Wall Street Journal on January 20, 2004_ ]



RPS = Redeemable Preference Share Amount ($2,000,010 paid prior to completion)



Vn = 29,814,035 Vignette Shares [ _Being US$ 80.0 million in stock based on
VIGN average price of $2.6833 for the ten day trading period ending 16
January 2004_ ]



Vp = (Closing price of Vignette Shares on the date prior to the Completion
Date) * the Completion Exchange Rate



Completion Exchange Rate = the A$ purchase exchange rate for US$ listed in the
Wall Street Journal on the date two days prior to the Completion Date



On = the total number of Tower Shares which would be issued if all of the
Company Options were exercised (331,950)



IOn = in reference to an individual Option grant, the number of Tower Shares
issuable upon the exercise of that Option and payment of the IOep for each of
those Tower Shares



Oep = the weighted average subscription price for all Tower Shares the subject
of the Company Options ($5.793)



IOep = in reference to an individual Option grant, the subscription price for
each Tower Share the subject of that individual Option grant



Tn = the number of outstanding Tower ordinary shares (3,385,165)



2\. Total Aggregate Value of Optionholder Compensation ("Oag") 



Oag = (Tp  Oep) * On



3\. Total Aggregate Value of Seller Consideration ("Sag") 



Sag = Tp * Tn



4\. Optionholder Percentage ("Op%")



Op% = _ Oag _ 

(Oag + Sag)



5\. Base Escrow Amount ("Base Escrow Amount")



Base Escrow Amount = $22,189,883 [ _Being US$15.625 million*Effective Date
Exchange Rate) + $1.5 million_ ]



Base Escrow Percentage = 13.4062% [ _Being_ _Base Escrow Amount_

Total Purchase Price]



 

6\. Base Escrow Amount Composition



Base Escrow Cash = $7,988,358 [ _Being_ (Base Escrow Percentage * (Cash +
RPS)) [ _Note, this is a fixed $ Amount_ ]]



Base Escrow Stock = 3,966,941 Vignette Shares [ _Being_ (Base Escrow
Percentage * Vn) [ _Note, this is a fixed # of Shares_ ]]



Total Purchase Price = as defined in Section 5.5 (ie, Cash + RPS + (Vn*Vp))



7\. Contingency Escrow Amount Composition



Contingency Escrow Amount = $3,739,654 [ _Being the amount identified plus
interest at specified rate through 30 September 2005_ ]



Contingency Escrow % = 2.2593% [ _Being_ _Contingency Escrow Amount_

Total Purchase Price]

 



Contingency Escrow Cash = $1,346,275 [ _Being_ (Contingency Escrow % * (Cash +
RPS)) [ _Note, this is a fixed $ Amount_ ]]



Contingency Escrow Stock = 673,603 Vignette Shares [ _Being_ (Contingency
Escrow % * Vn) [ _Note, this is a fixed # of Shares_ ]]



Part B



1\. Aggregate Optionholder Completion Cash Compensation ("Occ")



Tpc = _Cash + (On * Oep)_

(Tn + On)



Occ = (Tpc - Oep) * On



Aggregate Amount Contributed to Base Escrow ("AACBE") = Occ * Base Escrow %



Aggregate Amount Contributed to Contingency Escrow ("AACCE") = Occ *
Contingency Escrow %



Net Completion Cash = Occ  AACBE - AACCE



2\. Individual Optionholder Completion Cash Compensation ("IOcc")



IOcc = (Tpc - IOep) * IOn



3\. Individual Optionholder Cash Contribution to Escrows



 

Individual Base Escrow Optionholder Cash ("IBEOC") = IOcc * Base Escrow %



Individual Contingency Escrow Cash = IOcc * Contingency Escrow %



Individual Net Completion Cash = IOcc  IBEOC - Individual Contingency Escrow
Cash



Part C



Description: Disposal Value of Completion Date available Optionholder Shares
allocated to (i) Base Escrow, (ii) Contingency Escrow, and (iii)
Optionholders



Post Completion Optionholder % = _ (On) _

 (On + Tn)



i.e. 331,950 / 3,715,115 = 8.930%



[ _This percentage reflects that optionholders have paid in full the exercise
price in connection with receiving the cash proceeds and so are now treated
pari passu with ordinary shares_ ]



Net Disposal Price = Net proceeds from sale or cancellation of OH
Compensation Shares for Optionholders available at S-3 effective date * S-3
Exchange Rate per OH Compensation Share



OH Compensation Shares ("Ods") = (Vn * Post Completion Optionholder %)



 

Optionholder Disposal Compensation = Ods * Net Disposal Price [ _This is the
total amount received from the sale of the Ods shares on S-3 Effective Date_
] 



Base Escrow Shares = Post Completion Optionholder % * Base Escrow Stock 



Base Escrow Value = Base Escrow Shares * Net Disposal Price [ _This amount
is delivered to Escrow Holder_ ]



Contingency Escrow Shares = Post Completion Optionholder % * Contingency
Escrow Stock



Contingency Escrow Value = Contingency Escrow Shares * Net Disposal Price [
_This amount is delivered to Escrow Holder_ ]



Free Disposal Number = Ods  Base Escrow Shares  Contingency Escrow Shares



Free Disposal Value = Free Disposal Number * Net Disposal Price [ _This amount
is delivered to Optionholders_ ]



Individual Optionholder Disposal Compensation = _IOn * Free Disposal Value_

 

On



S-3 Exchange Rate = the A$ purchase exchange rate for US$ listed in the Wall
Street Journal on the S-3 Registration date



Part D



Description: Amounts liquidated and held in escrows for benefit of
Optionholders



Individual Base Escrow Optionholder Disbursement = _IOn * Base Escrow
Disbursement_  

On



Base Escrow Disbursement = Disbursement from Optionholder Base Escrow that
includes accrued interest



Individual Contingency Escrow Optionholder Disbursement = _IOn * Contingency
Disbursement_

On



Contingency Disbursement = Disbursement from Optionholder Base Escrow that
includes accrued interest
