which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the

ARTICLE I 
  
  
  EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DLLCA,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, the separate  existence of
Merger Sub shall cease (except as may be continued by operation of Law) and
the Company shall continue as the Surviving Company and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent.

 

1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at  the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub or the Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all  debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, in each
case, in accordance with the DLLCA.

 

1.3 _Certificate of Formation; Limited Liability Company Agreement_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub or the Company, (a) the certificate of formation  of the Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated in the form of _Exhibit A_ and attached
to the Certificate of Merger and, as so amended, shall be  the certificate of
formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with
the terms thereof or as provided by applicable Law, and (b) the limited
liability company agreement of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to  the Effective Time shall be the limited liability company agreement of
the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms
thereof, the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company or as provided
by applicable Law;  provided that, in each case, the name of the company set
forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

 

1.4 _Officers and Managers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company,
each such officer to hold office in accordance with the  limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company and until such officer's successor
is duly appointed and qualified, or such officer's earlier death, resignation
or removal. The members of the board of managers of Merger Sub immediately 
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial members of the board of
managers of the Surviving Company, each such member of the board of managers
to hold such position in accordance with the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving  Company and until such member's successor is duly
appointed and qualified, or such member's earlier death, resignation or
removal.

 

1.5 _Effect on the Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or  the Equityholders,
as the case may be:

 

(a) _Merger Sub_. Each unit of limited liability company interest in Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into and become one fully paid unit of limited  liability company
interest of the Surviving Company.

 

(b) _Interest_. The Interest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into and represent the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms hereof, the amount of the Merger  Consideration
allocated to such Interest pursuant to the Consideration Waterfall (subject to
_Section 1.8_). When converted in accordance with the  foregoing, all of such
Interest no longer will be outstanding and automatically will be cancelled and
retired.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Member shall cease to have  any
rights as a member of the Company or the Surviving Company, except as provided
herein or by Law. At the Effective Time, the interest ledger of the Company
shall be closed and no transfer of any Interest shall thereafter be made.

 

1.6 _CHP Common Units and Options_.

 

(a) The board of managers of CHP has adopted resolutions and, prior to 
Closing, will take, and the Company will take or cause to be taken, all other
actions necessary and appropriate, to provide that all CHP Common Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be redeemed and
cancelled effective as of  immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration
allocated to such holders of CHP Common Units pursuant to the Consideration
Waterfall (subject to _Section 1.8_).

 

(b) The board of managers of CHP has adopted resolutions and, prior to 
Closing, will take, and the Company will take or cause to be taken, all other
actions necessary and appropriate, to provide that (i) all outstanding vested
Options immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be redeemed and
cancelled effective as  of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration
allocated to such Optionholder pursuant to the Consideration Waterfall (the "
_Aggregate Option Cash Out Payment_ ") (subject to _Section 1.8_), which for
the avoidance of  doubt, with respect to each such Optionholder, shall be
reduced by the aggregate exercise price of the applicable vested Options and
(ii) all outstanding unvested Options immediately prior to the Effective Time
will immediately terminate effective  immediately prior to the Effective Time
and no longer will be outstanding and automatically will be cancelled and
retired. The portion of the Aggregate Option Cash Out Payment payable pursuant
to the Consideration Waterfall at the time of Closing is  referred to as the
" _Closing Option Cash Out Payment_ ". The taxable compensation of and/or
payment to any Optionholder shall be subject to any required  withholding of
Taxes in accordance with _Section 1.12_ and, to the extent such withholding of
Taxes is required, payments of such taxable compensation  shall be made via
the payroll of the applicable Group Company, consistent with past practices.

 

(c) Until an Optionholder, who is not a current employee  of any Group
Company and is entitled to any portion of the Aggregate Option Cash Out
Payment or any Other Equityholder Payments submits an instruction letter
(which instruction letter must be submitted within ninety (90) days after (i)
the Closing  Date with respect to the Aggregate Option Cash Out Payment or
(ii) the date any such Optionholder receives notice of the applicable Other
Equityholder Payment if not submitted pursuant to clause (i)), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to  Parent and the Company (an " _Instruction
Letter_ "), neither the applicable Group Company nor the Representative shall
be required to pay such Person the  cash to which it would otherwise have
been entitled; and any such forfeited amounts shall be paid by Parent, no
later than ten (10) Business Days following any such forfeiture, to the
account maintained by the Representative for purposes of holding  the
Representative Expense Fund Amount to be paid by the Representative, on a pro
rata basis (calculated by the  Representative with the removal of the
Optionholder who forfeited such payment), in accordance with _Section
10.12(b)_.

 

1.7 _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration in respect of the
Securities shall be an amount equal to (a) Eight Hundred Twenty Seven Million
Dollars ($827,000,000.00) (the " _Base Price_ "), _plus_ (b) the amount, if
any, by which the Working Capital exceeds  the Working Capital Target,
_minus_ (c) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds
the Working Capital, _plus_ (d) the Closing Cash, _minus_ (e) Closing Date
Indebtedness, _minus_ (f) Transaction Expenses (such resulting amount pursuant
to clauses (a)-(f), and as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 1.10_ , the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger 
Consideration shall be allocated among the Equityholders in accordance with
the Consideration Waterfall set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement delivered
pursuant to _Section  1.10_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any Liability to any Person relating to, or
obligation to verify, the allocation of the Merger Consideration among the
Equityholders as set forth in  the Pre-Closing Statement, and upon payment of
the amounts set forth in _Section 1.9_ in accordance with the Pre-Closing
Statement, Parent, Merger Sub  and the Surviving Company will have satisfied
all of their respective obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto,
subject to any adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.10_.

 

1.8 _Adjustment Escrow Amount and Representative Expense Amount Fund
Contributions_. The Adjustment Escrow Amount and the initial amount of
Representative Expense Fund Amount funded at Closing shall be withheld  from
each Equityholder's portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration based on
each Equityholder's applicable Pro Rata Share. Each Equityholder shall retain
the right to receive in the future an amount, if any and as determined in
accordance with  the terms of this Agreement, equal to such Equityholder's
applicable portion of future distributions, if any, from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Representative Expense Fund Amount based on such Equityholder's
applicable Pro Rata Share. For Tax  purposes, the Parties agree to treat the
Representative Expense Fund Amount as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Equityholders at the time of Closing.

 

1.9 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, Parent shall make or cause to be made,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the following payments (each
such payment, a " _Closing Payment_ "):

 

(a) payment to the account designated by a paying agent selected by the 
Representative with Parent's prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) (the " _Paying Agent_ ") of a cash amount equal to
the  aggregate amount of the Estimated Merger Consideration payable to the
Member and any CHP Members in accordance with _Section 1.5_ and _Section 1.6_
, including as subject to withholding of the items set forth in _Section 1.8_
and as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement to be distributed by the Paying
Agent to the Member and CHP Members in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ , less
the Closing Option Cash Out Payment, which shall be paid to Centauri, LLC
pursuant to _Section 1.9(b)_ ;  _provided_ , that if the Member or any CHP
Member has not delivered to the Representative and Parent a duly executed and
completed Letter of Transmittal  prior to the Closing Date, the amount
allocated with respect to the Member or such CHP Member will be paid to the
Paying Agent on behalf of the Member or such CHP Member (and distributed
thereto upon delivery of such executed and completed Letter of  Transmittal).

 

(b) payment to Centauri, LLC (on behalf of the Optionholders) of the  Closing
Option Cash Out Payment as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement to the bank
account designated in writing by the Representative, which amount shall be
paid by Centauri, LLC through its payroll system to the applicable
Optionholders (subject  to applicable withholding Tax), allocated to each
Optionholder in accordance with the Pre-Closing Statement no later than the
later of (i) the fifth (5th) day following receipt by Centauri, LLC of such
payment and (ii) the next regularly scheduled  pay date for employees of
Centauri, LLC, subject to any Optionholder who is not a current employee
delivering to the Surviving Company a duly completed and executed Instruction
Letter, at least two (2) Business Days prior to such time;

 

(c) payment to the Representative of a cash amount equal to  $8,000,000.00
(such amount, the " _Representative Expense Fund Amount_ ") to a bank account
designated in writing by the Representative;

 

(d) payment to the Escrow Agent of a cash amount equal to the  Adjustment
Escrow Amount, to the bank account designated in writing by the Escrow Agent,
which shall be deposited into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow 
Account_ ") established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and

 

(e) payment on behalf of the Group Companies, (i) to the payees thereof  if
applicable, of an aggregate cash amount equal to the amount of all Closing
Date Indebtedness of the type identified in items (i) and (ii) of the
definition of "Indebtedness" as indicated in payoff letters from the holders
thereof (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), and (ii) all Transaction Expenses for which
the Company has delivered to Parent an invoice and payment instructions;

 

_provided_ , _however_ , if Closing Cash exceeds $2,000,000, the Company will
use any amounts of Closing Cash in excess of $2,000,000  to pay such cash to
the respective payees identified in this _Section 1.9_ , as applicable, in
respect of first, Transaction Expenses; second, the  Closing Option Cash Out
Payment; and third, the Payoff Amount, and Parent shall have no obligation
pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ of this sentence to  pay such portion of such
Transaction Expenses, Closing Option Cash Out Payment, or Payoff Amount to
which such Closing Cash is applied.

 

Each of the Closing Payments shall be made in the amounts and as set forth in
the Pre-Closing Statement  delivered pursuant to _Section 1.10_ below.

 

1.10 _Adjustment of the Merger Consideratio_ _n_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Statement_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the
" _Pre-Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Company's good faith estimate
of the Merger Consideration as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Estimated Merger
Consideration_ "), together with an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
the Group Companies as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), expected month-end closing revenue and closing cost of
sales (or if Closing is not to occur at the end of a month, a good faith
estimate of such amounts), and reasonably  detailed calculations
demonstrating each component thereof (including the Consideration Waterfall),
as well as the amount of each Closing Payment. The Pre-Closing Statement shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the definitions of the terms  Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the
Accounting Rules and practices referred to therein (including as reflected on
_Exhibit  B_ ). Parent shall be entitled to review promptly the Pre-Closing
Statement and the materials and information used by the Company in preparing
the Pre-Closing Statement and Parent shall have the opportunity to propose
changes to the  Pre-Closing Statement. The Company (i) shall permit Parent
and its Agents reasonable access to the financial records of the Group
Companies that are relevant to the preparation of the Pre-Closing Statement
and (B) agrees to consider any proposed  changes in good faith. If, prior to
the Closing, Parent reasonably and in good faith objects to any of the
estimates provided by the Company in the Pre-Closing Statement, and the
Company objects to such proposed changes, the Company shall respond in 
writing to Parent's proposed changes in reasonable detail and with reasonably
detailed calculations. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly and in good faith resolve their differences with respect
to any such objections,  and the Company shall revise the Pre-Closing
Statement, the Estimated Merger Consideration, and any applicable amounts set
forth therein to reflect any such resolutions, and the Pre-Closing Statement
(and components thereof) shall be deemed to  incorporate all such revisions
for all purposes hereunder. If following compliance with this _Section
1.10(a)_ , Parent and the Company fail to resolve  an objection to the
estimate within the five (5) Business Day period prior to Closing then for
purposes of this Agreement, including the revised Pre-Closing Statement, such
estimate for the unresolved item shall be deemed to be the estimate of the 
Company provided in the originally-delivered Pre-Closing Statement. Acceptance
of the Pre-Closing Statement shall not waive Parent's rights under this
Agreement including this _Section 1.10_. The Consideration Waterfall shall set
forth the amount of the Estimated Merger Consideration to be  paid to each
Equityholder as Closing Payments pursuant to _Section 1.9(a)_ and _Section
1.9(b)_. Parent may fully rely on the Pre-Closing Statement in making such
Closing Payments to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Member and the CHP
Members and Centauri, LLC on behalf of the  Optionholders. Such Closing
Payments made in accordance with the Pre-Closing Statement shall fully satisfy
Parent's obligations under _Section 1.9(a)_   and _Section 1.9(b)_ , and no
Equityholder shall have any claim or right to any other payment whatsoever
from Parent or the Surviving Company in respect  of its Securities, other
than payments, if any, contemplated by _Section 1.10(e)_, and the release, if
any, of the Adjustment Escrow Amount or the  Representative Expense Fund
Amount.

 

(b) _Final Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted following the Closing based on the difference between the Final
Closing Date Merger Consideration (as determined in accordance  with this
_Section 1.10_ ) and the Estimated Merger Consideration, if any, and payment
shall be made in respect of any such post-Closing adjustment as  set forth in
_Section 1.10(e)_ ; _provided_ , however,  for purposes of calculating the
Final Closing Date Merger Consideration, the absolute value of any adjustment
pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)_ or _Section 1.7(c)_ shall not exceed Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

 

(c) _Closing Statement_. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered to the
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Parent's calculation of the Merger Consideration as of the Adjustment Time ("
_Closing Date Merger Consideration_ ") and an unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Group Companies as of the Adjustment Time. The Closing Statement
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the  definitions of the terms
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses
and the Accounting Rules and practices referred to therein (including as
reflected on _Exhibit B_ ). The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing
the Closing Statement and determining the Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses is to measure the amount 
of the Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses and such processes are not intended to permit the
introduction of different or new judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures,  classifications or estimation
methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement or
determining the Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses. The Closing Statement shall entirely disregard (i) any 
and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Group Companies as a
result of the Transactions or of any financing or refinancing arrangements
entered into at any time by Parent or its Affiliates or any other transaction
entered into by Parent  or its Affiliates in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions, and (ii) any facts or circumstances that are unique or
particular to Parent or its Affiliates or any of their assets or liabilities.
For the avoidance of doubt, unless the  Representative otherwise agrees in
writing, Parent may not amend, adjust, supplement or modify the Closing
Statement or the amount of Closing Date Merger Consideration following its
delivery to the Representative. If Parent fails to deliver the  Closing
Statement within such ninety (90)-day period, then in addition to any other
rights the Representative may have under this Agreement, the Representative
shall have the right to elect that the Estimated Merger Consideration be
deemed to be the  amount of the Closing Date Merger Consideration and be
final and binding and used for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant
to _Section 1.10(e)_.  The Parties acknowledge that no adjustments may be
made to the Working Capital Target.

 

(d) _Disputes_.

 

        

(i)

    |  

The Representative shall have forty-five (45) days to review the Closing
Statement. If the Representative  disagrees with Parent's calculation of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement, the
Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing
Statement, deliver a written notice to Parent  (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
disagreeing with such calculation and, to the extent reasonably able to so
specify, setting forth the Representative's  basis for such disagreement with
reasonable supporting documentation (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If the
Representative fails to deliver a Dispute  Notice during such forty-five
(45)-day period, the Representative shall have waived its rights to contest
the Closing Statement and the calculations of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration set forth therein shall be deemed to be final and  binding upon
the Parties, and such amount shall be used as the Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration for purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to _Section
1.10(e)_. If the Representative delivers a Dispute Notice and the Dispute
Notice does not specifically object to an item included in the Closing
Statement, the Representative shall be deemed to  have accepted Parent's
calculation and presentation of that item and the item shall not be considered
a Disputed Item.

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |  

If a Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 1.10(d)(i)_, the
Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, attempt to reach an agreement on all or a portion of the Disputed
Items. If Parent and  the Representative reach an agreement on any Disputed
Item during such period, the resolution of such Disputed Items shall be in
writing and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If, during such
thirty (30)-day period, the  Representative and Parent are unable to reach an
agreement on all of the Disputed Items, then all Disputed Items remaining in
dispute following such thirty (30)-day period shall be submitted by the
Representative and Parent to the Accounting  Referee (the " _Referred
Disputed Items_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable for a determination
resolving such Referred Disputed Items (it  being agreed and understood that
the Accounting Referee shall act as an arbitrator to determine the Referred
Disputed Items (and, as a result thereof, the Closing Date Merger
Consideration) and shall do so based solely on presentations and  information
provided by Parent and the Representative, as further specified below, and not
by independent review). In conducting its review, the decision of the
Accounting Referee shall be solely based on (A) the definitions and other 
applicable provisions of this Agreement, (B) a single presentation by each of
the Representative and Parent limited to the Referred Disputed Items (which
presentations the Accounting Referee shall be instructed to forward to Parent
and the  Representative, as applicable) and (C) one (1) written response
submitted to the Accounting Referee by each of the Representative and Parent
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation (which
responses the Accounting  Referee shall be instructed to forward to Parent
and the Representative, as applicable), and not on independent review. The
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Referee shall be
limited to resolving the Referred Disputed  Items, and, in connection
therewith, fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the Referred
Disputed Items were determined in accordance with this Agreement (including
the definition of the terms Working Capital, Closing Cash,  Closing Date
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and the Accounting Rules) and the
Accounting Referee is not to make any other determination. In resolving any
Referred Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee shall not assign a value to
any  item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party.
The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the Representative and Parent, as
promptly as  practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from
the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth its
calculations of the Closing Date Merger Consideration based solely upon (x)
the Accounting  Referee's final determination of the Referred Disputed Items
and (y) the items which were finally determined pursuant to pursuant to
_Sections 1.10(d)(i)_   and _1.10(d)(ii)_ and not submitted to the Accounting
Referee for resolution, which such Closing Date Merger Consideration amount
shall not be  less than the applicable amount thereof shown in Parent's
calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 1.10(c)_ nor more than the amount
thereof  shown in the Representative's calculation delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.10(d)(i)_. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
Parties,  absent manifest error, and shall be used for purposes of
calculating the adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.10(b)_ above.
Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this _Section 1.10(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
mechanism  for resolving disputes regarding the Merger Consideration
adjustment. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Referee in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such
determination is to be enforced.  The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the Representative in
proportion to the relative amount each such Party's determination has been
modified, with any amount borne by the Representative to be  paid out of the
Representative Expense Fund Amount. For example, if the Representative
challenges the calculation of the Closing Date Merger Consideration by an
amount of $100,000, but the Accounting Referee determines that the
Representative  has a valid claim for only $60,000, the Representative (on
behalf of the Equityholders) shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee and Parent shall bear the other 60% of such fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee.  The Representative and Parent shall, and
Parent shall cause the Group Companies, and each of its and their
representatives to, reasonably cooperate and assist in any review by the
Accounting Referee of the Closing Statement and the  calculations of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration.

    
---|--- 
    

 

(e) _Final Closing Date Merger Consideration_. Following the time that the
Closing Date Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.10_ (such finally determined amount, the " _Final Closing Date
Merger Consideration_ "), payment shall  be made as follows:

 

        

(i)

    |  

If the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration is greater than or equal to the
Estimated Merger  Consideration (the amount of such excess, the " _Increase
Amount_ "), then within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date
Merger  Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.10_,
(x) Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds an 
amount equal to the Increase Amount (for further distribution to the Member
and CHP Members) and Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then responsible
for payroll) (for further distribution to the Optionholders) in accordance
with _Section 1.11_ , and (y) Parent and the Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to  disburse the Adjustment Escrow Funds to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the Member and CHP Members) and Centauri, LLC (or the Parent
Affiliate then responsible for payroll) (for further distribution to the
Optionholders) in  accordance with _Section 1.11_.

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |  

If the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Merger Consideration (the amount  of such deficit, the " _Decrease Amount_
"), then within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration is finally  determined pursuant to this _Section 1.10_ , (A)
Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent  instructing the Escrow Agent to (x) disburse to an account
designated in writing by Parent all or a portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Funds equal to the Decrease Amount, and (y) disburse in accordance with
_Section 1.11_ to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Member and
CHP Members) and the Surviving Company (for further distribution to the
Optionholders) in  accordance with _Section 1.11_ the balance of the
Adjustment Escrow Funds, if any, remaining after payment to Parent pursuant to
the preceding  clause (x), and (B) if the Adjustment Escrow Funds are less
than the Decrease Amount, the Representative, solely in its capacity as
Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, shall pay an amount equal to
such deficit to an account  designated in writing by Parent.

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(iii)

    |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.10(e)_ , if, at
the time that Parent is required to make any payments to the Paying Agent (on
behalf of the Member or CHP Members) or Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate
then  responsible for payroll) (on behalf of the Optionholders) pursuant to
this _Section 1.10(e)_ , (A) the Member or any CHP Member who has not 
delivered to the Representative and Parent a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal, and any Optionholder who is not a current employee and
who has not delivered to the Surviving Company a duly completed and executed
Instruction  Letter, in each case in accordance with the instructions therein
and any other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, then the amount allocated with respect to such Equityholder will
be paid to the Paying Agent  or Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then
responsible for payroll), as applicable, on behalf of such Equityholder (and
distributed thereto upon delivery of such executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal or Instruction Letter, as  applicable).

    
---|--- 
    

 

Upon payment of the amounts provided in this _Section 1.10(e)_ in accordance
herewith, none of the Parties may make or assert any claim under this _Section
1.10_.

 

(f) _Cooperation_. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the final determination and payment of the Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 1.10_ , Parent shall afford,
and shall cause the Group Companies to afford, to the Representative and any
accountants, counsel or financial or other  advisers retained by the
Representative in connection with the review of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration, and afford to the Accounting Referee in connection with any
review by it in accordance with _Section 1.10(d)(ii)_, reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the books,
properties, records, contracts, documents, information, personnel and 
representatives of the Group Companies and their accountants (including the
work papers of the Surviving Company's accountants) relevant to the review or
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date
Merger  Consideration and, if requested by the Representative, shall provide
any such books, records, contracts, documents and information electronically
and in the format that such books, records, contracts, documents and
information of the Group Companies  are maintained in the ordinary course of
business (subject to reasonable confidentiality restrictions and to providing
such assurances, releases, indemnities or other agreements as accountants may
customarily require in such circumstances). The  determination of the Closing
Date Merger Consideration shall not take into account any developments or
events taking place after the Closing Date or any actions taken by Parent on
its own behalf or on behalf of any Group Company on or following the  Closing
Date.

 

1.11 _Other Payments_. In order to facilitate the payment of any Other
Equityholder Payments pursuant to this Agreement:

 

(a) the Member's and CHP Members' aggregate Pro Rata Share of such  funds
shall be paid to an account designated by the Paying Agent (on behalf of the
Member and the CHP Members) for distribution to the Member and CHP Members
entitled thereto on a pro rata basis (based on each Member's or CHP Member's
Pro Rata  Share), subject to the Member and such CHP Members delivering to
the Representative and Parent a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal prior to such time; and

 

(b) the Optionholders' aggregate Pro Rata Share of such funds shall be  paid
to Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then responsible for payroll) for
further distribution to the Optionholders on a pro rata basis (based on each
Optionholder's Pro Rata Share), subject to applicable withholding Tax, through
the payroll  system of Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then
responsible for payroll) no later than the later of (i) the fifth (5th)
Business Day following receipt by Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then
responsible for payroll) of such payment and  (ii) the next regularly
scheduled pay date for employees of Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate
then responsible for payroll), subject to such Optionholders who are no longer
employees delivering to the Surviving Company a duly completed and  executed
Instruction Letter prior to such time.

 

The Parties acknowledge and agree neither Parent nor Centauri, LLC (or the
Parent  Affiliate then responsible for payroll) shall have any Liability to
any Person relating to, or obligation to verify, the allocation of any Other
Equityholder Payment among the Equityholders as set forth in this _Section
1.11_ , and upon payment of any Other Equityholder Payment in accordance with
this _Section  1.11_ or as directed by the Representative, Parent and
Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then responsible for payroll) will have
satisfied all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto.

 

Parent further acknowledges that it shall cause Centauri, LLC (or the Parent
Affiliate  then responsible for payroll) to perform its obligations under
this Agreement after the Effective Time and shall be responsible for any
breach by Centauri, LLC (or the Parent Affiliate then responsible for payroll)
of any such obligations.

 

1.12 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, Centauri, LLC (or the Parent
Affiliate then responsible for payroll), Escrow Agent and any other
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts 
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments
under any provision of applicable Tax Law. Before making any such deduction or
withholding  described in the previous sentence, except for any withholding
on compensatory payments made in connection with the Transactions, Parent
shall give the Representative notice of the intention to make such deduction
or withholding, which notice shall  include the authority, basis and method
of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, at least three (3)
Business Days before such deduction or withholding is required, in order for
the Representative to obtain reduction of or relief from  such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or other
withholding agent and paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid  to the recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or other withholding agent.

 

1.13 _Letters of Transmittal_.

 

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, and no later than ten (10)  Business
Days following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each Member and
CHP Member a Letter of Transmittal in the form of _Exhibit C_  hereto (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and to each Optionholder who is no longer an
employee an Instruction Letter. Promptly following the receipt by the  Paying
Agent of the Closing Payment contemplated _Section 1.9(a)_ , the Paying Agent
shall deliver to each Member and CHP Member who delivered to the 
Representative and Parent a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date in accordance with
the instructions therein and any other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such  instructions the portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration allocated to each such Equityholder in accordance with the Pre-
Closing Statement and to the bank account designated in the Member's or such
CHP Member's Letter of Transmittal. Following  the Closing, but subject to
_Section 1.13(b)_ , upon delivery by a Member or CHP Member that did not
receive such portion of the Closing Payment  contemplated by _Section 1.9(a)_
at the Closing pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the
Representative and Parent of a duly completed and  executed Letter of
Transmittal in accordance with the instructions therein and any other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
Paying Agent shall pay to the Member or such CHP Member within five (5)
Business Days  after such delivery, (x) the amounts to which the Member or
such CHP Member is entitled to pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
and (y) if the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration has been finally
determined as of such time, the amounts  to which the Member or such CHP
Member is entitled to pursuant to _Section 1.11(a)_, in each case, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to  the account designated by the
Member or such CHP Member in the Member's or such CHP Member's Letter of
Transmittal. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable to the Member, any CHP Member or any Optionholder 
hereunder. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 1.13_ , the Interest and the CHP Common Units shall represent, for
all  purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereto
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Promptly following the date that is one (1) year after the Closing  Date,
Parent may instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Company all
cash delivered to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement that is still in
its possession at such time, in which case the Paying Agent's duties shall
terminate.  Thereafter, each Member or CHP Member may deliver a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the
instructions therein and any other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions to the Surviving  Company and (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive in
consideration therefor, and the Surviving Company shall promptly pay, the
portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable to the Member or such CHP
Member in  respect of its Interest or CHP Common Units as determined in
accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ without any interest thereon.

 

1.14 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE
I_ , none of the Company, Parent, the  Representative or the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any Person for any amount delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any amounts payable in accordance with this _ARTICLE I_ would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,  immediately prior
to the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, will become the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously  entitled thereto.

 

ARTICLE II 
  
  
  CLOSING

 

2.1 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions (the " _Closing_ ")

conditions at the Closing) (the date on which the Closing actually occurs, the
" _Closing Date_ "). The Parties shall use  their reasonable best efforts to

substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_, executed in
accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions

Schedule_ "), which is subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth
in _Section 11.2(c)_ , the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Power_. Each of the Group Companies is a corporation or
other legal entity duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of formation or  organization. Each
of the Group Companies is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the character or location
of any properties or assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or 
qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the requisite power and
authority to execute  and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction
Agreement to which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the Transactions. Each of the Group Companies has
the power and authority to own or lease  all of its properties and assets and

respects.

 

3.2 _Authorization of Agreement_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements to which  the
Company is a party, the performance by the Company of its obligations
thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized
by the requisite corporate action on the part of the Company. Each of the
Transaction Agreements  to which the Company is a party has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto) each such
Transaction Agreement, when so executed and delivered,  will constitute, the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable Equitable Principles. The
board of managers of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at  which
all managers of the Company were present or by written consent, as applicable,
duly adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement,
the Merger and the Transactions, (ii) determining that this Agreement, the
Merger and  the Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Member, and (iii) resolving to recommend the approval of this Agreement to the
Member of the Company, which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded,

redemption (collectively the " _CHP Transactions_ "), have been duly
authorized by the requisite corporate action on the part of CHP.  Other than
the resolutions of the board of managers of CHP contemplated by _Section 1.6_
, no other proceeding on the part of CHP (including by its  equityholders) or
the Optionholders is necessary to authorize or consummate the CHP
Transactions. The board of managers of CHP, at a meeting duly called and held

(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, (ii) give rise to a
right of termination, acceleration,  modification or cancellation under,

Schedule, each Person who is involved in the creation or development of any
Intellectual Property Rights for or otherwise for the benefit of any Group 
Company (" _IP Contributor_ ") has executed and delivered to the applicable

confidentiality and assignment agreement effectively assigning to such Group
Company all Intellectual Property Rights that were or are created or developed
by such IP Contributor in the course of activities conducted with or for the

Existing Intellectual Property Rights licensed by contractors to Group
Companies under such Group  Companies' written agreement with such
contractors, no Intellectual Property Rights of any IP Contributor are used in
or required for the conduct of the business of the Group Companies as now
conducted. Each current and former employee,  consultant and contractor of
each Group Company who has or had access to any confidential or proprietary
information of any Group Company (or of third parties that has been disclosed
to any Group Company under an obligation of  confidentiality) has executed
and delivered a valid and enforceable agreement under which the employee,
consultant or contractor agrees not to use or disclose any confidential or
proprietary information of any Group Company (or of third  parties that has
been disclosed to any Group Company under an obligation of confidentiality)
except as explicitly authorized by the Group Company. No IP Contributor or
other current or former employee, consultant and contractor of any Group 
Company has breached or violated any of the agreements referenced in this
_Section 3.16(b)(ii)_ ;

each Group Company has taken all reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of and otherwise protect  and enforce its rights in all Trade
Secrets and other proprietary or confidential information pertaining to the
Group Companies, the Company Intellectual Property, or the business of any of

conduct of  the business of the Group Companies as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted following the Closing; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(x)

    |  

no Group Company is, or ever was, a member or promoter of, or a contributor
to, any industry standards body  or similar organization that could require

(c) All Company-Owned Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and 
enforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 

        

(i)

    |  

no Company-Owned Intellectual Property conflicts or interferes with any
Intellectual Property Right owned,  used or for which registration has been
applied for by any other Person, and each Group Company has taken reasonable
steps to police the use of the Company-Owned Intellectual Property and to
protect the Company-Owned Intellectual Property  against third party
infringement, violation, misappropriation or dilution, as applicable;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |

validity or enforceability of any Registered Intellectual Property is or has
been pending or threatened, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for any such claim;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(iv)

    |  

no act has been done or omitted to be done by any Group Company, which has
had, or would reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, the effect of impairing or dedicating to the public, or entitling
any Person to cancel, forfeit, modify or consider abandoned, any Company-Owned
Intellectual Property or give any Person any  rights with respect thereto;
and

    
---|---

(d) _Section 3.16(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list of (i) all Contracts containing licenses, covenants not to
assert or enforce, or any other right to use or exploit any  Company
Intellectual Property that are granted by any Group Company to any third
party, excluding non-exclusive licenses granted to customers in the Ordinary
Course of Business, non-exclusive licenses granted to customers in respect of
work product  generated under Government Contracts and non-exclusive licenses
granted to third parties in a prime contractor/subcontractor relationship with
a Group Company solely for purposes of performing under the applicable
Government Contract, and (ii) all  Contracts containing licenses, covenants
not to assert or enforce, or any other right to use or exploit any
Intellectual Property Rights owned by a third party and granted by any Person
to any Group Company, excluding (A) Contracts under which (x)  any Group
Company licenses generally and commercially available Software in object code
form (e.g., "off-the-shelf" or "shrink wrap" licenses), and (y) the expenses
of any Group Company do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate during the twelve
(12)  month period preceding the Closing Date, or (B) non-exclusive licenses
granted to a Group Company in respect of work performed under Government
Contracts and (C) non-exclusive licenses granted to a Group Company by third
parties in a prime  contractor/subcontractor relationship with such Group
Company solely for purposes of performing under the applicable Government
Contract (each item required to be so listed pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _IP Licenses_ "). The Group Companies have made available
to Parent true and complete copies of all IP Licenses. The Group Companies
have and, to the Knowledge of the Company,  each counterparty thereto has,
performed all obligations required to be performed as of the Closing Date
under the IP Licenses. Neither any Group Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any counterparty to any IP License is in default of any IP  License.
There is no outstanding or threatened dispute or disagreement with respect to
any IP License, and the Transactions will not afford any counterparty to any
IP License the right to terminate such IP License. No IP License pursuant to
which any  Group Company grants a license under any Company Intellectual
Property to any Person includes the grant of any license authorizing the
practice of such Intellectual Property Rights in a manner that is broader in
scope, longer in duration or otherwise  inconsistent in any manner with the
manner in which the applicable Company Intellectual Property is licensed (if
applicable) by the applicable Group Company from a third party under an IP
License, except to the extent such Person has its own license  or other
permission that permits the practice of such Intellectual Property Rights in
such inconsistent manner.

 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed upon, 
misappropriated, made unlawful use of or violated, and no Person is currently
infringing upon, misappropriating, making unlawful use of or violating, any
Company Intellectual Property that is owned by or exclusively licensed to any
Group Company. _Section 3.16(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
true and complete list of (and the Company has made available to Parent a true
and complete  copy of) each letter or other written or electronic
communication or correspondence that has been sent by any Group Company or any
representative of any Group Company regarding any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misuse, misappropriation  or other violation of any Company
Intellectual Property, and provides a brief description of the current status
of the matter referred to in such letter, communication or correspondence.

 

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 3.16(f)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or to the extent instructed in writing by a customer of a Group
Company pursuant to a Government Contract under which the applicable 
Governmental Authority is obligated to indemnify such Group Company therefor,
no Group Company has ever violated, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
made unlawful use (directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise) of
any Intellectual  Property Rights of any other Person, and neither the
operation of the business of the Group Companies (including the marketing,
sale and distribution of the Group Company Products), nor the use of the
Company Intellectual Property, is violating,  infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise making unlawful use of any Intellectual Property Rights
of any other Person. Except as set forth on _Section  3.16(f)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no Group Company has within the last three (3)
years (i) received any written notice from any Person claiming any violation,
infringement, misappropriation or other unlawful use by any  Group Company or
any customer of a Group Company Product of another Person's Intellectual
Property Rights (including any "unsolicited offers" to license Intellectual
Property Rights from another Person); or (ii) received any written notice or
other  claim from any Person, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Legal
Proceeding is pending, alleging that any Group Company (including any
employee, contractor, or consultant of any Group Company in their capacity as
such) has engaged in any  activity or conduct that constitutes the
unauthorized use of, or that has violated, infringed or misappropriated, the
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, and, to the Company's Knowledge,
there is no basis for any such Legal Proceeding.

 

(g) Except to the extent (i) instructed in writing by a customer or 
otherwise pursuant to the requirements of the applicable Government Contract
under which Company Software was developed by a Group Company for such
customer and (ii) consistent with the intended use of such Company Software by
such customer, or as  set forth on _Section 3.16(g)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company Software (including web sites,
smartphone or tablet applications,  HTML code and firmware and other Software
embedded in hardware devices) owned or developed (or currently being
developed), by or for any Group Company contains any "back door," "drop dead
device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus" or "worm" (as  such terms are
commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code designed or
intended to have, or capable of performing, any of the following functions:
(A) disrupting, disabling, harming or otherwise impeding in any manner the 
operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer system or
network or other device on which such code is stored or installed; (B)
damaging or destroying any data or file without the user's consent; or (C)
transmitting data, in each case,  either automatically, with the passage of
time or upon command by any Person other than the proper user.

 

(h) Except to the extent (i) instructed in writing by a customer or 
otherwise pursuant to the requirements of the applicable Government Contract

such customer, or as set  forth on _Section 3.16(h)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company Software: (A) contains any material
bug, defect, virus, malware or  error (including any bug, defect or error
relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage,
transmission or use of data) that adversely affects the use, functionality or
performance of such Company Software or any product  or system containing or
used in conjunction with such Company Software; or (B) fails to comply in any
material respect with any applicable warranty or other contractual commitment
relating to the use, functionality or performance of such Company  Software
or any product or system containing or used in conjunction with such Company
Software.

 

(i) The source code for all Company Software is sufficient for a  programmer
of reasonable skill and competence to understand, analyze and interpret
program logic, correct errors and improve, enhance, modify and support the
Company Software. Except to the extent required pursuant to a Government
Contract with a  customer under which a Group Company develops Company
Software exclusively for Governmental Authorities pursuant to Government
Contracts, (i) no source code for any Company Software has been delivered,
licensed or made available to any escrow agent  or other Person who is not,
as of the date of this Agreement, an employee or contractor of a Group Company
subject to a binding, written agreement imposing on such employee or
contractor reasonable confidentiality obligations in favor of the  applicable
Group Company with respect to such source code, (ii) no Group Company has any
duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise ) to deliver,
license or make available the source code for any Company Software to any
escrow agent  or other Person and (iii) no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the
delivery, license or disclosure of the source  code for any Company Software
to any other Person other than an employee of an Group Company, in connection
with such Group Company employee's employment or other service relationship
with the applicable Group Company and subject to a binding,  written
agreement imposing on such employee reasonable and adequate confidentiality
obligations in favor of the applicable Group Company with respect to such
source code.

 

(j) Except pursuant to the requirements of a Government Contract or as 
instructed in writing by a customer of a Government Contract with respect to

has: (i) incorporated Open Source Code into, or combined Open Source Code
with, any Group Company Product; (ii) distributed Open Source Code in
conjunction with or for use  with any Group Company Product or Company
Software; or (iii) used any Open Source Code in connection with any Group
Company Product or Company Software. The Group Companies' use, marketing,
distribution, licensing, making available and sale of Group  Company Products
and Company Software is in material compliance with all Open Source Licenses
applicable thereto. For clarity, material compliance shall include, without
limitation, full compliance with (A) all copyright notice, license notice
and  attribution requirements, and (B) all other requirements that must be
complied with in order to avoid the imposition of any of the circumstances
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of "Copyleft License."

 

(k) Neither the execution, delivery and performance by any Group  Company of
this Agreement and each of the other agreements, instruments and documents to
which the Group Companies are or will be a party in connection with the
Merger, nor the consummation of the Merger, will, with or without notice or
lapse of  time, result in or give any third party the right or option to
cause or declare: (i) a loss of, or Lien on, any Company Intellectual
Property; (ii) a breach of or default under any IP License; (iii) a payment or
increased royalty or an obligation to  offer any discount or be bound by any

to, or otherwise  have any Liability in respect of any (i) "employee pension

Benefit Plan.

 

(f) None of the Benefit Plans provide or have promised to provide  retiree
health or welfare insurance benefits to any current or former employee or

4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any similar Law
requiring  group health plan continuation coverage.

 

(g) Except as set forth on _Section 3.17(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the

indebtedness, vesting, distribution, or increase in compensation or benefits
under or with respect to any Benefit Plan; (ii) require any contributions or
payments to fund  any obligations under any Benefit Plan; or (iii) otherwise
trigger any acceleration of the time of funding, vesting or payment of
benefits under or with respect to any Benefit Plan. No Group Company is a

prototype plan, an  opinion letter) from the IRS within the applicable
remedial amendment periods. No such determination letter or advisory letter
has been revoked, no Governmental Authority has threatened to revoke any such
determination letter or advisory letter, and,  to the Knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any such
Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
revocation.

 

(i) No Group Company has engaged in and, to the Knowledge of the  Company no
other "party in interest" as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA has engaged in
a "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975

no Governmental Approval is required on the part of either Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the execution and delivery by such Party of  the

Effect.

 

4.4 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, threatened or bona fide grounds for,
Legal Proceedings against Parent or Merger Sub or their  Affiliates that
would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, there is no outstanding material Order imposed
upon either Parent or Merger Sub or any of their assets or Affiliates, except
for  Legal Proceedings which, if adversely determined, would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.5 _Financial Capability_. Parent will have as of the Closing sufficient cash
on hand or other sources of immediately available funds to (i) pay the Merger

beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature  or (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in their respective
businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being

examination of available information relating to the Group Companies and their

enterprise or other entity organized, chartered or incorporated under the laws
of any country  other than the United States or its territories; or any
person who is not a citizen or national of the United States (each a "
_Foreign Interest_ "),  Parent agrees to mitigate such foreign ownership in
accordance with the NISPOM and as approved by the DCSA or any other CSA, as
applicable, so as not to compromise the Group Companies' facility security
clearances and the ability to perform under  classified contracts of the U.S.
Government. Parent holds facility clearances at the appropriate level of
classification necessary for each Group Company to continue to perform its
respective classified contracts, or will be willing to obtain a  facility
security clearance or be excluded in accordance with the NISPOM, in order for
the Group Companies to be able to continue to perform on classified contracts
of the U.S. Government. Parent further acknowledges that no Group Company
shall have  liability for any breach of any representation or warranty to the
extent such breach results from Parent or any of its Affiliates having any
direct or indirect foreign ownership that hasn't been disclosed and properly
mitigated under the NISPOM or  from Parent's inability to hold the necessary
level of clearance.

Sub Investigation_.

foregoing, or as to any other matter,  notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to Parent and/or Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates or

representations or warranties, or liability or responsibility therefor, are
hereby expressly disclaimed. In addition, each of Parent and Merger Sub

information (including, the teaser, "fire side chat" materials, and
confidential information memorandum prepared by the Group Companies, its
Affiliates and Jefferies, LLC),  statement, representation or warranty
furnished to or discovered by it or any of its Affiliates other than the

about the industries in which the Group Companies operate and is capable of

Parent and Merger Sub understands and agrees that the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective assets are being furnished "as is",

Nothing herein shall require the Company to obtain consent from Parent to do
any of the foregoing if  obtaining such consent, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel, would reasonably be expected to violate
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
give to Parent, directly or indirectly, rights  to control or direct the
operations of the Group Companies prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the
Closing Date, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions hereof, complete control and supervision of its 
respective operations. Any request for consent pursuant to this _Section 5.1_
may be made by e-mail to the following: Ryan McKenney (at
ryan.mckenney@kbr.com) (with a copy to Carine Stoick in accordance with the
contact information set forth in _Section 10.7_), and if no e-mail or other
written response is received by David Wodlinger (at
dwodlinger@arlingtoncap.com) and Robert Richards (at
robert.richards@centauricorp.com) (with a copy to Marisa C.  Terrenzi in
accordance with the contact information set forth in _Section 10.7_) within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of any such request, then such  matter will
be deemed to have received Parent's consent.

 

5.2 _Access  to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of  the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable advance notice, the Company shall provide to Parent and Parent's
authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to
books  and records of the Group Companies (including, without limitation, the
monthly and quarterly financial statements prepared in the Ordinary Course of
Business by the Group Companies as soon as reasonably practicable at the end
of each calendar month  or calendar quarter, as applicable), and with the
prior written consent of the Representative (which may be effected by email),
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, senior-level
employees relevant to consummating the Transactions,  including for post-
Closing planning purposes, offices, properties, and facilities (in all cases,
in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of any Group Company) for any reasonable purpose (provided, that
the  continuation of due diligence shall not be deemed a reasonable purpose).
All of such information shall be treated as confidential information pursuant
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose
any competitively sensitive information (except through a clean team agreement
arrangement) or disclose any other information to Parent or its
representatives if (x) such disclosure would be  reasonably likely to
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided further that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of any  attorney-client
or other legal privilege), (y) such disclosure would be reasonably likely to
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including
confidentiality agreement) entered into prior to the date hereof (provided 
further that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that will not contravene any applicable
Laws (such as through the use of a "clean team") or does not contravene any
fiduciary duty or  result in a breach of such agreement including using
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of any applicable third
party), or (z) if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation
or arbitration (in which case the  furnishing of information, documents or
records contemplated by this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall be subject to applicable
rules relating to discovery) (the  matters referred to in this sentence with
respect to any Person, the " _Access Limitations_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Access Limitations  shall not apply with respect to the
Company's delivery to Parent of the monthly and quarterly financial statements
in accordance with this _Section 5.2(a)_.  At or within five (5) Business
Days after the Closing, the Representative will deliver a copy of all
documents in the Data Room to Parent on compact disc, DVD or USB flash drive.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, in connection with any reasonable 
business purpose relating to the Company and the Transactions or otherwise
relating to the period prior to Closing solely with respect to the rights and
obligations  of the Equityholders in respect of their ownership or operation
of the Group Companies, including the determination of any matter relating to
the  rights or obligations of the Equityholders under this Agreement, upon
reasonable prior written request and subject to the Access Limitations, Parent
shall,  and shall cause the Group Companies to, afford the Representative and
its authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the books and records and, with the prior written consent of Parent
(which may be effected by  email), not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, the offices and properties of Parent and its
Affiliates in respect of the Group Companies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
(u) Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to contravene any
applicable Laws or fiduciary duty, (v) such requests shall not  unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (w)
the auditors and accountants of Parent or its Affiliates shall not be
obligated to make any work papers (to the extent such documents exist)
available to any  Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such auditors or accountants, (x) if the Parties are
in an adversarial relationship in  litigation or arbitration, the furnishing
of information, documents or records contemplated by this _Section 5.2(b)_
shall be instead subject to  applicable rules relating to discovery; and (y)
Parent may require the entry into a confidentiality agreement, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, if such an agreement is not already in place.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier  of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent hereby agrees that except for contact made in the ordinary
course of  business consistent with past practices and unrelated to the
Transactions (which the Company hereby agrees shall be permitted by or on
behalf of Parent or its Affiliates), it is not authorized to and shall not
(and shall not permit any of  its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to) contact any customer, supplier, distributor, officer, employee
or other material business relation of any Group Company regarding the
Transactions without the prior written consent of the  Company, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent acknowledges that if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and 
effect.

 

5.3 _Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Without prejudice to Parent's obligations set forth in _Section 5.3(d)_ ,
each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall use its respective commercially reasonable  efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable (i) to consummate and make effective the Transactions and (ii)  to
obtain all Governmental Approvals of any Governmental Antitrust Authority
required to be obtained or made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub, and their 
Affiliates shall not be required to defend, challenge, lift, mitigate, or
rescind the effect of any Legal Proceeding involving any Governmental
Antitrust Authority (including a private party challenge) adversely affecting
this Agreement or the  Transactions, including appealing any adverse court or
administrative decision; _provided_ , _further_ , the Company and its
Affiliates shall not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of any portion
of the business of the Group Companies or offer or grant any material
accommodation (financial or  otherwise) to any Person in order to satisfy
their obligations under this _Section 5.3_ unless Parent requests in writing
that the Company and its  Affiliates take such action and unless such action
is contingent on the closing of the Transactions.

 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall or shall cause its ultimate  parent
entity as that term is defined in the HSR Act to (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
of this Agreement) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")  the
notification and report form, if any, required for the Transactions and to
supply as promptly as practicable any supplemental information reasonably
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) as soon as
reasonably  practicable make all filings under the applicable Other
Competition Laws, if any, required for the Transactions, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the expiration or  termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act and the Other Competition Laws. Any such antitrust
notification and report form or filing shall be in substantial compliance with
the requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Other  Competition Laws, as
the case may be. All other regulatory filings shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of applicable Law. Each of Parent and the
Company shall furnish to the other Party such necessary information and
reasonable  assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act, the applicable Other Competition Laws or other applicable
Law, as the case may be. The Company  and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any reasonable inquiries or
reasonable requests for additional information from the FTC, the DOJ, other
Governmental Antitrust Authorities and any other Governmental  Authority
having jurisdiction.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in _Sections
5.3(a)_, _5.3(b)_ and _5.3(d)_ and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall each furnish to the  other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
this _Section 5.3_ and shall each  promptly provide counsel for the other
Party upon request with copies of all filings made by such Party, and all
correspondence between such Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, other Governmental Authority or, in  connection with any
proceeding by a private party, and any other information supplied by such
Party and such Party's Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust Authority or
other Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the 
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, no Party shall be obligated to share with the other Party the
HSR notification prepared in connection with the Transactions or any documents
that are produced  with an HSR notification that are or could be responsive
to Item 4(c) or Item 4(d) of the HSR notification. Subject to applicable Law,
the Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other Party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and  shall consider in good faith the views
of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written or, if reasonably
practicable, oral communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority or
other Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions.  Each of the
Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Antitrust
Authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
unless  it consults with the other Party in advance if reasonably practicable
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust Authority or
other Governmental Authority, gives the other Party or its legal counsel the
opportunity to attend and  participate. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 5.3_   as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, managers or directors of the recipient 
without the advance written consent of the Party providing such materials.
Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with each
other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments,  and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental
Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions
by or on behalf of any Party.

 

(d) Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all commercially 
reasonable actions, including agreeing to the disposition of assets of the
Group Companies or agreeing to amending or terminating existing licenses or
other agreements of the Group Companies, required by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority as a  condition to the granting of any Governmental
Approval necessary for the consummation of the Transactions or as may be
required to lift, vacate, reverse or resolve any legislative, administrative
or judicial action (including any suit instituted by  the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the Transactions that would otherwise reasonably be expected to materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions). Notwithstanding the  foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.3(d)_ , such actions do not include any of the
following: (i) divesting, selling, licensing or otherwise  disposing of, or
holding separate and agreeing to divest, sell, license, hold separate, or
otherwise dispose of, any entity, facility, equity holding or asset of Parent
or its Affiliates (excluding the Group Companies), (ii) terminating, amending
or  assigning any existing relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of Parent or its Affiliates (excluding the Group Companies), and
(iii) amending, assigning or terminating any existing licenses or other
agreements and entering into such new  licenses or other agreements (and, in
each case, entering into agreements with the relevant Governmental Antitrust
Authority giving effect thereto) of Parent or its Affiliates (excluding the
Group Companies). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  of this _Section
5.3(d)_ , Parent and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to agree to or take
any action required in _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(d)_ if such action,
individually or in the  aggregate with all other such actions taken together
(A) would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to (1) the Group
Companies or (2) Parent and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, or (B) involve a
material amount or portion of the assets or  business of the Group Companies,
taken as a whole.

 

(e) The filing fees under the HSR Act, Other Competition Laws and other 
applicable Laws, as well as the fees and disbursements of any economic advisor
jointly retained by the Parties in connection with any such filings and any
other filings with Governmental Authorities, shall be borne by Parent, with
fifty percent (50%)  of such fees reimbursed by the Company at the earlier of
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

(f) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during  the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries shall not take or agree
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the  parties from obtaining any Governmental Approval in connection
with the Transactions, including entering into an agreement to acquire
(whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise) any
material amounts of assets of or any  equity in any other Person or any
business or division thereof if such agreement would be reasonably expected to
cause the failure to obtain the Governmental Approval of the FTC or DOJ or any
other Governmental Antitrust Authority required in  connection with the
Transactions.

 

(g) Prior to or as soon as reasonably practicable following the  execution of
this Agreement, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
the Company, with Parent's cooperation, shall prepare and submit to the DCSA a
notification in accordance with Section 1-302(g) of the NISPOM, as
applicable.  Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall fully cooperate with
each other in communicating with DCSA regarding the operation of the business
of the Company pursuant to a Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence
mitigation proposal reasonably  acceptable to the parties in accordance with
NISPOM.

 

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this 
Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with Parent in the preparation of a
five (5)-day notification pursuant to 22 C.F.R. § 122.4(a) of the ITAR, with
such  notification to be submitted by Parent no later than five (5) Business
Days following the Closing.

 

(i) Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable  efforts
to obtain the consents and make the notifications set forth on _Section
3.3(a)(A)(2)_ and _Section 3.3(a)(B)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For
the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of any such consents shall not be a
condition to Closing.

 

5.4 _Confidentiality_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
information provided to it and its representatives in connection with this
Agreement (including _Section 5.2(a)_ hereof) and the Transactions is subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 21, 2020, by and
between KBR, Inc. and Centauri, LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the
terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent any
confidentiality agreements entered into in the past twelve (12) months with
any potential purchaser of any of the Group Companies are with the
Representative or any Affiliate of a Group Company (excluding  other Group
Companies), the Company shall cause the Representative or such Affiliate of
such Group Company to assign to the Company, on or prior to the Closing, the
Representative's, or such Affiliate's right, title and interest in, to and
under  such confidentiality agreements, to the extent such assignment is
permitted under the terms of such confidentiality agreements. Following the
Closing, (a) all confidential information of the Group Companies as of the
date of the Closing  will constitute confidential information of Parent (and
not any former Equityholder), irrespective of whether such confidential
information was identified or otherwise designated as "confidential," (b)
Parent will have no obligations whatsoever under  the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to such confidential information of the Group Companies
and (c) with respect to such confidential information of the Group Companies,
the Representative, and each former Equityholder who is not otherwise 
subject to confidentiality obligations entered into in connection with the
Transactions, will hold, and will take reasonable measures to cause their
respective stockholders, officers, directors, managers, counsel, advisors,
employees and any other  representatives to hold, such confidential
information in confidence, unless such information was or becomes generally
available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by the
Representative or any former Equityholder, or the  Representative or any
former Equityholder is legally required to disclose such confidential
information by Law or by legal process or in connection with an dispute
regarding the Transactions.

 

5.5 _Preservation of Records_. In addition to and not in limitation of the
provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_ , and  subject to any document retention or
destruction policies of any Group Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement, Parent agrees to preserve and keep the records relating to the
businesses of the Group Companies for a period of seven (7) years  from the
Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the
Representative as may be reasonably requested and to the extent consistent
with applicable Laws in connection with any insurance claims by, Legal
Proceedings (other than  Legal Proceedings between the Representative and
Parent related to this Agreement or the Transactions) or Tax audits against,
or governmental investigations of, the Group Companies or in order to enable
the Representative to comply with its  obligations under this Agreement and
each other Transaction Agreement.

 

5.6 _Publicity_. None of the Representative or, prior to the Closing, the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or, following the Closing, the
Surviving Company, on the other hand, shall issue any press  release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements or the Transactions or make any other public disclosure containing
or pertaining to the terms of this Agreement without obtaining the
Representative's or  Parent's, as applicable, prior written approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment
of the Party (or such Party's Affiliate) seeking to disclose, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or  by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which such disclosing Party (or such Party's Affiliate) lists
securities; _provided_ that, to the  extent any disclosure is required by
applicable Law or stock exchange rule, the Party (or such Party's Affiliate)
intending to make such disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with applicable Law or stock exchange rule to  consult
with the Representative or Parent, as applicable, with respect to the text
thereof and; _provided_ , _further_ , that (a) the Company and Representative,
on the one hand, and Parent and its equityholders and Affiliates, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to disclose such information (i) to  their respective
directors, officers, executive employees, equity owners, partners, prospective
partners, investors, prospective investors, professional advisors and lenders
who have a need to know the information and who agree to keep such 
information confidential or are otherwise bound to confidentiality or (ii) as
may be required in connection with the making of any filings that may be
required in connection with the Transactions under the HSR Act or Other
Competition Laws or as may  be required to respond to a request for documents
or information by any Governmental Antitrust Authority investigating the
Transactions, and (b) Parent's financing sources and other professional
advisors may publish "tombstones" or other customary  announcements which do
not contain pricing details that are not otherwise publicly available.

 

5.7 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, (i) Parent shall  not,
and shall not permit the Group Companies to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in any of their Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of
this Agreement relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses of any  present or former officers, managers and/or directors as of
immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_")
(unless and to the  extent required by Law) in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of DandO Indemnified Persons and (ii) Parent shall cause the
Group Companies to, to the fullest extent permitted by the Organizational
Documents as in effect on the date of  this Agreement, indemnify and hold
harmless the DandO Indemnified Persons against all Losses in respect of any
threatened, pending or completed claim, action or proceeding, whether
criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or  arising out of
or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of
any of the Group Companies arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase (and the 
Surviving Company shall maintain) in effect beginning on the Closing Date and
for a period of six (6) years thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a
"tail" policy providing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
for the benefit of  those Persons who are covered by any Group Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or
at the Closing with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing. The
cost of such directors' and officers' tail policy shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by the Company and fifty  percent (50%) by Parent. Such policy shall
provide coverage that is at least equal to the coverage provided under the
Group Companies' current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies; _provided_ that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof  so long as such
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries  or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all  of its properties and other assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7._

 

(d) In addition to the foregoing, during the pre-Closing period, the  Company
shall, at the request of Parent, use commercially reasonable efforts to
purchase, with effect beginning on the Closing Date, tail policies under the
Group Company's Insurance Policies with coverage and terms as determined by
Parent. The cost  of such tail policies shall be borne by Parent.

 

5.8 _R andW Insurance Policy_. The RandW Insurance Policy is bound by the Insurer
as of the date hereof. The RandW  Insurance Policy shall include an express
waiver and agreement not to pursue, directly or indirectly, by the Insurer,
any subrogation rights against any Equityholder, any Equityholder's
equityholders, any Group Company or any of its Affiliates or  any past,
present or future director, manager, officer, employee or advisor of any
Equityholder with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder, except
in the case of Actual Fraud. Parent and its Affiliates will not amend, waive
or  otherwise modify such subrogation provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy
in any manner adverse to such Persons.

 

5.9 _Exclusive Dealing_. Until the earlier of the time when this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ and  the Closing Date:

 

(a) The Company shall not take, nor shall it permit any of its  Affiliates
and any of its and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, or
other agents (" _Agents_ ") to take, any action to solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Parent,
Merger  Sub and/or their respective Affiliates) concerning any direct or
indirect purchase of any of the equity interests of the Group Companies or any
merger, sale of substantial assets (for the avoidance of doubt other than the
sale by any Group Company of  immaterial assets in the Ordinary Course of
Business) or similar transaction involving any Group Company (each such
acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition  Transaction_ ").

 

(b) Except as prohibited by confidentiality obligations entered into  prior
to the date hereof, the Company shall promptly advise Parent of any proposal
regarding an Acquisition Transaction and the terms and conditions of any such
proposal and the identity of the Person making any such proposal and shall
keep Parent  informed on a current basis in all material respects of the
status and details of any such proposal.

 

(c) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any  Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar Contract
to which any such party or any of its Affiliates is a party or under which any
such party or any of  its Affiliates has any rights, and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced at
the request of Parent.

 

(d) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the Company  and
its Affiliates shall, and shall cause their respective Agents to, immediately
cease discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
representatives,  consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, or
other agents) with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
terminate the access of any Persons other  than Parent and its Agents to any
"data room" hosted by the Company or any of its Affiliates or Agents relating
to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company agrees that the rights and
remedies of Parent for noncompliance with this _Section 5.9_ shall include the
right to specific enforcement of such provision, in compliance with _Section
10.9_ , it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach may cause irreparable injury to Parent and that money damages may not
provide an adequate remedy to Parent.

 

5.10 _Termination of Related Party Transactions_ ; _Assignment of Certain 
Related Agreements_. Except as set forth on _Section 5.10_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, prior to the Closing, the Company shall and  shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) to cancel, settle, extinguish
and terminate all Related Party Agreements, in each case without further
recourse to or any Liability or obligation on the part of a Group Company. In
addition,  the Company shall cause its Affiliates to assign certain previous
acquisition agreements to which the Member is currently a party and set forth
on _Section 5.10_   of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Management
Services Agreement, each in compliance with their terms, to the Company prior
to Closing.

 

5.11 _Resignations_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the written resignations of each director (or equivalent position) or
officer of a Group Company in their capacity as a director  (or equivalent
position) or officer of such Group Company that is designated by Parent to the
Representative in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, effective as of and conditioned upon the Closing.

 

5.12 _Release of Liens; Pay-off Letters_. The Company shall obtain, on or 
prior to the Closing, (a) an executed payoff letter with respect to each item
of Closing Date Indebtedness of the type set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) in
the definition of Indebtedness (the " _Funded Closing Indebtedness_ "), in
each case (i) setting forth the amount to be paid at Closing, together with
wire transfer instructions, (ii) evidencing the payment of such amount would 
result in the full repayment, satisfaction, release and discharge of all
obligations of the Group Companies in respect of such item and of all Liens
relating to such item and (iii) contemplating the delivery of UCC-3
termination statements and other  releases that when filed or recorded, as
the case may be, will be sufficient to release any and all Liens relating to
such item, if applicable, and (b) all UCC-3 termination statements and other
releases, if any, relating to assets, properties or  rights secured by such
Funded Closing Indebtedness, in each case in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent (collectively, the " _Payoff Documents_ ").

 

5.13 _Estoppels_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, or shall cause each
applicable Group Company to (a) request an estoppel certificate of each
landlord  of a Real Property Lease made pursuant to the provisions of the
applicable Real Property Lease as to such matters relating to the applicable
Real Property Lease as Parent shall reasonably request and (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain  such estoppel certificates;
_provided_ that no Group Company shall be required to pay any compensation or
other consideration to obtain such estoppel  certificates other than
immaterial processing fees or legal fees of counsel to landlords. For
avoidance of doubt, the receipt of such estoppel certificates shall not be a
condition to Closing.

 

5.14 _Section 280G Vote_. Before the Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain, with respect to each Person who
is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G  of the
Code) of a Group Company a waiver (subject to the approval in clause (b)) from
such Person of his or her right to receive or retain any payments of money or
other property, acceleration of benefits, or provision of other rights that
have been  or will be made hereunder, under any agreement contemplated
herein, or under any Benefit Plan, in each case, that are "contingent" (within
the meaning of Code Section 280G) on the consummation of the Transactions and
that would otherwise result in  the imposition of an excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code on such Person and (b) at least one (1) day after such
waivers have been obtained, to the extent obtained, use commercially
reasonable efforts to submit any such waived payments and  benefits for
approval in a manner that complies with the requirements under Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code and Treasury Regulations § 1.280G-1. The Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on
all  280G-related materials, including all waivers and approval materials in
advance of the delivery of such materials to the relevant Persons and the
Company shall consider Parent's comments thereon in good faith. This _Section
5.14_ shall not be construed to require any specific outcome of the vote
described herein and the failure to obtain any waiver referred to in this
_Section 5.14_ shall not be construed as a failure of any condition to
Closing.

 

5.15 _Financing Cooperation_. On and prior to the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause each other Group Company to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Group  Companies'
Agents to provide, in each case in a reasonably timely manner, reasonable
cooperation and assistance to Parent in connection with the arrangement of any
debt or equity financing for the Transactions, including, as reasonably
requested,  (i) assisting with due diligence activities of any debt or equity
financing sources relating to the financial information of the Group
Companies; (ii) making management of the Group Companies available to
participate in virtually-held due diligence  meetings, marketing sessions,
and sessions with rating agencies and debt and equity financing sources; (iii)
assisting with the preparation of any Offering Documents; (iv) promptly, and
in any event at least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date,  furnishing
all documentation and other information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
Laws, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended; and (v) providing
such  certificates, documents and financial and other information as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and its debt and equity financing sources,
including customary comfort letters from the Group Companies' independent
accountants; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require (A) such cooperation
to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Group  Companies or require travel by any Group Company officers or
employees; (B) the Group Companies to prepare or deliver any financial
statements or financial information not previously provided to Parent; or (C)
deliver or cause the delivery of any  legal opinions or any certificate as to
solvency. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall the Company, nor any other Group Company, be required to bear any
out-of-pocket cost or expense, pay any fee or incur any  Liability
(collectively, the " _Financing Liabilities_ ") or make, execute, deliver or
take any corporate actions to authorize any commitment, Contract, 
certificate or document prior to Closing in connection with any such debt or
equity financing. Parent shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the
Company for any Financing Liabilities incurred by the Group Companies and
their Affiliates in  performing the covenants contained in this _Section
5.15_ , except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Group  Companies or any of their Affiliates.

ARTICLE VII 
  
  
  TERMINATION

 

7.1 _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions may be  abandoned

    |  

by mutual written consent of Parent and the Representative;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(ii)

    |  

by either the Representative or Parent, if any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have  issued an Order prohibiting consummation
of the Transactions (after giving effect to Parent's and Merger Sub's

become final and nonappealable;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(iii)

    |  

by either the Representative or Parent, if the Closing does not occur on or
prior to December 15, 2020 (the  " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that
the  right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(a)(iii)_
shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of  this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the Termination Date;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(iv)

    |  

by the Representative, upon written notice to Parent, if there shall have been
a breach of any of the  representations, warranties, agreements or covenants
set forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or any of such
representations and warranties shall have become untrue in a manner that would
result in any conditions set  forth in _Sections_ _6.3(a)_ , _6.3(b)_ or
_6.3(c)_ not being satisfied, such  breach or inaccuracy has not been waived
by the Representative, and the breach or inaccuracy, if capable of being
cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) days following the
Representative's written notice to Parent of such breach or  inaccuracy or is
not capable of being cured on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement under  this _Section 7.1(a)(iv)_
shall not be available to the Representative if the Company is then in
material breach of any representation,  warranty, covenant, or other
agreement contained herein;

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(v)

    |  

by Parent, upon written notice to the Representative, if there shall have been
a breach of any of the  representations, warranties, agreements or covenants
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company or any of such
representations and warranties shall have become untrue in a manner that would
result in any conditions set forth in _Sections_ _6.2(a)_ , _6.2(b)_ or
_6.2(c)_ not being satisfied, such breach or inaccuracy has not  been waived
by Parent, and the breach or inaccuracy, if capable of being cured, has not
been cured within thirty (30) days following Parent's written notice to the
Representative of such breach or inaccuracy or is not capable of being cured 
on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(a)(v)_ shall not be available to Parent
if it is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
other agreement contained herein; or

    
---|--- 
    

 

        

(vi)

    |  

by the Representative, whether or not the Representative or the Company has
sought or is entitled to seek  specific performance pursuant to _Section
10.9_ , if (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections_ _6.1_ and _6.2_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing and those conditions that Parent's
breach has caused not to be satisfied) and (B) Parent fails to consummate the
Transactions within two (2) Business Days following the date on which the
Closing was required  to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

    
---|--- 
    

 

(b) In the event of termination by the Representative or Parent pursuant to
this _Section 7.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other and the Transactions shall be terminated, without further action by any
Party. If the Transactions are terminated as  provided herein, in the event
there is any pending dispute, controversy or claim between or among the
Parties arising out of or relating to the Transactions or to this Agreement
(or Parent believes such a dispute is reasonably possible),  Parent shall not
be obligated to return or destroy such documents and other materials as would
be required under the Confidentiality Agreement until the applicable dispute,
controversy or claim is no longer pending.

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Transactions are abandoned as described in _Section 7.1_ ,  this Agreement
shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, without any
Liability or obligation on the part of any Party or their respective
directors, managers, officers, employees, owners, representatives or
Affiliates, and the  Transactions shall be abandoned without further action
by the Parties, except for (i) the penultimate sentences of _Section 5.2(a)_
(Access to  Information) and _Section 5.15_ (Financing Cooperation), (ii)
_Sections  7.2_ (Effect of Termination), and _ARTICLE X_ (Miscellaneous),
each of which shall survive such termination. Nothing in this _Section 7.2_ ,
however, shall be deemed to release any Party from any Liability for Actual
Fraud or any willful breach by such Party of the terms and  provisions of
this Agreement prior to termination. For purposes of this _Sections 7.2_ ,
"willful breach" means a breach of, or failure to perform any of  the
covenants or other agreements contained in, a Transaction Agreement, in each
case, that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or
non-performing Party with actual knowledge, or knowledge that a Person acting
reasonably  under the circumstances should have known, that such Party's act
or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in or
constitute a breach of or failure of performance under a Transaction
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  
  TAX MATTERS

 

8.1 _Tax Matters; Cooperation_. The Representative shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed, with any out-of-pocket expenses
borne by the Representative, all income Tax Returns for  taxable periods of
the Group Companies ending on or prior to the Closing Date the due date of
which (taking into account valid, applicable extensions) is after the Closing
Date (the " _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_ ") and shall pay any Taxes shown
as due on any such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns (to the extent such Taxes
were not taken into account as a liability in Working Capital). The  Pre-
Closing Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice of the Group Companies unless a different treatment is otherwise
required by Law or permitted by changes in Law (including the amendments to
Section 172 of the  Code). The Representative shall provide a draft of each
such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return to Parent for its review and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared  and file or cause to be filed
all other Tax Returns for the Group Companies required to be filed after the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, the Representative and Parent shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (a) assist the other  in
preparing any Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and in connection
therewith provide the other necessary powers of attorney, (b) cooperate in
connection with any Tax Controversies with respect to any income Tax Returns
of the Group  Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (c) make available
to the other information, records, and documents reasonably necessary in
connection with Tax Controversies described in the foregoing clause (b) or
reasonably requested in connection with  the preparation of Tax Returns of
the Equityholders or the Group Companies. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Parent and the Representative shall retain (and shall cause their Affiliates
to retain) copies of all Tax Returns and related workpapers for  all taxable
periods that include the Closing Date and all prior taxable periods until the
expiration of the statute of limitations to which such Tax Returns relate.

 

8.2 _Tax Controversies_. Parent shall provide prompt written notice to the
Representative of, and shall not settle, compromise or otherwise resolve, any
Tax audits, Tax disputes or administrative, judicial or other  proceedings ("
_Tax Controversies_") related to any income Tax Return of any Group Company
for a tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that is  reasonably
expected to increase the Taxes payable by, or decrease the amount of any Tax
refund payable to, the Equityholders (or any equityholder of the Member)
without the prior written consent of the Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 

8.3 _Parent Tax Actions_. None of Parent, the Company or any Affiliate thereof
shall (or shall cause or permit any Group Company to) (a) amend, re-file or
otherwise modify any income Tax Return filed by any Group  Company with
respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) enter
into any closing agreement with respect any income Tax Return filed by any
Group Company with respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing  Date, or (c) make, change or revoke any material Tax election with
respect to the Company that has retroactive effect to any income Tax Return
filed by any Group Company with respect to a taxable period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, in each  case except to the extent (i) such action is
not reasonably expected to increase the Taxes payable by, or reduce the amount
of Tax refunds payable to, the Equityholders (or any equityholder of the
Member) or (ii) the Representative has granted prior  permission, which
permission shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

8.4 _Allocation of Taxes_. To the extent permissible under applicable Laws,
the Parties agree to elect (and have the Company and each Company Subsidiary
elect) to have each Tax year of the Company and each Company  Subsidiary to
end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not permitted or required in
a jurisdiction with respect to a specific Tax such that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period,
to  utilize the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date:
(a) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount  attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on  the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period; and (b) in the case of all other Taxes (including income
Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes, etc.), the amount 
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined as if the Company or Company Subsidiary filed a separate
Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and as  of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing
of the books methodology." For purposes of clause (b), (i) any item determined
on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation
deductions) shall be allocated to the  portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as compared to the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period; (ii) any Transaction  Deduction shall be
attributed to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; and (iii) any item (or Tax)
resulting from a Parent Closing Date Transaction shall be attributed to the 
portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 

8.5 _338(g) Elections_. Neither Parent nor any Group Company shall make an
election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the Transactions.

 

8.6 _Tax Refunds_. Parent shall, if the Representative so requests, reasonably
cooperate with the Representative in filing any amended returns and pursuing
the U.S. federal income Tax refund claims set forth on _Section 8.6_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The prosecution of any such claim for a Tax
refund shall be controlled by the Representative who shall  prepare any
required Tax Returns (including IRS Form 1139 or IRS Form 4466) in connection
therewith; provided, however, that any such Tax Returns shall not be filed
without the prior review and written consent of Parent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall pay over to the
Representative (for distribution to the Equityholders) the amount of any such
Tax refund (or credit in lieu of a Tax refund), along with any interest paid
or credited with  respect thereto, but net of any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs or expenses (including Taxes) that Parent or any of its Affiliates incur
(or will incur) in connection with the receipt of any such refund or credit
(but specifically excluding any Taxes  arising as a result of any reduction
in the amount of net operating losses that can be carried forward to tax
periods commencing after the Closing Date), no more than five (5) Business
Days after actual receipt of such Tax refund (or, in the case of  any Tax
credit, no more than five (5) Business Days after filing the applicable Tax
Return where such Tax credit is claimed). Neither Parent, any of the Group
Companies nor any of their Affiliates shall elect under Section 172(b)(3) of
the Code (or  any similar provision of state, local or foreign applicable
Law) to waive any carryback of net operating losses of any Group Company that
are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

8.7 _Other Tax Matters_. For Tax purposes, the Parties shall treat the Member
as transferring its Interest to the corporation that owns Parent (of which
Parent is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes)and  the Company,
Centauri Holdings Parent, LLC and Centauri Equity Holdings, LLC shall become
members of the affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the
Code) that includes the corporation that owns Parent and become part of a 
consolidated federal income tax return that includes such corporation for the
period commencing on the day after the Closing Date. The Parties shall also
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the Company
for income Tax  purposes and, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
shall (a) treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of each
Company Subsidiary for income Tax purposes and (b) subject to Parent's rights
with respect to Pre-Closing Income  Tax Returns under _Section 8.1_ , to the
extent such Transaction Deductions are "more likely than not deductible" (or
deductible at a higher confidence  level) by a Group Company under applicable
Law in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, treat all Transaction
Deductions as attributable to taxable periods of a Group Company ending on the
Closing Date. Neither Parent, any Group Company nor  any Affiliate thereof
shall claim any Transaction Deduction on any Tax Return for any income tax
period commencing after the Closing Date that were claimed on a Tax Return for
any income tax period ending on or before the Closing Date; provided that, 
for avoidance of doubt, neither Parent, any Group Company nor any Affiliate
thereof shall be prohibited from claiming any net operating losses that carry
forward from any income tax period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

ARTICLE IX 
  
  
  INDEMNIFICATION

 

9.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company, the
Equityholders, the Representative, Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered in connection with this  Agreement
shall not survive the Closing. Each of the representations and warranties of
the Company, the Equityholders, the Representative, Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered in connection with
this  Agreement shall terminate effective immediately as of the Closing such
that no claim for breach of any such representation or warranty may be brought
after the Closing with respect thereto against the Company, the Equityholders,
the Representative,  Parent and Merger Sub. The covenants and agreements of
the Company, the Equityholders, the Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement to the extent contemplating or requiring performance prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing until the  six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ ") and thus claims may be brought in
respect of a breach thereof, until the  Expiration Date. Each covenant and
agreement herein requiring performance at or after the Closing, shall, in each
case, expressly survive the Closing, and nothing in this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be
deemed to limit any rights or remedies of any Party for breach of any such
surviving covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written
claim or written notice is given  under this _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to
breach of any covenant or agreement contemplating or requiring performance
prior to the Closing, prior to the  Expiration Date, the claim with respect
to such covenant or agreement shall continue indefinitely until such claim is
finally resolved pursuant to this _ARTICLE  IX_. Nothing in this _ARTICLE IX_
other than  _Section 9.3_ shall (i) limit Parent's remedies in the event of
Actual Fraud, provided that recovery shall be limited solely against the
Person which  committed such Actual Fraud; or (ii) limit or waive any rights
of Parent or any other additional insured pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy
or any excess  policy relating thereto.

 

9.2 _Indemnification._

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_ , the
Representative, not in its individual capacity but only on behalf of the
Equityholders, shall indemnify Parent and its officers, directors,
employees,  agents and its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) (each,
a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse the Parent
Indemnitees  for, all Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Parent
Indemnitees to the extent arising out of or resulting from any breach of or
non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement contemplating or requiring
performance prior to the Closing, made by  the Company in this Agreement
(collectively, " _Parent Losses_ ").

 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_ , Parent shall
indemnify each Equityholder, and if applicable, each of its officers,
directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (each, a " _Equityholder
Indemnitee_ ") from and against, and shall reimburse the Equityholder
Indemnitees for, all Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Equityholder
Indemnitees to  the extent arising out of or resulting from any breach of or
non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement contemplating or requiring
performance prior to the Closing made by Parent in this Agreement
(collectively, " _Equityholder Losses_ " and together with Parent Losses, "
_Covered Losses_ ").

 

9.3 _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

 

(a) (i) the Representative's obligation, on behalf of the  Equityholders, to
indemnify the Parent Indemnitees against any Parent Losses after the Closing
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ and (ii) the Equityholders  obligation to
indemnify the Parent Indemnitees for Actual Fraud in connection with the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement (provided
that recovery by the Parent Indemnitees shall be limited to the Person who
committed  such Actual Fraud) shall not exceed, collectively in the
aggregate, the amount set forth on _Section 9.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Cap_ ").

 

(b) Parent's obligation to indemnify the Equityholder Indemnitees  against
any Equityholder Losses after Closing shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the
Cap.

 

(c) No Equityholder shall be liable in the aggregate under this  Agreement
for more than the portion of the Merger Consideration actually received by
such Equityholder with respect to Actual Fraud in connection with the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement.

 

(d) To the extent that the retention under the RandW  Insurance Policy has been
exhausted, Parent or any additional insured under the RandW Insurance Policy
shall first seek recovery under and exhaust the RandW Insurance Policy before
seeking recovery from any Equityholder or the Representative  hereunder;
provided, however, Parent or any Parent Indemnitee may deliver a Notice of
Claim in order to preserve a claim for recovery.

 

(e) If any Indemnified Party collects an amount in  discharge of a claim in
respect of a Loss reimbursed by an Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified
Party and/or an Affiliate thereof (where the Surviving Company is the
Indemnified Party) subsequently recovers from a third party (including under
the  RandW Insurance Policy) (such excess recovery, the " _Excess Recovery_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall (or, as appropriate, shall cause such Affiliate 
to) repay to the Indemnifying Party or Parties an amount equal to the Excess
Recovery less any costs or expenses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified
Party in procuring the Excess Recovery including any related insurance premium
(but no more than  the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ ).

 

(f) Any Losses for which any Indemnified Party is  entitled to
indemnification under this _ARTICLE IX_ shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to  such
Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 

(g) The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to  indemnification under
this _ARTICLE IX_ with respect to any amount resulting in a claim to the
extent that such amount is reflected in the calculation  of Final Closing
Date Merger Consideration.

 

(h) For purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ , "Losses" shall specifically exclude __
punitive and exemplary damages  except as incurred in connection with a Third
Party Claim.

 

9.4 _Notice of Claims_. If any Parent Indemnitee or Equityholder Indemnitee
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") believes that  it has suffered or incurred, any
Covered Loss for which it is entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE
IX_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly  notify the party from whom
indemnification is being claimed (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). This notice
(" _Notice of Claim_ ") shall specify the basis of the claim in reasonable
detail in light of the circumstances then known by the Indemnified Party. If
any Legal Proceeding is instituted by or  against a third party with respect
to which any Indemnified Party intends to claim any Covered Losses, such
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such Legal
Proceeding. The failure to provide any notice in accordance with this _Section
9.4_ shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _ARTICLE IX_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

9.5 _Claims by Parties_.

 

(a) Other than third-party claims, which are covered by _Section 9.6_ , within
twenty (20) days after delivery of any Notice of Claim delivered in accordance
with _Section 9.4_ , the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified
Party a written response (the " _Response_ ")  in which the Indemnifying
Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all
of the asserted amount of Covered Losses (the " _Asserted  Damages Amount_
"), in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment to the
Indemnified Party of such amount, by check or by wire transfer; (ii) agree
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of  the
Asserted Damages Amount (such portion, the " _Agreed Portion_ "), in which
case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment to the Indemnified Party 
of the Agreed Portion, by check or by wire transfer; or (iii) dispute that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Asserted Damages Amount
and provide in reasonable detail the basis therefor.

 

(b) In the event that the party providing a Response pursuant to _Section
9.5(a)_ shall (i) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
any of the Asserted Damages Amount, or (ii) agree that the Indemnified  Party
is entitled only to the Agreed Portion of the Asserted Damages Amount, the
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties with respect to each of the Indemnification Claims
that comprise  the Asserted Damages Amount (or the portion of the Asserted
Damages Amount not comprising the Agreed Portion). If the Representative and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both such  Parties. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation within sixty (60) days after delivery of
a Response, either the Representative or Parent may seek resolution in
accordance with _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_.

 

9.6 _Third Party Claims_. If any third party notifies any Indemnified Party
with respect to any matter which the Indemnified Party determines may give
rise to a claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying  Party under
this _ARTICLE IX_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),  then the Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof as promptly as practicable and in
any event within thirty (30) days after receiving any written notice from a
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided  hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Once the Indemnified Party has given notice of the matter to the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party may defend against the  matter so
long as (a) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing,
within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim, that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from  and against any Covered Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, or arising out of, such Third Party Claim (subject to the
Cap), and (b) the Indemnifying Party possesses financial resources that would
reasonably be expected to be  sufficient to defend against the Third Party
Claim and to fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder; _provided_ ,
that if the Indemnifying Party  is the Representative, such Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to defend any such matter (i) that seeks to
impose criminal liability on an Indemnified Party, (ii) if the Indemnifying
Party has failed or is failing to actively and diligently  defend in good
faith such matter, and is provided written notice of such failure by the
Indemnified Party and such failure is not reasonably cured within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of such notice; (iii) that is reasonably likely to
involve  Covered Losses in an amount in excess of the Cap; (iv) if such Third
Party Claim includes a claim to obtain an injunction, restraining order,
declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief or (v) if the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel  there exists any actual or potential
conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim that would make
representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by  the
Indemnifying Party inappropriate. In the event the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after the date the Indemnified
Party has given notice of the matter that the Indemnifying Party is assuming
the defense of  such matter (A) the Indemnifying Party shall defend the
Indemnified Party against the matter with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate counsel at its sole cost and  expense and (C) the Indemnifying Party
shall not consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to the matter or
enter into any settlement which does not include a provision whereby the
plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified  Party from all
liability with respect thereto, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Insurer, to
the extent required under the RandW Insurance Policy. If the Indemnifying 
Party elects not to, or is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement to,
assume the defense of and indemnification for such matter, then the
Indemnified Party shall proceed diligently to defend such matter; _provided_ ,
that the Indemnified Party shall not settle, adjust or compromise such matter,
or admit any liability with respect to such matter, without the prior written
consent of  the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The procedures in this _Section 9.6_ shall not apply
to  direct claims of Equityholder Indemnitees or Parent Indemnitees governed
by _Section 9.5_.

 

9.7 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, any amounts determined in accordance with, and payable under, this
_ARTICLE IX_ shall be treated by Parent and the Representative as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

9.8 _Release_. Parent, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries),
acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the Representative's 
indemnification obligations (on behalf of the Equityholders) under this
_Article IX_ and claims for Actual Fraud, from and after the Closing, to the 
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against any Equityholder or its Affiliates or any
of the former, current, or future general or limited partners, shareholders or
equityholders,  managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents or any former, current or future general or limited
partner, direct or indirect shareholder or equityholder, manager, member,
director, officer, employee, Affiliate,  representative or agent of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Equityholder Related Persons_ ") relating
to the operation of the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or Exhibits hereto or the Transactions,
whether arising under, or based upon, any Law or otherwise (including  any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification,
contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy,
including as may arise under common law) are hereby irrevocably waived.
Furthermore, without limiting the  generality of this _Section 9.8_ , subject
to the Representative's indemnification obligations (on behalf of the
Equityholders) under this _Article IX_ and claims for Actual Fraud, no claim
shall be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the  Closing, the Surviving Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) against any Equityholder Related Person, and no recourse
shall be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon,
any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or  breach of, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company, the
Equityholders or any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement,
any certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or other document of the 
Company, the Equityholders or any other Person delivered hereunder, the
subject matter of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Exhibits hereto or the Transactions, the business or the ownership, operation,
management, use or control  of the business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior
to, the Closing. Nothing in this _Section 9.8_ shall (i) limit Parent's
remedies in the event of  Actual Fraud except as set forth in _Section 9.3_ ;
or (ii) limit or waive any rights of Parent or any other additional insured
pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy or any excess policy relating thereto.

 

9.9 _Indemnification Rights Remedies Exclusive._ Except with respect to Actual
Fraud (except as set forth in _Section 9.3_ ),  the rights of the Indemnified
Parties to indemnification relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
shall be strictly limited to those contained in this _ARTICLE  IX_ , and,
subject to _ARTICLE VIII_ and _Section  10.9_ , such indemnification rights
shall be the exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties subsequent to the
Effective Time with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or arising in connection herewith.

 

9.10 _Parent Acknowledgement_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this _ARTICLE IX_ are  an integral part of the
Transactions and that, without these agreements set forth in this _ARTICLE IX_
, the Company and the Equityholders would not  enter into this Agreement or
otherwise agree to consummate the Transaction.

 


 

 

ARTICLE X 
  
  
  MISCELLANEOUS

 

10.1 _Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other  Transaction
Agreements, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated  hereby or thereby and the consummation of the Transactions.
Each of Parent and the Company shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
(i) all governmental filing fees and governmental charges applicable to any
requests for Governmental Approvals  or to the consummation of the
Transactions and (ii) any charges and expenses of the Escrow Agent in
connection with this Agreement. The Company shall be solely responsible for
any fees and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with this  Agreement.

 

(b) Any sales, use, real estate transfer, stock transfer or similar  transfer
Tax (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") payable in connection with the Transactions shall
be borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the 
Equityholders. Except as otherwise required by Law, Parent shall duly and
timely prepare and file any Tax Return relating to such Taxes and shall not
file any such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which shall not  be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to reduce any applicable
Transfer Taxes and in preparing and filing all applicable Tax Returns with
respect to any such Taxes.

 

10.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made
and performed in such state without giving effect to the  choice of law
principles of such state that would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

10.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Subject to _Section 1.10(d)(ii)_
(which will govern any dispute arising  thereunder), the Parties agree that
any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the
Transactions or to this Agreement, or the validity, interpretation, breach or
termination thereof, including claims seeking redress or asserting  rights
under any Law, shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts
sitting in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ "). In that 
context, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(a) submits for itself and its property in any action relating to the 
Transactions or to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Courts, and appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the
foregoing courts, and  agrees that all claims in respect of any such action
shall be heard and determined in such Delaware Courts or, to the extent
permitted by Law, in such appellate courts;

 

(b) consents that any such action may and shall be brought exclusively  in
such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue or jurisdiction of any such action in any such court or that such action
was brought in an inconvenient forum, and agrees not to plead or claim the
same;

 

(c) waives all right to trial by jury in any action (whether based on 
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the Transactions or
to this Agreement, or its performance under or the enforcement of this
Agreement;

 

(d) agrees that service of process in any such action may be effected  by
mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Party at its
address as provided in _Section 10.7_; and

 

(e) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to  effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

 

10.4 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, each Party shall from time to
time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other,
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and  assumption and
take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more
effectively consummate the Transactions.

 

10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto), the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the other Transaction
Agreements represent the entire understanding and agreement  between the
Parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes all prior agreements
among the Parties respecting the Transactions. The Parties have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the 
Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and except with respect to Actual Fraud, the
Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to
any remedies not expressly  set forth in this Agreement, the documents
delivered pursuant hereto or the other Transaction Agreements.

 

10.6 _Amendments and Waivers_. Prior to Closing, this Agreement can be
amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only
by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement  signed by
Parent and the Company; provided that after the Required Member Consent is
executed and delivered by the signatories thereto, there shall be no amendment
or waiver that, pursuant to applicable law, requires further approval of the
Member  without the receipt of such approval. Following Closing, this
Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof
can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by Parent and the  Representative. The waiver by any Party
of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any  Party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further
exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In the
event any provision of any other Transaction Agreement shall in any way
conflict with the provisions of this Agreement (except where a provision
therein expressly provides that it is  intended to take precedence over this
Agreement), this Agreement shall control.

 

10.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand, (b) when sent by facsimile or e-mail (with written  confirmation of
receipt), or (c) one Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier
(charges prepaid), in each case at the following addresses and facsimile
numbers (or to such other address or facsimile number as a Party may have
specified  by notice given to the other Parties pursuant to this provision).

10.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall  nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal,  or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions is consummated as  originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

10.9 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be 
irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this
Agreement by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by  monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition
to any other right or remedy to which any Party may be entitled at law or in
equity, before or after the Closing, each Party shall be entitled to seek to
enforce any provision of this Agreement by a  decree of specific performance
and to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
without posting any bond or other undertaking. Each of the  Parties further
agrees that it shall not object to, or take any position inconsistent with
respect to, whether in a court of law or otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of
the specific performance contemplated by this _Section 10.9_ and (ii) the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts set forth in _Section 10.3_   with
respect to any action brought for any such remedy.

 

(b) Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided  for
in this _Section 10.9_ , a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under  this
Agreement, or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
10.9_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing  set
forth in this _Section 10.9_ shall require any Party to institute any action
for (or limit any Party's right to institute any action for) specific 
performance under this _Section 10.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _ARTICLE VII_ , nor shall the commencement of any
action pursuant to this _Section 10.9_ or  anything set forth in this
_Section 10.9_ restrict or limit any such Party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ , or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

10.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to give any rights to any Person or
entity other than (i) the Parties and their successors and  permitted
assigns, and (ii) each DandO Indemnified Person, who shall have the right to
enforce the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company solely with
respect to _Section 5.7_.

 

10.11 _Assignment_. No Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or any
right, interest or obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly (by operation
of Law or otherwise), without the prior written approval of  Parent, on the
one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders), on the
other hand; _provided_ , that each of Parent and Merger Sub may  assign its
rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement without the prior
approval of the Representative to (a) any of its Affiliates, (b) any financing
sources for collateral purposes, and (c) after the Closing, any Person to
which Parent  sells all or substantially all of the assets relating to the
business of any Group Company; _provided_ , _further_ that any such assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any
assignment in violation of this _Section 10.11_ shall be null and void and of
no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors  and
permitted assigns.

 

10.12 _Authorization of Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of adoption of this Agreement by the Equityholders and  the
terms of the CHP Equity Incentive Plan, and without further action by any such
Equityholder, the Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered
to act as an agent, representative and attorney-in-fact for each of the
Equityholders in  connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the
Transactions, including pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement, and the matters related to (w) the adjustment of the Merger
Consideration contemplated by _Section 1.10_ , (x) the payment of amounts from
the Representative Expense Fund Amount, including the payment of any Taxes,
and payment related to the  Representative's indemnification obligations
under _ARTICLE IX_ , (y) the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns with
respect to the Group Companies  contemplated by _ARTICLE VIII_ and (z) all
other such items and matters set forth in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements contemplating  participation by the Representative
(collectively, " _Representative Actions_ "), in each case with the power and
authority, including power of  substitution (subject to the approval of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
acting in the name of or for and on behalf of each Equityholder, and subject
to the limitations set forth herein or therein: (i) to  execute and deliver
and receive such waivers and consents as the Representative, in its sole
discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (ii) to collect and receive all
moneys and other proceeds and property payable to the Representative from
the  Representative Expense Fund Amount, and, subject to any applicable
withholding Laws, and net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Representative, disburse and pay the same to each Equityholder in accordance
with such Equityholder's Pro Rata  Share; (iii) to consent to, compromise and
settle claims for indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ , to authorize the
release of any funds from the  Adjustment Escrow Account in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; (iv) to authorize the release of any
funds by the Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement; (v) to enforce and protect the  rights and interests of the
Equityholders and the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to any Representative Action, and to take any and all actions which

conducting negotiations with Parent, Merger Sub, the Group Companies (after
the Closing) and their representatives regarding such Claims; (vi) to refrain
from  enforcing any right of any Equityholder and/or the Representative
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to any Representative Action
in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , that no such failure to act on
the part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative
or by the  Equityholders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the
waiving party or by the Representative; (vii) to make, execute, acknowledge,
deliver and receive all such other agreements, guarantees, Orders, receipts,
endorsements, notices, requests,  instructions, certificates, stock powers,
letters and other writings and service of process in connection with any
Claims, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute  discretion, may
consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out
the Representative Actions, and all other agreements, documents or instruments
executed in connection therewith; and (viii) take all such other actions as 
the Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate, in its discretion, for
the accomplishment of the foregoing and the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) The Representative shall be entitled to the payment of all its  out-of-
pocket expenses incurred as the Representative by or on behalf of the
Equityholders subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including _Section 1.9(c)_ , which such amounts to be
used by the Representative to pay expenses incurred by the Representative in

not consummated, the Company shall reimburse the Representative for all costs
and expenses reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with 
the Transactions and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any Liability to
the Representative or the Company in connection therefor. Once the
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that the Representative
will not incur any additional  expenses in its capacity as the
Representative, then the Representative will distribute the remaining unused
Representative Expense Fund Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the Member and CHP Members) and the Surviving  Company (for
further distribution to the Optionholders) based on the Equityholders'
applicable Pro Rata Share. If, however, the Representative incurs expenses, in
its capacity as the Representative, in an amount exceeding the Representative
Expense  Fund Amount, then the Representative shall be entitled to receive
from the Equityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares an amount for
the difference between the total expenses incurred by the Representative and
the Representative Expense  Fund Amount. Furthermore, the Representative
shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to withhold and pay a portion of
any Other Equityholder Payments to the Representative, by providing written
notice thereof to the Paying Agent and Parent prior  to its distribution of
such Other Equityholder Payment, for the purpose of the Representative making
any payments or paying any expenses under or in connection with this Agreement
on behalf of the Equityholders to satisfy costs, expenses and/or  liabilities
of the Representative in connection with the performance of its duties under
this Agreement. In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument,
agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing
to exercise  all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder, (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any of the Equityholders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted  hereunder or any such other agreement,
instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act or failure
to act which represents willful misconduct, (ii) the Representative shall not
be liable to Equityholders for any apportionment or  distribution of payments
made by the Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole
recourse of any Equityholder to whom payment was due, but not made or not 
made in full, shall be to recover from the other Equityholders any payment in
excess of the amount to which such Equityholder is determined to have been
entitled, and (iii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice
of counsel, public  accountants or other independent experts experienced in
the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the
Representative to liability to any of the  Equityholders. Each Equityholder
shall indemnify, on a pro rata basis (based on such Equityholder's Pro Rata
Share), the Representative against all Losses (including any and all expense
whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or  defending
against any Legal Proceeding, commenced or threatened or any claims
whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation,
challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts  or omissions of the Representative hereunder. The
foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or
proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative
hereunder for its willful misconduct.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the 
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to rely upon all actions and communications taken or
omitted to be  taken by the Representative, including Representative Actions,
and shall have no obligation to inquire of the Equityholders with respect
thereto, all of which actions or omissions, including Representative Actions,
shall be conclusive and legally  binding upon the Equityholders as fully as
if such Equityholder had taken such actions or made such omissions and no
Equityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The grant of authority provided  for herein (i)
is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survives the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any of the Equityholders, and (ii)
shall survive the Closing. The provisions of this _Section 10.12_ are
independent and severable, shall constitute an irrevocable power of attorney,
coupled with an interest and surviving death or dissolutions, granted by the 
Equityholders to the Representative, and shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each such
Equityholder. Any amounts received by the Representative on account of the
Equityholders, whether pursuant  to _Section 1.9_ or otherwise, shall be
distributed to the Equityholders, net of any reserve the Representative may
deem necessary in its reasonable  discretion, in accordance with _Section
1.11_.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Representative shall  have no
liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any Party in
connection with any obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(e) The Representative, in its capacity as such, represents and  warrants
that it has full power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Agreements applicable to the Representative and to consummate the
Transactions. This  Agreement and each of the other Transaction Agreements to
which the Representative is a party constitutes, or will constitute as of the
Closing Date, a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Representative
(solely as agent, representative and  attorney-in-fact of the Equityholders
and not in its individual capacity) enforceable against it in accordance with
its and their respective terms, subject to the Equitable Principles.

 

(f) In the event of the death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or 
resignation of any Person serving as the Representative, as applicable, within
twenty (20) days of such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or
resignation, the Member shall choose the successor representative. Following
such resignation, any  reference to the Representative herein shall be deemed
to include such successor representative.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 10.12_ , the
provisions of this _Section 10.12_ do  not affect any right of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Company hereunder or create any obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company. The Equityholders shall bear full
responsibility for any and all obligations arising  pursuant to this _Section
10.12_.

 

10.13 _Attorney Conflict Waiver_. Recognizing that the Law Firms have acted as
legal counsel to the Representative and its Affiliates and the Group Companies
prior to the Closing, and that the Law Firms intend to act  as legal counsel
to the Representative and its Affiliates (which will no longer include the
Group Companies) after the Closing, each of  Parent and the Company hereby
waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with the Law Firms representing the
Representative and/or its Affiliates (including any of the  Equityholders)
after the Closing as such representation may relate to the Transactions. In
addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between the
Representative, its Affiliates or any Group Company and the Law Firms in the 
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions,
to the extent relating to the Transactions, shall be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to the Representative and its Affiliates
(and not the  Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not
have access to any such communications, or to the files of the Law Firms
relating to its engagement in respect to such communications, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Representative and its
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none  of the
Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
the Law Firms in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client,
only the Representative and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall
hold such  property rights and (iii) the Law Firms shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between the Law Firms and any of  the Group Companies or
otherwise to the extent relating to the Transactions.

 

10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission
(including e-mail), each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of 
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. Such delivery of counterparts shall be
conclusive evidence of the intent to be bound hereby and to the extent
applicable, the foregoing  constitutes the election of the Parties to invoke
any Law authorizing electronic signatures.

11.2 _Certain Interpretive Matters_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for
purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

 

(a) _Time of the Essence; Calculation of Time Periods_. Time is of the essence
for each and every provision of this Agreement. When calculating the period of
time before which, within which or following which any  act is to be done or
step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next  succeeding
Business Day.

 

(b) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to "$" or dollars shall mean
U.S. dollars.

 

(c) _Exhibits/Schedules/Construction_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are an integral part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated
herein and made a part hereof as if set forth herein. Any  capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be
defined as set forth in this Agreement. Any disclosure set forth in one
section of the Schedules shall apply to (i) the representations and warranties
or  covenants contained in the Section of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number, (ii) any representation and warranty or covenant to
which it is referred by cross reference, and (iii) any other representation or
warranty or covenant to the  extent it is reasonably apparent from the
wording of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such
representation or warranty or covenant. The inclusion of any information in
the Schedules shall not constitute, or be deemed to  constitute, an admission
to any third party concerning such information, including information relating
to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law. Capitalized terms
used in the Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the  meanings
given to them in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 

(e) _Headings_. The provision of the Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall  not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Article," "Section" or other subdivision are to the
corresponding Article, Section or other subdivision of this Agreement unless 
otherwise specified.

 

(f) _Herein_. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," "hereunder"
and "hereto" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise 
requires.

 

(g) _Including_. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or 
matters immediately following it.

 

(h) _Made Available_. An item shall be considered "made available" to a Party
hereto, to the extent such phrase appears in this Agreement, only if such item
has been posted by the Company or its representatives in  the Data Room and
available to the Party on the date that is at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the date of this Agreement and remained accessible to such Party
through the Closing Date.

 

(i) _Reflected On or Set Forth In_. An item arising with respect to a specific
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth
in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the  extent any such phrase
appears in such representation or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual
or other similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial
statements that specifically addresses the subject matter of such 
representation at issue, (ii) such item is otherwise specifically set forth on
the balance sheet or financial statements, or (iii) such item is reflected on
the balance sheet or financial statements and is specifically set forth in the
notes thereto.

 

(j) _Material_. As used in this Agreement, unless the context would require
otherwise, the term "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an
effect upon the Group Companies or their business shall be  measured relative
to the Group Companies as their business is currently being conducted. There
have been included in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not 
"material" within the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence and in
order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to
be an agreement by the Parties that such items are "material" or to further
define the meaning  of such term for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(k) _Joint Negotiation and Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this  Agreement shall be
construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
