instead receive Pensare Securities of the same type as the PIPE Securities
issued to investors in the Private Placement and in the same proportion of
PIPE Securities (if more than one class or type of PIPE Security is issued in
the Private Placement) issued to investors in the Private Placement and (ii)
the Stock Consideration shall be defined as such amount of PIPE Securities as
shall equal the Stockholder Share Consideration Amount divided by the
applicable price per unit paid by investors for the applicable PIPE Securities
in the Private Placement (with appropriate adjustments being made to the
requirements under _Section 3.02_ to reflect such change);

  



  

(b)  all shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to

on the Payment Spreadsheet, and (ii) if any Company Transaction Expenses are
to be paid in shares of Pensare Common Stock, issue at the Closing to the
intended recipients the number of shares of Pensare Common Stock set forth on

the Company Transaction Expenses to be paid in shares, _divided by_ the Price
Per Share, with the number of shares issuable to each recipient as set forth
on the Payment Spreadsheet and with fractional shares rounded down or rounded
up, as the case may be, to the nearest whole share); _provided_ ,  _that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Company Transaction Expenses are to be
paid in shares of Pensare Common Stock in accordance with this _Section
3.01(f)(ii)_ and if the PIPE Securities shall consist of anything other than
solely Pensare Common Stock, (i) the recipients of Company Transaction
Expenses otherwise entitled to receive shares of Pensare Common
Stock hereunder shall instead receive Pensare Securities of the same type as
the PIPE Securities issued to investors in the Private Placement and in the
same proportion of PIPE Securities (if more than one class or type of PIPE
Security is issued in the Private Placement) issued to investors in the
Private Placement and (ii) the number of shares of Pensare Securities to be
issued to such recipients of Company Transaction Expenses shall be determined

by the applicable price per unit paid by investors for the applicable PIPE
Securities in the Private Placement.

    



  

(g)  On the Closing Date, Pensare shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Company, for further payment to the MRP Participants, (i)
the MRP Cash Consideration Amount and (ii) an aggregate number of shares of
Pensare Common Stock equal to the MRP Share Consideration Amount _divided by_
the Price Per Share, with such cash and stock to be allocated among the MRP
Participants as set forth on the Payment Spreadsheet, and with fractional
shares rounded down or rounded up, as the case may be, to the nearest whole
share; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, if the PIPE
Securities shall consist of anything other than solely Pensare Common Stock,
(i) the MRP Participants entitled to receive shares of Pensare Common Stock in
accordance with  _Section 3.01(g)(ii)_ shall instead receive Pensare
Securities of the same type as the PIPE Securities issued to investors in the
Private Placement and in the same proportion of PIPE Securities (if more than
one class or type of PIPE Securities is issued in the Private Placement)
issued to investors in the Private Placement and (ii) the number of shares of
Pensare Securities to be issued to such MRP Participants shall be determined
by dividing the MRP Share Consideration Amount by the applicable price
per unit paid by investors for the applicable PIPE Securities in the Private
Placement.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if immediately
after receipt of the shares of Pensare Common Stock issuable to the
Investcorp Investors pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ and the consummation of the
Private Placement, the Pensare Stockholder Redemptions and the other
Transactions, the Investcorp Investors would own 10% or more of the
outstanding Pensare Common Stock, then Pensare and IVC shall negotiate in
good faith to determine if there is a security of equivalent value that can be
provided to one or more of the Investcorp Investors, in lieu of a certain
number of shares of Pensare Common Stock, such that the aggregate ownership
by the Investcorp Investors of Pensare Common Stock is just less than 10%.

  



  

Section 3.02   _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, Pensare shall deposit,
and shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be
designated by Pensare and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ and an agreement to be
entered between Pensare and the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent

Stockholder Cash Consideration Amount payable pursuant to this Agreement (less
the portion of the Stockholder Cash Consideration Amount owed to the Direct
Wire Recipients hereunder) and (ii) certificates representing the number of
shares of Pensare Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement as of the Effective Time
(less the Stock Consideration issuable to Direct Wire Recipients) (such
certificates for shares of Pensare Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto (pursuant to _Section 3.02(d)_ ), and
such cash, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pensare
shall cause the Exchange Agent pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay
the Stockholder Cash Consideration Amount (less the portion of the Stockholder
Cash Consideration Amount owed to the Direct Wire Recipients hereunder) and
deliver the Stock Consideration (less the Stock Consideration issuable to the
Direct Wire Recipients) out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.02(g)_ hereof, the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(b)   _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Pensare shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_: a letter of transmittal,
which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Pensare and the Company (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and shall specify (i) that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent; and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of
Transmittal. Within 5 Business Days after the surrender to the Exchange Agent
of all Certificates held by such holder for cancellation, together with a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Pensare shall cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver, the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 3.01_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each
Certificate entitled to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.01_ shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

(c)   _Direct Wire Recipients_. On the Closing Date, Pensare shall
deliver or issue (or cause to be delivered or issued) to each Direct Wire
Recipient that surrenders to Pensare at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date all Certificates held by such Direct Wire Recipient for
cancellation, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may be customarily required pursuant to such instructions, (i)
the portion of the Stockholder Cash Consideration Amount opposite such Direct
Wire Recipient's name on the Payment Spreadsheet by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by such
Direct Wire Recipient on the Payment Spreadsheet, and (ii) the number of
shares of Pensare Common Stock opposite such Direct Wire Recipient's name on
the Payment Spreadsheet.

  



  

(d)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Pensare
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Pensare Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Pensare Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax
or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, Pensare
shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the certificates representing
shares of Pensare Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Pensare Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable
with respect to such shares of Pensare Common Stock.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(e)   _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock.

    



  

(f)   _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Stock Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Pensare Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(g)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Pensare, upon demand, and any
Company Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to Pensare for the Merger Consideration. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Company Stockholders as
of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Pensare free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(h)   _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Pensare or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Company Stockholder for any such
Company Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law in accordance with _Section 3.02(g)_.

  



  

(i)   _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Pensare shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or Pensare, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Stock (or intended recipients of compensatory payments) in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Pensare, as the case may be.

  



  

(j)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration that such holder is otherwise entitled to receive
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of _Section 3.01._

  



  

Section 3.03   _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or
Pensare for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with, the provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

Section 3.04   _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
and to the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the
exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such stockholders shall have no
right to receive, the Merger Consideration unless and until such
Company Stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her
or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Any Company
Stockholders who fails to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise
losses their rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02(b)_, of the Certificate
or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Company Stock.

  



  

(b)  Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give Pensare (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any
withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Pensare
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

  



  

Section 3.05   _Net Debt._

  



  

(a)  At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Pensare (i) a good faith estimate in reasonable
detail of the Net Debt of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "
_Actual Net Debt Amount_ ") and (ii) the Payment Spreadsheet.

  



  

(b)  At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Pensare shall deliver to the Company a certificate (the " _Pensare Closing
Cash Certificate_ ") reflecting: (A) (i) the amount of cash available in the
Trust Account as of the Closing and (ii) the amount of cash necessary to pay
income and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust
Account at the Closing, (iii) the amount of cash necessary to pay any costs
and expenses owed by Pensare in accordance with _Section 9.03_  that are
unpaid at the Closing; and (B) the aggregate amount of cash proceeds that will
be required to satisfy the Pensare Stockholder Redemptions.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(c)  At least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Pensare a calculation of the Deleveraging Amount and
shall identify the portion of the Deleveraging Amount that will be used to pay
down indebtedness outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement at or
immediately after the Effective Time and the portion (if any) of the
Deleveraging Amount that will be contributed by Pensare to Telepacific OpCo
to be held as cash on the balance sheet of Telepacific OpCo.

  



  

(d)  Subject to _Section 7.15(d)_ , Pensare shall repay indebtedness
of, and contribute cash to, Telepacific OpCo on the Closing Date in an amount
equal to, in aggregate, the Deleveraging Amount in accordance with _Section
3.05(c)_ and _Section 7.15_. If requested by Pensare, the Company shall
cooperate in the payment of such indebtedness pursuant to this
_Section 3.05(d)_ and obtain pay-off letters evidencing payment of such
indebtedness pursuant to this _Section 3.05(d)_ in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Pensare prior to the Closing.

to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
or any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or to provide funds to or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise)
in any Person other than a Company Subsidiary.

  



  

(d)  Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company
Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and each such share is owned by the Company or another Company
Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens, options and rights of first refusal
on the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's voting rights, other than

Section 4.04   _Authority Relative to this Agreement_.

  



  

The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted by vote of those
voting at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, or by written consent has duly (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Merger and declared their advisability, and (iii) recommended that the
Company Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and directed that this Agreement and
the Transactions be submitted for consideration by the Company Stockholders.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the
Merger, the Written Consent and the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Pensare and Merger Sub, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general
equitable principles (the " _Remedies Exceptions_ "). The Company Board has
approved this Agreement and the Transactions and such approvals are sufficient
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL shall not apply to the Merger or any of the Transactions. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover statute is applicable to
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
affirmative vote of the holders of (A) a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, (B) a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock,
entitled to vote thereon and voting together on an as-converted basis, and
(C) at least 52.5% of the outstanding Series A Shares, Series B Shares, Series
B-1 Shares and Series D Shares of the Company entitled to vote thereon and
voting together as a single series (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "),
are the only votes of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.
The Written Consent, if executed and delivered, would qualify as the Company
Stockholder Approval and no additional approval or vote from any holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Company would then be necessary
to adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

Section 4.05   _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and subject to receipt of the Written Consent and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and the
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, filings and notifications
contemplated by _Section 4.05(b)_ , the performance of this Agreement by the
Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with or violate any United
States or non-United States statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code,
executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order (" _Law_
") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any
Permitted Lien) on any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Material Contract, except, with respect
to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not have or reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any United States federal, state, county or local or non-
United States government, governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal, or
judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i)
for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or
"blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger
notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), the filings with and consents of the
FCC or any bureau or subdivision thereof or any State Public Utility
Commission (" _State PUC_ ") competent to issue such consents (collectively, "
_FCC and State PUC Consents_ ") listed on _Section 4.05(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents
as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, except
for any such suspension or cancellation of a Company Permit that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation
of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, or (b) any Material Contract or Company Permit, except, in each
case, for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not
have or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

this Agreement, nor will any such transaction accelerate the time of payment
or vesting, or increase the amount, of any benefit or other compensation due
to any individual. The transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall not,

reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Action.

of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has (i) timely received a favorable

is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code or
(ii) is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and to
the knowledge of the Company no fact or event has occurred since the date of

investigations by, any Governmental Authority and, to the
Company's knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for the same.

except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ (as modified by the Company

_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such action, (A) the Company
promptly notifies Pensare, in writing, at least 24 hours (the " _Notice
Period_ ") before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering
into (or causing a Company Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition
Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior

version of the proposed agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (which
version shall be updated on a prompt basis), and a description of any
financing commitments relating thereto; (B) the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and the Company
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Pensare in good faith in respect of adjustments in the terms and conditions

constitute a Superior Proposal, if Pensare, in its discretion, proposes to
make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms
of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least 24 hours remains in
the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Pensare of any
such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions)); and (C) following the end of such Notice Period (as extended
pursuant to the preceding clause (B)) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into
account any adjustments made by Pensare during the Notice Period in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company has complied with its obligations under this _Section 7.05_.

any disclosures permitted under this _Section 7.05(e)_ that does not
contain either an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or
an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the stockholders of the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has
not changed the Company Board Recommendation.

facilitate, encourage or engage in (including by way of furnishing non-public
information), whether publicly or otherwise, any inquiries with respect to
any merger, purchase of ownership interests or assets of, recapitalization or
similar business combination transaction involving any Person that is not the
Company (" _Pensare Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) engage in any negotiations
or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties, books and
records or any Confidential Information of Pensare or data to, any Person in
connection with a Pensare Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into, engage in
and maintain discussions, investigations, due diligence or negotiations with
respect to any Pensare Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or

Pensare Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers,
efforts, discussions or negotiations, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or

agreement, partnership agreement or other contract to effect an Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Pensare Acquisition Proposal, or (vi) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing or otherwise authorize or permit any of its Representatives to take
any such action. Pensare shall, and shall instruct and cause Merger Sub and
any other Subsidiary of Pensare and each of their respective Representatives
to immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective Representatives) in
connection with a Pensare Acquisition Proposal. Pensare shall promptly notify
the Company (and in any event within twenty-four hours) of the receipt of any
Pensare Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof.

such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit. In addition, Pensare shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations
on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions and recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of

an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and

or in part on or arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified Liabilities_"), including
all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
in each case to the full extent permitted under applicable Law (and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Pensare shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party).
Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
7.07_ shall notify the Surviving Corporation upon learning of any such Action
(but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability
which it may have under this _Section 7.07_ except to the extent such failure
prejudices such party). The parties agree that all rights to indemnification
hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in
defense of any such action or suit, existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified

(b)  The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Articles V and VI of the by-laws of the
Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
the Company, unless such modification shall be required by law.

  



  

(c)  The Surviving Corporation shall purchase and have in place at

directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the benefit of
those Persons who are covered by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
of the Closing with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.
The DandO Tail shall provide for terms with respect to coverage, deductibles
and amounts that are no less favorable than those of the policy in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time for the benefit of the Company's
directors and officers, and shall remain in effect for the six-year period
following the Closing. Pensare shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain the DandO Tail in full force and effect for its full
term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for such insurance

the Company Subsidiaries.

prompt notice to the Company, of any event which a party becomes aware of
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing (or the earlier

occurrence, or non-occurrence of which causes or would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  to fail.

  



  

Section 7.09   _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,

action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as are necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make

reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities as are
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Merger. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take all such action.

each other with respect to the obtaining of all of the FCC and State PUC

69

 



    



  

(c)  Each of the parties shall keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying
the other parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject

to the extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with
the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications, including any documents,
information and data contained therewith, between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall take or cause to be
taken any action before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with

certain consents and waivers with respect to the Transactions may be required

party that have not been and may not be obtained. Neither the Company nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any liability to Pensare arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the Transactions or because of the termination of
any contract as a result thereof, and no such failure or termination shall
result in the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ , except
as expressly set forth therein. In addition, the parties agree that the
Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for all fees, costs and expenses
(including legal fees) incurred by the Company in connection with obtaining
any consent, amendment, modification or waiver from any counterparty to a

Section 10.10   _Legal Representation_.

  



  

Pensare, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates acknowledge
and agree that Gibson Dunn has acted as counsel for certain of the Company
Stockholders, the Company, and their respective Affiliates for several years
and that such stockholders reasonably anticipate that Gibson Dunn
will continue to represent them in future matters. Accordingly, Pensare,
Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates expressly consent to
Gibson Dunn's representation of the Company Stockholders in any post-Closing
matter in which the interests of Pensare, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Company Stockholders, on the other hand,
are adverse, including, without limitation, any matter relating to the
Transactions or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto, and whether or
not such matter is one in which Gibson Dunn may have previously advised the
Company Stockholders, the Company or their respective Affiliates.
Furthermore, Pensare and the Company irrevocably waive any right they may have
to discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the
representation of the Company or the Company Stockholders by Gibson Dunn in
the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent that such information or
documentation was privileged as to the Company Stockholders. Pensare, Merger
Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates further covenant and agree
that each shall not assert any claim against Gibson Dunn in respect of legal
services provided to the Company or its Affiliates by Gibson Dunn in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Upon and after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any attorney-client
relationship with Gibson Dunn, unless and to the extent Gibson Dunn is
specifically engaged in writing by the Surviving Corporation to represent the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing and either such engagement involves
no conflict of interest with respect to the Company Stockholders or their
respective Affiliates or the Company Stockholders or their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing at the time to such engagement.
Any such representation of the Surviving Corporation by Gibson Dunn after the
Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. If and to the
extent that, at any time subsequent to the Closing, Pensare, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates shall have the right to assert or
waive an attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between
the Company or its Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred
at any time prior to the Closing, Pensare, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to waive such
privilege only with the prior written consent of IVC (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  



  

Section 10.11   _No Presumption Against the Drafting Party_.

  



  

Each of Pensare, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to
this Agreement has been represented by legal counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly,
any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of
any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no
application and is expressly waived.

  



  

   

85

 



    



  

Section 10.12   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and,
accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger) in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate
and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation ("
_Bylaws_ "), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do
all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation,
subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate, and the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than three,
with at least one director in each of Class I, Class II and Class III. The

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial
Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors
shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at

Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that
annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election
and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their
earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, if the
number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned
by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in
each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the
number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. The Board is
hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign
members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid classes at the time
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore such
classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _Section
5.5_ hereof and except as otherwise provided in that certain Investor Rights
Agreement to which the Corporation is a party, dated as of ___________, 2019,
with certain holders of Common Stock (the " _Investor Rights Agreement "_),
newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely and
exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even
if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by
stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder
of the full term of the class of directors to which the new directorship was
added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her successor has
been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time with cause and only by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock -_Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation) and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes
created pursuant to this _Article V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws
also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), or by the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the
stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders
shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

  



  

Article VII

  

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ADVANCE NOTICE

  



  

Section 7.1 _Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be
called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is
hereby specifically denied. Except as provided in the foregoing
sentence, special meetings of stockholders may not be called by another
person or persons.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for
the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders
before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in
the manner provided in the Bylaws.

Article VIII

  

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment,
modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect
of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment,
modification or repeal.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, damages, claims and
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such
indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the
fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise
participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
_provided_ , _however_ , if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses
incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation's receipt of
an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section
8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_ , except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses,
the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_ , shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except
to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

Article IX

  

FORUM

  



  

Section 9.1 _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any
stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action
or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting
a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other
employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any
provision of the DGCL or this Certificate of Incorporation or the
Corporation's Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the
internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another
state court located within the State of Delaware, or if no state court located
within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for
the District of Delaware) in all cases subject to the court's having personal
jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Foreign Action_. If any action the subject matter of which is
within the scope of _Section 9.1_ is filed in a court other than a court
located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign Action_ ") in the name of
any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i)
the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the
State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce _Section 9.1_ (an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having
service of process made upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement
Action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as
agent for such stockholder.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
IX_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any
person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of
such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this _Article IX_ (including, without limitation, each portion of any
sentence of this _Article IX_ containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other
persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this _Article IX_.

Article X

  

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall
not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or
directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the
application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or
contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the
doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate
opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the
Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person
solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and
such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually
permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation
to pursue.

 BY LAWS 
 OF 
 TPx CORP. 
 (THE "CORPORATION")

  



  

Article I. 
  
 OFFICES

  



  

Section 1.1 Registered Office. The registered office of the Corporation
within the State of Delaware shall be located at either (a) the principal
place of business of the Corporation in the State of Delaware or (b) the
office of the corporation or individual acting as the
Corporation's registered agent in Delaware.

  



  

Section 1.2 Additional Offices. The Corporation may, in addition to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, have such other offices and places
of business, both within and outside the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") may from time to time
determine or as the business and affairs of the Corporation may require.

  



  

Article II. 
  
 STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

  



  

Section 2.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware and time and
on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice of
the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine
that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held
solely by means of remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_. At each
annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters shall elect
those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship that
expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact any other
business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Subject to the rights of the holders of any
outstanding series of the preferred stock of the Corporation ("
_Preferred Stock_ "), and to the requirements of applicable law, special
meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and may not be called by any
other person. Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place,
either within or outside of the State of Delaware, and at such and time and
on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in
the Corporation's notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its
sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place,
but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to
_Section 9.5(a)_.

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

  

Section 2.3 Notices. Written notice of each stockholders meeting stating the
place, if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting and the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is
different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by _Section 9.3_
to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, by the
Corporation not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the
meeting unless otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). If said notice is for a stockholders meeting
other than an annual meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business transacted at
such meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation's
notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto). Any meeting of stockholders as
to which notice has been given may be postponed, and any special meeting of
stockholders as to which notice has been given may be cancelled, by the Board
upon public announcement (as defined in _Section 2.7(c)_ ) given before the
date previously scheduled for such meeting.

  



  

Section 2.4 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
as the same may be amended or restated from time to time (the " _Certificate
of Incorporation_ ") or these By Laws, the presence, in person or by proxy,
at a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital
stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at
such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such
meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or
series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or
series shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the
transaction of such business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented
by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman
of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner
provided in _Section 2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders
present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or
to another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares
entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is
held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to
vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other
corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

   

2

 



    

  



  

Section 2.5 Voting of Shares.

  



  

(a) _Voting Lists_. The Secretary of the Corporation (the " _Secretary_ ")
shall prepare, or shall cause the officer or agent who has charge of the
stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare and make, at least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record
entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that if the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before
the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as
of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and
showing the address and the number and class of shares registered in the name
of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall require
the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic
contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place
of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place,
then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote
communication as permitted by _Section 9.5(a)_ , the list shall be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting. The stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the list required by this _Section 2.5(a)_ or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by
remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by
electronic transmission (as defined in _Section 9.3_ ), provided that any
such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in
its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such
person's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be
cast by written ballot.

  



  

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary until the meeting is
called to order, but shall be filed with the Secretary before being voted.
Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the
following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant
such authority. No stockholder shall have cumulative voting rights.

  



  

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed
to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

  



  

  

   

3

 



    

  



  

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the
stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or
persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu
of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which
the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at
all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of
directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a
majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the
matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, these By Laws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different
vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the
decision of such matter.

  



  

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. The Board may, and shall if required by law,
in advance of any meeting of stockholders, designate one or more persons as
inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise
serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may appoint one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace
any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or alternates are
appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding
shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies
and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine
and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their
determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their
count of all votes and ballots. No person who is a candidate for an office at
an election may serve as an inspector at such election. Each report of an
inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority
of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there
is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of
the inspectors.

Section 2.6 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may
be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or
not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place,
if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote
at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the
holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a
class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been
transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30
days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record
date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in
accordance with _Section 9.2_ , and shall give notice of the adjourned
meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned
meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. 

  



  

Section 2.7 Advance Notice for Business.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. No business may be transacted at an
annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i)
specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought
before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of
the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
annual meeting on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this
_Section 2.7(a)_ and on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (y) who complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 2.7(a)_ to the contrary, only persons nominated for election as
a director to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of the
annual meeting pursuant to _Section 3.2_ will be considered for election
at such meeting.

  



  

(i) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other
than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper
written form to the Secretary and such business must otherwise be a proper
matter for stockholder action. Subject to _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_ , a
stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to such business, to be
timely, must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices
of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor
earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the anniversary
date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that
is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the opening of
business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of
(x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close
of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of the annual meeting is first made by the Corporation. The public
announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting shall not commence a new
time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this
_Section 2.7(a)_.

  



  

   

5

 



    

  



  

(ii) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to
each such matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting
(A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of
any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such business
includes a proposal to amend these By Laws, the language of the proposed
amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting,
(B) the name and record address of such stockholder and the name and address
of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C) the
class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that
are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and by the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (D) a
description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and any
other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the
proposal of such business by such stockholder, (E) any material interest of
such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made in such business and (F) a representation that such
stockholder (or a qualified representative of such stockholder) intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business
before the meeting.

  



  

(iii) The foregoing notice requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations)
if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder's
intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and such stockholder has complied with
the requirements of such rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy
statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual
meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders
except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_ , provided, however, that once
business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance
with such procedures, nothing in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be deemed to
preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the Board or
the chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal
was not made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ or
that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the
information requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ , such proposal shall not be
presented for action at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ , if the stockholder (or a
qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business,
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(iv) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ , a stockholder

(a) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation,
except as may be otherwise provided by the terms of one or more series of
Preferred Stock with respect to the rights of holders of one or more series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors. Nominations of persons for election to
the Board at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors as set forth in the
Corporation's notice of such special meeting, may be made (i) by or at the
direction of the Board or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation (x) who

offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not later
than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the opening of
business on the 120th day before the anniversary date of the immediately
preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the

not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of the special meeting is first made by

period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice
as described in this _Section 3.2_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) to the contrary, in the event

all of the nominees for the additional directors to be elected or specifying
the size of the increased Board before the close of business on the 90th day
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders, a stockholder's notice required by this _Section 3.2_ shall
also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the
additional directorships created by such increase that are to be filled by
election at such annual meeting, if it shall be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the date on which such public announcement
was first made by the Corporation.

for election as a director (A) the name, age, business address and residence
address of the person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of the
person, (C) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (D)

disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant
to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (A) the name and
record address of such stockholder as they appear on the Corporation's books
and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made, (B) the class or series and number of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by
such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
nomination is made, (C) a description of all arrangements or understandings
relating to the nomination to be made by such stockholder among such
stockholder, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is
made, each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their
names), (D) a representation that such stockholder (or a qualified
representative of such stockholder) intends to appear in person or by proxy
at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (E) any other
information relating to such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on
whose behalf the nomination is made that would be required to be disclosed in
a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such
notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to
being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.

that any nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this

does not satisfy the information requirements of this _Section 3.2_ , then
such nomination shall not be considered at the meeting in question.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 3.2_ , if the

at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the nomination,
such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect
of such nomination may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(f) In addition to the provisions of this _Section 3.2_ , a stockholder shall
also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth

of Incorporation.

on behalf of the appropriate person;

  



  

(iii) the Corporation has received a guarantee of signature of the person
signing such endorsement or instruction or such other reasonable assurance
that the endorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized as the
Corporation may request;

  



  

(iv) the transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer imposed by the
Corporation that is enforceable in accordance with _Section 7.8(a)_ ; and

  



  

(v) such other conditions for such transfer as shall be provided for under
applicable law have been satisfied.

  



    

  

(b) Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and
not absolutely, the Corporation shall so record such fact in the entry of
transfer if, when the certificate for such shares is presented to the
Corporation for transfer or, if such shares are uncertificated, when
the instruction for registration of transfer thereof is presented to the
Corporation, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do
so.

Section 7.7 Registered Stockholders. Before due presentment for registration
of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the Corporation or of an
instruction requesting registration of transfer of uncertificated shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled
to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger and the other books and
records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all the
rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who is
the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence of
beneficial ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as
are provided under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records
of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.8 Effect of the Corporation's Restriction on Transfer.

  



  

(a) A written restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of
shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that
may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by the DGCL and
noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice, offering circular or
prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares
within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such
shares, may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

  



  

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares
are uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering
circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of
such shares prior to or within a reasonable time after the issuance or
transfer of such shares.

  



  

Section 7.9 Regulations. The Board shall have power and authority to make
such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable requirement
of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with respect to the
issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock or
certificates representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more transfer
agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that
certificates representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or
registrar so appointed.

Article VIII. 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 Right to Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made
a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "
_Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, damages,
claims and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by
such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that,
except as provided in _Section 8.3_  with respect to proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 8.2 Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 8.1_ , an Indemnitee shall also have
the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited
by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement of
expenses_ "); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the
Corporation's receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_
"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.3 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under _Section 8.1_
or _Section 8.2_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after
a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in the
case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable
period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of
prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by
an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter
a " _final adjudication_ ") that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable
standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a determination by
its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this _Article VIII_
or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



    

18

 



    



  

Section 8.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any other right,
which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws, an agreement, a vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.5 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.6 Indemnification of Other Persons. This _Article VIII_ shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized
or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other
than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent
of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to
the fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VIII_ with respect to
the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this
_Article VIII_.

  



  

Section 8.7 Amendments. Any repeal or amendment of this _Article VIII_ by the
Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable law,
or the adoption of any other provision of these By Laws inconsistent with this
_Article VIII_ , will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in applicable
law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights to
Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not
in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided however, that
amendments or repeals of this _Article VIII_ shall require the affirmative
vote of the stockholders holding at least 66.7% of the voting power of all
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.

  



    

19

 



    



  

Section 8.8 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , (a)
references to " _other enterprise_ " shall include any employee benefit plan;
(b) references to " _fines_ " shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to " _serving
at the request of the Corporation_ " shall include any service that imposes
duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest
of the Corporation" for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.9 Contract Rights. The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall
continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent
or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs,
executors and administrators.

  



  

Section 8.10 Severability. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of this
_Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

  



  

Article IX. 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.1 Place of Meetings. If the place of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these
By Laws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall
be held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided,
however, if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting
shall not be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote
communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting shall not be
held at any place.

  



  

Section 9.2 Fixing Record Dates.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which
record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a
later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.2(a)_ at the
adjourned meeting.

  



    

20

 



     



  

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9.3 Means of Giving Notice.

  



  

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any director,
such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a
nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of
facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or
(iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director
will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and
fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited
with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at
the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if
sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission
number for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if
sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such
director appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any
other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or
number (as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation.

  


 

   

21

 



    

  



  

(b) _Notice to Stockholders_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any
stockholder, such notice may be given (i) in writing and sent either by hand
delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service for next day delivery, or (ii) by means
of a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder, to the
extent permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 232 of
the DGCL. A notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (i) if
given by hand delivery, when actually received by the stockholder, (ii) if
sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States
mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at
the stockholder's address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation,
(iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight
delivery service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid,
addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address appearing on the
stock ledger of the Corporation, and (iv) if given by a form of
electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is
given and otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above, (A) if by
facsimile transmission, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has
consented to receive notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the stockholder of such specified posting, upon the later of (1)
such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by any
other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. A
stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent to receiving notice by means
of electronic communication by giving written notice of such revocation to
the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the
Corporation's transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of
notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as
a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.

  



  

(c) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process, including but not limited to
transmission by telex, facsimile telecommunication, electronic mail, telegram
and cablegram.

  



  

(d) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under
any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws
shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who
share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom
such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(e) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing
of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate
shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was
given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom
communication is unlawful.

  



  

   

22

 



    

  



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings, or (2) all, and at least
two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on
securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such
stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown on the records of the
Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice
to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or meeting that shall be
taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same force
and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such stockholder
shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth such
stockholder's then current address, the requirement that notice be given to
such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by
the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the
Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was
not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to
Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection (1) of the first
sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not
be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given
by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 9.4 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By Laws, a
written waiver of such notice, signed before or after the date of such
meeting by the person or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to said notice, shall be deemed
equivalent to such required notice. All such waivers shall be kept with the
books of the Corporation. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except where a person attends for the express purpose
of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the
meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.5 Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.

  



  

(a) _Stockholder Meetings_. If authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may
adopt, stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and proxy holders not
physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of
remote communication:

  



  

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and, if entitled to vote, to vote on matters
submitted to the applicable stockholders, including an opportunity to read or
hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such
proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes
other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of
such votes or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

   

23

 



    

  



  

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the
meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that
the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.6 Dividends. The Board may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the
Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of
capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate
of Incorporation.

  



  

Section 9.7 Reserves. The Board may set apart out of the funds of the
Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper
purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

  



  

Section 9.8 Contracts and Negotiable Instruments. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws,
any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be executed
and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such officer or
officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the Board may
from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or confined to
specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any contract, bond,
deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the
Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board, the Chairman
of the Board Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief Financial Officer,
the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to execute and
deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the
name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or employees of the
Corporation under such person's supervision and authority, it
being understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not
relieve such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such
delegated power.

  



  

Section 9.9 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by
the Board.

  



  

Section 9.10 Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in
such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing it or a
facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced.

  



  

   

24

 



    

  



  

Section 9.11 Books and Records. The books and records of the Corporation may
be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may
from time to time be designated by the Board.

  

  

    

  



  

Section 9.12 Resignation. Any director, committee member or officer may
resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the
Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein,
or at the time of receipt of such notice if no time is specified or the
specified time is earlier than the time of such receipt. Unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
to make it effective.

  



  

Section 9.13 Surety Bonds. Such officers, employees and agents of the
Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer,
President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the
faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control belonging
to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may
determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and
the bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.

  



  

Section 9.14 Securities of Other Corporations. Powers of attorney, proxies,
waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other instruments
relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name
of and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer, President, any Vice President or any officers authorized by
the Board. Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the
Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to
vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security holders of any
corporation in which the Corporation may own securities, or to consent in
writing, in the name of the Corporation as such holder, to any action by such
corporation, and at any such meeting or with respect to any such consent
shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power incident to the
ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation
might have exercised and possessed. The Board may from time to time confer
like powers upon any other person or persons.

  



  

Section 9.15 Amendments. The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the By Laws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By Laws. The By Laws
also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders;
provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the voting power (except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.7_
) of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or
repeal the By Laws.

 _Section 6._  If any term or other provision of this Amendment is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Amendment shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Amendment is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Amendment so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Amendment are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

  



  

 _Section 7._  This Amendment may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

 _Section 8._  This Amendment shall for all purposes be deemed to
be made under and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York without reference to its principles of conflicts of law which

the parties hereby agrees that any action, proceeding or claim against it
arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be brought and
enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, and irrevocably submits
to such personal jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive. Each of
the parties hereby waives any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and
that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

2. _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_.

  



  

2.1 Resale Shelf Registration Rights.

  



  

2.1.1 _Registration Statement Covering Resale of Registrable
Securities_. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed with the Commission, no later than thirty (30) days following the date
of this Agreement, a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act registering the
resale from time to time by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities held
by Holders (the " _Resale Shelf Registration Statement_ "). The Resale Shelf
Registration Statement shall be on Form S-3 (" _Form S-3_ ") or, if Form S-3
is not then available to the Company, on Form S-1 or such other appropriate
form permitting Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale by
such Holders. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as
possible after filing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following
the filing deadline (the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "); provided, that the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be extended to ninety (90) days after the filing
deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by, and receives comments
from, the Commission. Once effective, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that
such Registration Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that
another Registration Statement is available, under the Securities Act at all
times until the expiration of the Effectiveness Period. The
Registration Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this _subsection
2.1.1_ shall contain a prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to
sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
(or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in
effect) at any time beginning on the effective date for such Registration
Statement (subject to lock-up restrictions provided in Section 6.1 of this
Agreement), and shall provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold
pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and
requested by, Holders.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

2.1.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company shall
notify the Holders in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement as soon as practicable, and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
becomes effective, and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of
copies of the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments,
supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein (including each
preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any
documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement
or such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner described in
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

  



  

2.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.1.1 above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period.
If any Resale Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1.1 is
filed on Form S-3 and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use Form
S-3 for secondary sales, the Company shall promptly notify the Holders of such
ineligibility and use its best efforts to file a shelf registration on Form
S-1 or other appropriate form as promptly as practicable to replace the shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 Shelf and have the such replacement Resale
Shelf Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable
and to cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available, for
the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all
such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that at any time the Company once again becomes eligible
to use Form S-3, the Company shall cause such replacement Resale Shelf
Registration Statement to be amended, or shall file a new replacement Resale
Shelf Registration Statement, such that the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement is once again on Form S-3.

  



  

2.1.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in this
Section 2.1, in the event the Commission informs the Company that all of the
Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be
registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a " _New Registration Statement_ "), on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is
not then available to the Company for such registration statement, on such
other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a
secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or
New Registration Statement, the Company shall be obligated to use its
reasonable best efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration
of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-
available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the
Commission staff (the " _SEC Guidance_ "), including without limitation, the
Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a
limitation of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered
on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and
notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the
Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable
Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a holder as to its
Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered
on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on
the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders, subject to a
determination by the Commission that certain Holders must be reduced first
based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the
event the Company amends the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a
New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the
Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to
the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to register
for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration
Statement.

2.1.5 _Demand Takedown_.

  



  

(a) If the Company shall receive a request from (x) the Holders of at
least 1,000,000 shares of Registrable Securities, provided that, unless the
request relates to the sale of all remaining Registrable Securities held by
such holders, the estimated market value of the Registrable Securities is at
least $10,000,000 (the requesting holder(s) shall be referred to herein as the
" _Requesting Holder_ ") that the Company effect an Underwritten Takedown of
all or any portion of the Requesting Holder's Registrable Securities, and
specifying the intended method of disposition thereof (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be an underwritten Block Trade), then the Company
shall promptly give notice of such requested Underwritten Takedown (each such
request shall be referred to herein as a " _Demand Takedown_ ") within five
(5) Business Days after receiving such Demand Takedown to the other Holders
and thereupon shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as
expeditiously as possible, the offering in such Underwritten Takedown of:

  



  

(i) subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2.4, all
Registrable Securities for which the Requesting Holder has requested
such offering under Section 2.1.5(a), and

  



  

(ii) subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.2.4, all other
Registrable Securities that any Selling Holders have requested the Company to
offer by request received by the Company within seven (7) Business Days after
such Holders receive the Company's notice of the Demand Takedown, all to the
extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended
methods thereof as aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities so to be offered.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the expiration of the seven (7) Business Day-
period referred to in Section 2.1.5(a)(ii), the Company will notify all
Selling Holders of the identities of the other Selling Holders and the number
of shares of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(c) The Company shall only be required to effectuate one
Underwritten Takedown within any three (3) month period.

  



  

(d) If the managing underwriter in an Underwritten Takedown advises
the Company and the Requesting Holder that, in its view, the number of shares
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such underwritten
offering exceeds the largest number of shares that can be sold without having
an adverse effect on such offering, including the price at which such shares
can be sold, the shares included in such Underwritten Takedown will be
reduced by the Registrable Securities held by the Selling Holders (applied on
a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by
such Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain
Holders must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Holders).

  



  



  

2.1.6 Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall not be
counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.2.

  



  

2.2 _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1 _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time on
or after (i) the date hereof with respect to the Private Placement Warrants
(or underlying securities), Working Capital Warrants (or underlying
securities) and Registrable Securities not described in the following clause
(ii) or (ii) three months prior to the applicable Release Date with respect to
the Founder Shares or Business Combination Shares, (a) the holders of a
majority-in-interest of such Founder Shares, Working Capital Warrants (or
underlying securities) or Private Placement Warrants (or underlying
securities), as the case may be, held by such Holders (other than
MasTec), (b) the holders of a majority-in-interest of such Business
Combination Shares held by such Holders, or (c) MasTec (as applicable, the "
_Demanding Holder_ ") may make a written demand for Registration under the
Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities (a " _Demand
Registration_ "). Any demand for a Demand Registration shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will within ten (10) days of
the Company's receipt of the Demand Registration notify all holders of
Registrable Securities of the demand, and each holder of Registrable
Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such holder's
Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each, a " _Demand
Requesting Holder_ ") shall so notify the Company within ten (10) days after
the receipt by the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any
such request, the Demanding Holder and the Demand Requesting Holders shall be
entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in the Demand
Registration, subject to Section 2.2.4 and the provisos set forth in Section
3.1.1, to be effected by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than 60 days after receipt of such Demand Registration. The
Company shall not be obligated to effect more than an aggregate of (i) two
(2) Demand Registrations under clause (a) of this Section 2.1.1, (ii) four
(4) Demand Registrations under clause (b) of this Section 2.2.1, and (iii) one
(1) Demand Registration under clause (c) of this Section 2.2.1.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and its
designees may only make a demand on one occasion and only in the five-year
period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement on
Form S-1 filed with the Commission in connection with the Company's initial
public offering. For the avoidance of doubt, a Demand Registration initiated
under one of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 2.2.1 will not count as a
Demand Registration effected under any of the other such clauses,
notwithstanding that any holder of Registrable Securities and having demand
registration rights under any of such other clauses elects to participate in
such Demand Registration pursuant to their participation rights under this
paragraph.

2.2.2 _Effective Registration_. A Registration will not count as a
Demand Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to such Demand Registration has been declared
effective and the Company has complied with all of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such
Registration Statement has been declared effective, the offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by
any stop order or injunction of the Commission or any other governmental
agency or court, the Registration Statement with respect to such Demand
Registration will be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders who
initiated such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue
the offering and notify the Company in writing, but in no event later than
five (5) days of such election; provided, further, that the Company shall not
be obligated to file a second Registration Statement until a
Registration Statement that has been filed is counted as a Demand
Registration or is terminated.

  



  

2.2.3 _Underwritten Offering_. If MasTec (in the case of a Demand
Registration initiated by MasTec) or a majority-in-interest of the other
Demanding Holders who initiate a Demand Registration so elect and such
holders so advise the Company as part of their written demand for a Demand
Registration, the offering of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an underwritten offering (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, may be an underwritten Block Trade). In such
event, the right of any holder to include its Registrable Securities in such
Registration shall be conditioned upon such holder's participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of such holder's Registrable Securities in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing
to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in reasonable and customary form with the Underwriter
or Underwriters selected for such underwriting by a majority-in-interest of
the holders initiating the Demand Registration.

  



  

2.2.4 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten
offering, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the
Demand Requesting Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number of
shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders and Demand
Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other
shares of Common Stock or other securities which the Company desires to sell
and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights
held by other stockholders of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares that can be sold in such
offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing,
the distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares, as applicable, the "
_Maximum Number of Shares_ "), then the Company shall include in such
Registration: (i) the Registrable Securities as to which Demand Registration
has been requested by the Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting Holders (if
any) (pro rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such
Demanding Holder and Demand Requesting Holders (if any) has requested be
included in such Registration, regardless of the number of shares held by
each such Demanding Holder (such proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro
Rata_ ")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares;
(ii) to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (i), the Registrable Securities of holders
exercising their rights to Register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
Section 2.3; (iii) to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the shares of Common
Stock or other securities that the Company desires to sell that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (iv) to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), the shares of Common Stock or other securities registrable
pursuant to the terms of the Unit Purchase Option issued to EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. or its designees in connection with the Company's initial public
offering (the " _Unit Purchase Option_ " and such registrable securities, the
" _Option Securities_ ") as to which Piggy-Back Registration has been
requested by the holders thereof, Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Shares and (v) to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares have not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv), the shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other
persons that the Company is obligated to Register pursuant to written
contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

2.2.5 _Withdrawal_. A Demanding Holder, a Demand Requesting Holder or
a Requesting Holder may elect to withdraw all or a portion of its
Registrable Securities included in a Demand Registration or an Underwritten
Takedown for any reason or no reason at all by giving written notice to the
Company and/or the Underwriter or Underwriters of their request to withdraw
prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to such Demand Registration. If the majority-in-
interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed offering relating
to a Demand Registration, then such Registration shall not count as a Demand
Registration provided for in this Section 2.2.

  



  

2.3 _Piggy-Back Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If at any time on or after the date hereof
the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, equity securities, by the Company for its own account or
for stockholders of the Company for their account (or by the Company and by
stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to Section
2.2), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any
employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to the Company's existing stockholders, (iii)
for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v) filed pursuant to any
Subscription Agreement (as such term is defined in the Business Combination
Agreement), then the Company shall (x) give written notice of such proposed
filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but in
no event less than ten (10) days (or in the case of a Block Trade, five (5)
Business Days) before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe
the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the
intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing
Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the
holders of Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to Register
the sale of such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders
may request in writing within five (5) Business Days following receipt of
such notice (a " _Piggy-Back Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good
faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Registration
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company and to permit
the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All holders of
Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities through a
Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or Underwriters shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in reasonable and customary form with the
Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-Back Registration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and its
designees may exercise its rights under this section only in the seven-year
period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement on Form
S-1 filed with the Commission in connection with the Company's initial public
offering.

2.3.2 _Reduction of Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten

contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, the Registrable Securities as to which
Registration has been requested under this Section 2.3, and the shares of

the written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders
of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, then the Company shall

(A) the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires
to sell for its own account that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; (B) to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or
other securities, if any, comprised of Registrable Securities, as to which
Registration has been requested pursuant to the applicable written
contractual Piggy-Back Registration rights of Holders pursuant to Section
2.3.1, Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; and (C) to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the shares of Common Stock

without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

  



  

2.3.3 _Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such Holder's request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a
withdrawal by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement at any time prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement in connection with a Piggy-Back
Registration. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company shall pay all
expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in connection with
such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in Section 3.3.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

2.3.4 _Unlimited Piggy-Back Registration Rights_. For purposes of

not be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected
under Section 2.2 hereof.

Section 2, if the Holders desire to effect a Block Trade, then
notwithstanding any other time periods in this Section 2, the Holders shall
provide written notice to the Company at least five (5) Business Days prior

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate such Block Trade.
The Holders shall use reasonable best efforts to work with the Company and the
Underwriters (including by disclosing the maximum number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be the subject of such Block Trade) in order to
facilitate preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus and other
offering documentation related to the Block Trade and any related due
diligence and comfort procedures.

  



  

3. _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

  



  

3.1 _Filings; Information_. Whenever the Company is required to
effect the Registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2,
the Company shall use its best efforts to effect the Registration and sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

  



  

3.1.1 _Filing Registration Statement_. The Company shall, as
expeditiously as possible and in any event within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a request for a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1,
prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-3, if
then available to the Company for such Registration, or if Form S-3 is not
then available to the Company for such Registration, then on any other form
for which the Company then qualifies and which counsel for the Company shall
deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale of all
Registrable Securities to be Registered thereunder in accordance with
the intended method(s) of distribution thereof, and shall use its best
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective
for the period required by Section 3.1.3; provided, however, that the Company
shall have the right to defer any Demand Registration for up to sixty (60)
days, and any Piggy-Back Registration for such period as may be applicable to
deferment of any Demand Registration to which such Piggy-Back Registration
relates, in each case if the Company shall furnish to the holders a
certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or President of
the Company stating that Adverse Disclosure would be required to be set forth
in such Registration Statement; provided, further, however, that the Company
shall not have the right to exercise the right set forth in the immediately
preceding proviso more than once and more than a total of ninety (90) days in
any 365-day period in respect of Demand Registrations hereunder.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

3.1.2 _Copies; Participation_. The Company shall, at least five (5)

counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each
amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary prospectus), and such other documents as the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration or legal counsel for any
such holders may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities owned by such holders. The Company shall permit a
representative of any Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holder to
participate, at such Holder's sole cost and expense, in the preparation of
any Registration Statement, each Prospectus included therein or filed with
the Commission, and each amendment or supplement thereto, and will give each
such person or entity access to its books and records and such opportunities
to discuss the business, finances and accounts of the Company with the
Company's officers, directors and independent public accountants who have
certified the Company's financial statements as shall be necessary, in the
opinion of such Holders' respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable
investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Company shall not
file any Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement
thereto, to which a Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration shall have reasonably objected on the grounds that
any portion(s) of such Registration Statement or Prospectus or supplement or
amendment thereto does not comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder.

  



  

3.1.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. The Company shall prepare and file
with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until
all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s)
of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or such securities
have been withdrawn (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  



  

3.1.4 _Notification_. After the filing of a Registration Statement,
the Company shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) Business Days
after such filing, notify the holders of Registrable Securities included in
such Registration Statement of such filing, and shall further notify such

(2) Business Days of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) when such
Registration Statement becomes effective; (ii) when any post-effective
amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the
issuance or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the
Company shall take all actions required to prevent the entry of such stop
order or to remove it if entered); and (iv) any request by the Commission for
any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or any Prospectus
relating thereto or for additional information or of the occurrence of an
event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
securities covered by such Registration Statement, such prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
including documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide
such holders and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such
documents and comment thereon, and the Company shall not file any Registration
Statement or prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, including
documents incorporated by reference, to which such holders or their legal
counsel shall reasonably object.

reasonable best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities

things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;

generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this paragraph or subject itself to taxation in
any such jurisdiction.

  



  

3.1.6 _Agreements for Disposition_. The Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement
in reasonable and customary form) and take such other actions as are
reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Company in any underwriting agreement which are made to or for the
benefit of any Underwriters, to the extent applicable, shall also be made to
and for the benefit of the holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement, and the representations, warranties and covenants
of the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration

effected by or at the direction of Holders pursuant to this Agreement, the
Selling Holders holding a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities
requested to be sold in any Registration shall have the right to select an
Underwriter or Underwriters in connection with such Registration, which
Underwriter or Underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In
connection with a Registration pursuant to this Agreement, the Company
shall enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in
reasonable and customary form) and take such other actions as are reasonably
required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in such Registration, including, if necessary, the engagement of a
"qualified independent underwriter" in connection with the qualification of
the underwriting arrangements with the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.

  



  

3.1.8. _Records_. The Company shall make available for inspection by
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration

Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information
requested by any of them in connection with such Registration Statement.

  



  

3.1.9. _Opinions and Comfort Letters_. The Company shall furnish to
each holder of Registrable Securities included in any Registration
Statement a signed counterpart, addressed to such holder, of (i) any opinion
of counsel to the Company delivered to any Underwriter and (ii) any comfort
letter from the Company's independent public accountants delivered to any
Underwriter. In the event no legal opinion is delivered to any Underwriter,
the Company shall furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities included
in such Registration Statement, at any time that such holder elects to use a
prospectus, an opinion of counsel to the Company to the effect that the
Registration Statement containing such prospectus has been declared effective
and that no stop order is in effect.

  



  

3.1.10. _Earnings Statement_. The Company shall comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act,
and make available to its stockholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement covering a period of twelve (12) months, beginning within
three (3) months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which
earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

  



  

3.1.11. _Listing_. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities included in any Registration to be listed on such
exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same manner as similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or designated or, if no such
similar securities are then listed or designated, in a manner satisfactory to
the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
Registration.

  



  

3.1.12. _Transfer Agent_. The Company shall provide a transfer agent or
warrant agent, as applicable, and registrar for all such
Registrable Securities no later than the effective date of the Registration
Statement.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

3.1.13. _Misstatements_. The Company shall notify the holders at any
time when a prospectus relating to such Registration Statement is required to
be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a
result of which the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as
then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission
to state a material fact required to be stated in a Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading (a " _Misstatement_
"), and then to correct such Misstatement.

  



  

3.2 _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall bear all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any Registration Statement or Prospectus
required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement, and any amendment or
supplement relating thereto, and all expenses incurred in performing or
complying with its other obligations under this Agreement, whether or not the
Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i)
all Registration and filing fees and fees of any securities exchange on which
the Common Stock is then listed; (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees and disbursements of counsel
for the Underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Securities); (iii) printing, messenger, telephone and delivery
expenses; (iv) the Company's internal expenses (including, without
limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees); (v) the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable
Securities as required by Section 3.1.11; (vi) Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority fees; (vii) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and
fees and expenses for independent certified public accountants retained by the
Company (including the expenses or costs associated with the delivery of any
opinions or comfort letters requested pursuant to Section 3.1.9); (viii) the
fees and expenses of any special experts retained by the Company in connection
with such Registration; and (ix) the fees and expenses of one legal counsel
selected by the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Registrable
Securities included in such Registration; provided that if any Registrable
Securities included in such Registration are held by MasTec then such counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to MasTec. The Company shall have no
obligation to pay any underwriting discounts or selling
commissions attributable to the Registrable Securities being sold by the
holders thereof, which underwriting discounts or selling commissions shall be
borne by such holders. Additionally, in an underwritten offering, all selling
stockholders and the Company shall bear the expenses of the underwriter pro
rata in proportion to the respective amount of shares each is selling in such
offering. Additionally, in an underwritten offering, all selling stockholders
and the Company shall bear the expenses of the underwriter pro rata in
proportion to the respective amount of shares each is selling in such
offering.

  



  

3.3 _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide such information as may reasonably be
requested by the Company, or the managing Underwriter, if any, in connection
with the preparation of any Registration Statement, including amendments and
supplements thereto, in order to effect the Registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 2 and in connection
with the Company's obligation to comply with federal and applicable state
securities laws.

  



  

3.4 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No
person may participate in any underwritten offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and (ii)
completes and executes all customary questionnaires, indemnities, lock-up
agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

3.5 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or
prospectus contains a Misstatement or of the happening of any event of the
kind described in Section 3.1.4(iv), each of the Holders shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has received copies
of a supplemented or amended prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such
notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time
would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure (as defined below) or
would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial
statements that are unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the
Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time,
but in no event more than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the
Company to be necessary for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises
its rights under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, as
promptly as practicable after their receipt of the notice referred to above,
their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with
any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The Company shall
immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during which it
exercised its rights under this Section 3.6. " _Adverse Disclosure_ " shall
mean any public disclosure of material non-public information, which
disclosure, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the
Company, after consultation with counsel to the Company, (i) would be
required to be made in any Registration Statement or Prospectus in order for
the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus not to contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein (in the case of any prospectus and any
preliminary prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, (ii) would not be required to be made at such time
if the Registration Statement were not being filed, and (iii) the Company has
a bona fide business purpose for not making such information public.

  



  

3.6 _Other Covenants and Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall
own Registrable Securities: (a) the Company will not file any
Registration Statement or Prospectus included therein or any other filing or
document with the Commission which refers to any Holder of
Registrable Securities as a selling securityholder by name or otherwise
without the prior written approval of such Holder; (b) the Company, at all
times while it shall be reporting under the Exchange Act, covenants to use
reasonable best efforts to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act; (c) the Company further covenants that it shall
take such further action as any holder may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of the
Common Stock held by such Holder without Registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act, including providing any legal opinions; and (d) upon
the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written
certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with
the requirements set forth in the foregoing clauses (b) and (c).

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

4. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

  



  

4.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities, and each of
their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors, partners,
members, equityholders, attorneys, advisors and agents, and each person or
entity, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) each Holder of Registrable
Securities (each, an " _Holder Indemnified Party_ "), from and against any
expenses, losses, judgments, actions, claims, proceedings (whether commenced
or threatened), damages or liabilities, whether joint or several
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), arising out of or based upon any Misstatement
contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of such
Registrable Securities was Registered under the Securities Act,
any preliminary Prospectus, final Prospectus or summary Prospectus contained
in such Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus, final Prospectus or summary
Prospectus, or any violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule
or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to
action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
Registration; and the Company shall promptly reimburse the Holder
Indemnified Party for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Holder Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending
any such Losses, except, with respect to any Holder of Registrable Securities,
to the extent such Holder of Registrable Securities is liable to indemnify
the Company for such Losses pursuant to Section 4.2. The Company also shall
indemnify any Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers,
affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who
controls such Underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification provided above in this Section 4.1.

  



  

4.2 _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each
Selling Holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any
Registration is being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this
Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such Selling Holder and the
Company has required all Selling Holders to provide such an undertaking on the
same terms, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors
and officers and each underwriter (if any), and each other Selling Holder and
each other person, if any, who controls another Selling Holder or such
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any
Losses, insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based upon any
Misstatement contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was Registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary Prospectus, final Prospectus or summary Prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if the
Misstatement was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by such Selling Holder expressly for use
therein, and shall reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and
each other Selling Holder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by any of them in connection with investigation or defending any such Loss.
Each Selling Holder's indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several
and not joint and shall be proportional to and limited to the amount of any
net proceeds actually received by such Selling Holder in connection with the
sale of Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement from which such
Losses arise. Each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
any Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers, affiliates,
directors, partners, members and agents and each person who controls such
Underwriter to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to
indemnification of the Company.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

4.3 _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt
by any person of any notice of any Loss in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, such person (the " _Indemnified Party_
") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any other
person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other person (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the Loss; provided, however, that the
failure by the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying
Party may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. If
the Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or
action brought against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent
that it wishes, jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control
of the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume control of the defense of such claim or action, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that in any action in which both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are named as defendants, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (but no more
than one such separate counsel, in addition to local counsel) to represent
the Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to
liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees
and expenses of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based
upon the written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation
of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry
of judgment or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of any Losses for which the Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification hereunder if such settlement or judgment includes any non-
monetary remedies, requires an admission of fault or culpability on the part
of the Indemnified Party or does not include an unconditional release from
all liability of the Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses.

  



  

4.4 _Contribution_.

  



  

4.4.1 If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Sections
4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any
Loss referred to herein, then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnified Parties
and the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the actions or omissions which
resulted in such Loss. The relative fault of any Indemnified Party and any
Indemnifying Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the Misstatement relates to information supplied by such Indemnified
Party or such Indemnifying Party (in the case of a Holder, such Misstatement
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein) and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such Misstatement.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

4.4.2 The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding Section
4.4.1. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
Loss referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 4.4, no Holder of Registrable Securities shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the net
proceeds (after payment of any underwriting fees, discounts, commissions or
taxes) actually received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. No person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

4.5 _Survival_. The indemnification provided for under this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer,
director or controlling person of such Indemnified Party and shall
survive the transfer of securities.

  



  

5. _RULE 144_. The Company covenants that it shall timely file any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and shall take such further action as may be required or as the holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holders to sell Registrable Securities without Registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

  



  

6. _LOCK-UP_.

  



  

6.1 _Lock-Up_. Each Holder agrees that, during the period commencing
on the date hereof and ending on the applicable Release Date, the
Holder shall not (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell,
hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or
agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put
equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position
within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated
thereunder, with respect to any applicable portion of Founder Shares or
Business Combination Shares owned by him, her or it, (ii) enter into any swap
or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any applicable portion of Founder
Shares or Business Combination Shares owned by him, her or it, whether any
such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or
otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction
specified in clause (i) or (ii). The Company agrees that upon the occurrence
of an Early Release Date, it shall notify each TPx Holder that such Early
Release Date has occurred as promptly as practicable.

7. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

  



  

7.1 _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants
that, except as set forth in any Subscription Agreement, no person, other
than a holder of the Registrable Securities and the representative of the
underwriters of the Company's initial public offering, has any right to
require the Company to Register any shares of the Company's capital stock for
sale or to include shares of the Company's capital stock in any Registration
filed by the Company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own
account or for the account of any other person. Further, the Company shall not
hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is
inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable
Securities and the Company represents and warrants that this Agreement
supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with
similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict between any such
agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail.

  



  

7.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be
assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such Holder of Registrable
Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer of
Registrable Securities by any such Holder. This Agreement and the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the

Securities or of any assignee of the applicable holder of Registrable
Securities. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits
on any persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in
Article 4 and this Section 7.2. No assignment by any party hereto of such
party's rights, duties and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or
obligate the Company unless and until the Company shall have received (i)
written notice of such assignment and (ii) the written agreement of the
assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which may be accomplished by an
addendum or certificate of joinder to this Agreement).

7.4 _Severability_. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term
or provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or

contemporaneous agreements, representations, understandings, negotiations and

limitation the Prior Agreement.

  



  

7.7 _Modifications and Amendments_. Upon the written consent of the
Company and the Holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent
(66-2/3%) of the Registrable Securities (including MasTec and IVC if such
party then holds Registrable Securities) at the time in question, compliance
with any of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this
Agreement may be waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions
may be amended or modified; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one
holder of Registrable Securities, solely in its capacity as a holder of the
shares of Common Stock of the Company, in a manner that is materially
different from the other Holders of Registrable Securities (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of the Holder so affected; provided, further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof (i) of
the definition of "Release Date" with respect to the Founder Shares or
the terms of Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 in respect of the Founder Shares
and/or (ii) that adversely affects the IVC Holders in a manner that is
adverse and different from the other Holders, shall require the consent of
IVC. No course of dealing between any holders of Registrable Securities or
the Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on the part of
a holder of Registrable Securities or the Company in exercising any rights or
remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights
or remedies of any holder of Registrable Securities or the Company. No single
or partial exercise of any rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party
shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or
remedies hereunder or thereunder by such party.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

7.8 _Titles and Headings_. Titles and headings of sections of this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of
any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

7.9 _Waivers and Extensions_. Any party to this Agreement may waive
any right, breach or default which such party has the right to waive,
provided that such waiver will not be effective against the waiving party
unless it is in writing, is signed by such party, and specifically refers to
this Agreement. Waivers may be made in advance or after the right waived has
arisen or the breach or default waived has occurred. Any waiver may be

Investor Rights Agreement

  



  

See attached.

  



  

   



 



    



  

FORM OF INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

  



  

This Investor Rights Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of
[●], 2019 (the " _Effective Date_ "), by and between TPx Corp. (f/k/a Pensare
Acquisition Corp.), a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
Investcorp International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Investcorp_ ").
Each capitalized term used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in _Article V_.

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated
January 31, 2019, by and among the Company, Tango Merger Sub Corp., and U.S.
Telepacific Holdings Corp. (the " _Business Combination Agreement_ "), certain
of the stockholders and management personnel of U.S. Telepacific Holdings
Corp. (the " _Investcorp Group_ ") are receiving, collectively, [●] shares of
the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_
"); and

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business
Combination Agreement, the Company and Investcorp desire to set forth certain
understandings between the Company and Investcorp, including with respect to
certain governance matters.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  



  

Each party hereby represents and warrants to the other party and acknowledges
that: (a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been
duly authorized by such party and do not require such party to obtain any
consent or approval that has not been obtained and do not contravene or
result in a default under any provision of any law or regulation applicable to
such party or other governing documents or any agreement or instrument to
which such party is a party or by which such party is bound; (b) such party
has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder; and (c) this Agreement is valid, binding and
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Remedies Exceptions (as such term is defined in the Business Combination
Agreement).

  



  

Article II

  



  

BOARD OF DIRECTORS; VOTING

  



  

Section 2.1 _Board Composition_. As of the date hereof, one of the
members of the Board1 shall be a representative nominated or appointed by
Investcorp on behalf of the Investcorp Group (the " _Investcorp Director_
"). The Investcorp Director shall be a Class III Director pursuant to the
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company.

  



  



    | 1| Note  to Draft: The parties to revisit, prior to the closing
date, if the ownership stake  of the Investcorp Group at closing, when
combined with the size of the Pensare board,  yields proportional board
representation of a greater number of board seats. 
---|---|--- 
 



  

   



 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Vacancies_. To the extent not inconsistent with
Section 141(k) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
Company's Governing Documents, during the initial term of the Class III
Directors of approximately three (3) years following the date hereof (the "
_Initial Term_ "), for so long as the Investcorp Group beneficially owns or
holds a number of shares of Common Stock representing at least 5% of the
outstanding Common Stock, Investcorp shall have the exclusive right to
nominate for election to the Board directors to fill any vacancy created by
reason of death, removal or resignation of the Investcorp Director during the
Initial Term, and the Board and Investcorp shall take all Necessary Action to
cause any such vacancy to be filled by a replacement director nominated by
Investcorp during the Initial Term as promptly as reasonably practicable. For
the avoidance of doubt, Investcorp shall have no right to nominate or appoint
any director to the Board upon the expiration of the Initial Term of the
Class III Directors following the date hereof.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Board Meeting Expenses_. The Company shall pay all
reasonable reimbursable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, travel and lodging) incurred by the Investcorp Director in the
course of his or her service hereunder, including in connection with
attending regular and special meetings of the Board, any board of directors or
board of managers of each of the Company's Subsidiaries and/or any of their
respective committees, in each case in accordance with the Company's policies
applicable to directors generally as in effect from time to time.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall obtain customary director and officer
indemnity insurance on reasonable terms for so long as the Investcorp
Director serves on the Board, and upon removal or resignation of any
Investcorp Director for any reason, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to extend such director and officer indemnity
insurance coverage for a period of not less than six years from the date of
any such event in respect of any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the date of such event. For so long as the Investcorp Director serves on the
Board, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to not allow any
amendment, alteration or repeal of any right to indemnification or
exculpation covering or benefiting any Investcorp Director to the
extent consistent with applicable law (except to the extent such amendment,
alteration or repeal permits the Company to provide broader or more favorable
indemnification or exculpation rights).

  



  

(b) The Company hereby acknowledges that any director, officer or
other indemnified person covered by any such indemnity insurance policy (any
such Person, an " _Indemnitee_ ") may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by Investcorp or one or
more of its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Fund Indemnitors_"). The
Company hereby: (a) agrees that the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that
provides indemnification shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its
or their obligations to an Indemnitee shall be primary and any obligation of
any Fund Indemnitor to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by an Indemnitee shall be
secondary); (b) agrees that it shall be required to advance the full amount
of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount
of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to
the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement
or any other agreement between the Company and an Indemnitee, without regard
to any rights an Indemnitee may have against any Fund Indemnitor or its
insurers; and (c) irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Fund
Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Fund Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by the Fund
Indemnitors on behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which
such Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect
the foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of
the rights of recovery of such Indemnitee against the Company.

Section 2.5 _Corporate Opportunity_. The doctrine of corporate
opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to
the Investcorp Director or any Exempted Person (as defined below), and to the
extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Investcorp
Director, Investcorp and the investment funds affiliated with or managed by
Investcorp and their respective successors and affiliates (other than the
Corporation and its subsidiaries) and all of their respective partners,
principals, directors, officers, members, managers, equity holders and/or
employees, including any of the foregoing who serve as officers or directors
of the Company (each, an " _Exempted Person_ ") shall not have any fiduciary
duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar
business activities or lines of business as the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, except as otherwise expressly provided in any agreement entered
into between the Company and such Exempted Person. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Company, on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company and its
subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in,
business opportunities that are from time to time available to the Exempted
Persons, even if the opportunity is one that the Company or its subsidiaries
might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to
pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and each such Exempted Person
shall have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to the
Company (and there shall be no restriction on the Exempted Persons using the
general knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the Company
operates which it has gained as an Exempted Person in considering and
pursuing such opportunities or in making investment, voting, monitoring,
governance or other decisions relating to other entities or securities) and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be liable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders for breach of any
fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of
the fact that such Exempted Person pursues or acquires such business
opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to
present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business
opportunity, to the Company or its subsidiaries, or uses such knowledge
and understanding in the manner described herein, in each case, except as
otherwise expressly provided in any agreement entered into between the
Company and such Exempted Person. In addition to and notwithstanding the
foregoing, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to belong to the
Company if it is a business opportunity that the Company is not financially
able or contractually permitted or legally able to undertake, or that is,
from its nature, not in the line of the Company's business or is of no
practical advantage to it or that is one in which the Company has no interest
or reasonable expectancy.

Section 3.1 _Quarterly Financial Statements_. Concurrently with
the distribution of the Company's quarterly financial statements to the

this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Investcorp an unaudited balance
sheet of the Company as of the last day of each of the first three fiscal
quarters of each fiscal year and the related unaudited consolidated statements

Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Investcorp an audited balance sheet of
the Company as of the end of such fiscal year and the related audited

and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to, the Company), at
reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company, to review
the books, records, contracts and agreements of the Company or any of such
Subsidiaries and to discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the Company
or any of such Subsidiaries with the officers of the Company or any such
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
pursuant to this Section 3.3 to provide access to any information if and to
the extent that it reasonably and in good faith believes that the disclosure
of such information would adversely affect the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Confidentiality_. The Company's obligations under
this Article III are subject to Investcorp entering into a customary
confidentiality agreement with the Company, in form and substance reasonably

addition, Investcorp acknowledges that certain of the Company's securities are
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and that certain
of the Company's securities are publicly traded. Accordingly, without
limiting any of Investcorp's other obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement, Investcorp agrees that so long as it possesses information about
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is "material non-public information" ("
_MNPI_ ") for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including
Regulation FD, Investcorp shall comply with the applicable securities laws
governing use of MNPI.
