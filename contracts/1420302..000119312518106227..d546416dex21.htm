NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, subject to and upon the

Section 1.2 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place as promptly as practicable, but
no later than three (3) Business Days, following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 1000
Winter Street, Suite 3700, Waltham, MA 02451 (or remotely via the exchange of
documents and signatures), unless another place or date is agreed to in
writing by the Parties. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein

effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or upon the later effective time specified in
the Certificate of Merger so filed (the "Effective Time").

 

Section 1.3 Effect on Company Capital Stock.

 

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Company Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party hereto or any Company Equityholders, each share of Company Capital
Stock that is held in the treasury of the Company shall be cancelled and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party hereto
or any Company Stockholders, each share of Company Capital Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Capital Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section
1.3(a) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive, (i) an amount in cash equal to the
Applicable Per Share Closing Merger Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the Pro Rata
Percentage of the Adjustment Amount, if any, for distribution to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.6(c)(i), _plus_ (iii) the Pro Rata
Percentage of any amount released from the Escrow Fund for distribution
to the Company

 



-2-  Stockholders in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Section 1.7, _plus_
(iv) the Pro Rata Percentage of any amount released from the Representative
Reserve Fund for distribution to the Company Stockholders in accordance with
Section 1.8(f). Any amount of cash payable to a holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent at the time of payment. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will cease to be, and will have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, other than in
the case of shares of Company Capital Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares), the
right to receive the cash payments in accordance with this Section 1.3(b).

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and each stock certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.4 Effect on Company Options and Company Warrants.

 

(a) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option
with an exercise price less than the Applicable Per Share Total Merger
Consideration applicable to the Company Common Stock, whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time and to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive,
an amount in cash, equal to the Applicable Per Share Total Merger
Consideration applicable to the Company Common Stock multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the entire
portion of the Company Option (vested and unvested), _minus_ the exercise
price of the Company Option multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the entire portion of the Company
Option (vested and unvested) (the "Option Closing Payout Amount"). The portion
of each Company Option, if any, with an exercise price greater than or equal
to the Applicable Per Share Total Merger Consideration applicable to the
Company Common Stock shall be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time,
by virtue of this Agreement and without any further action on the part of
Buyer and without any payment from Buyer thereon. 

(ii) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take or cause to be
taken all actions (including adopting all resolutions, providing notices and
procuring consents (after review and approval by Buyer of the forms thereof,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) that are
required under the Company Option Plan, applicable Law or this Agreement, or
are otherwise reasonably necessary to

 



-3-  effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.4(a) and to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Option cancelled or substituted as provided in this Section 1.4(a) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (if any) specified in and subject to the terms of this
Section 1.4(a), without interest.

 

(b) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant with
an exercise price less than the Applicable Per Share Total Merger
Consideration applicable to the Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive, an amount in cash equal to
Applicable Per Share Total Merger Consideration applicable to the Company
Common Stock multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the portion of the Company Warrant that is vested as
of the Closing, _minus_ the exercise price of the Company Warrant multiplied
by the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
portion of the Company Warrant that is vested as of the Closing. Each Company
Warrant with an exercise price greater than or equal to the Applicable Per
Share Total Merger Consideration applicable to the Company Common Stock and
each Company Warrant (or portion thereof) that is unvested at the Effective
Time shall be cancelled automatically at the Effective Time without any
payment from Buyer thereon.

 

Section 1.5 Closing Payments; Closing Payment Schedule.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer will make, or cause to be made, the

(i) the name and address of each Company Equityholder immediately prior to
the Closing;

 

(ii) the shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company
Warrants held by each Company Equityholder immediately prior to the Closing
(including, with respect to the Company Options and Company Warrants, the
exercise price and the portion vested and unvested as of the Closing);

 

(iii) the Companys calculation of the Total Merger Consideration
(including Estimated Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses and Estimated Net Working Capital and each item thereof);

 

(iv) with respect to each Company Equityholder, the portion of the Total
Merger Consideration to be allocated to such Company Equityholder pursuant to
Sections 1.3 and 1.4;

(v) the Pro Rata Percentage of each Company Stockholder and the Joining
Company Stockholder Pro Rata Percentage of each Joining Company Stockholder;

 

(vi) the amount to be contributed on behalf of each Company Stockholder to
the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 1.7 and to the Representative Reserve
Fund pursuant to Section 1.8(f); and

 

(vii) the wire instructions or other payment information for each Closing
Date Payee and each item of Closing Indebtedness to be paid at the Closing,

Section 5.1 and Asset Purchase Fees.

 

The Closing Payment Schedule shall be subject to approval by the Buyer and
shall be prepared and determined in accordance with the same methods,
policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications as were
used in the preparation of the Closing Payment Schedule Trial Run. The Company
shall give the Buyer timely access to all supporting workpapers used in
the preparation of the Closing Payment Schedule, which Closing Payment
Schedule, when in form and substance satisfactory to and approved by the
Buyer, shall be deemed the definitive calculation of the Merger Consideration
payable to the Company Equityholders in connection with the Merger and the
disbursement thereof. The Buyer shall be entitled to rely entirely on the
Closing Payment Schedule in connection with distributing the Merger
Consideration and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, neither the
Representative nor any Company Equityholder shall be entitled to make any
claim in respect of the allocation of the Merger Consideration made by the
Buyer to or for the benefit of any Company Equityholder to the extent the
Merger Consideration was distributed in a manner consistent with the Closing
Payment Schedule.

 



-5- Section 1.6 Merger Consideration Adjustment.

 

(a) _Preliminary Statement_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a reasonably detailed statement
(the "Preliminary Statement") setting forth, along with the related
calculations (and including each line item of Current Assets and Current
Liabilities as is set forth on the Reference Statement), the Companys good
faith estimate of Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"),
the Companys good faith estimate of Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (such
estimate, the "Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses"), and the
Companys good faith estimate of Closing Net Working Capital (including each
line item thereof) (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). The Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and
Estimated Net Working Capital amounts set forth on the Preliminary Statement
shall be conclusive for the purposes of calculating the Total Merger
Consideration to be paid at Closing, but the Final Closing Indebtedness,
Final Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and Final Net Working Capital and
any resulting adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration contemplated by
Section 1.6(c) shall be determined in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1.6(b). The Preliminary Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including Section 1.6(d).

 

(b) _Closing Statement_.

 

(i) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Representative a reasonably detailed statement
(the "Closing Statement") setting forth, along with the related calculations,
Buyers good faith determination of the actual amount of Closing Indebtedness,
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and Closing Net Working Capital, together
with copies of such documentation used in the calculations thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Representative to allow the Representative to
review such calculations and the related adjustments to the Total Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 1.6(c). The Closing Statement and the
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, including Section 1.6(d).

(ii) Within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by
the Representative of the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver
written notice (an "Objection Notice") to Buyer of all disputes, if any, the
Representative may have with respect to the preparation of the Closing
Statement, which Objection Notice shall specify those amounts, determinations
or calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that the Representative
disputes and shall set forth the Representatives proposed adjustment to each
such disputed amount, determination or calculation. If the Representative
does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect to the Closing
Statement within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Closing Statement
(including each amount, determination and calculation contained therein) will
be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If an Objection
Notice is timely delivered within such thirty (30) calendar day period, Buyer
and the Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve
each dispute raised therein (each, an "Objection") and all other amounts,
determinations and calculations in the Closing Statement shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. All Objections that are so resolved in
writing between the parties shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties.

 



-6- (iii) The parties hereto agree that:

 

(A) If Buyer and the Representative fail to resolve all Objections within
thirty (30) calendar days after the Representative delivers an Objection
Notice, then Buyer and the Representative shall jointly, and as promptly as
practicable, engage an Accounting Firm (acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator) to resolve, in accordance with this Agreement (including Section
1.6(d)), only those Objections that remain in dispute (the "Objection Items").
The terms of engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as mutually agreed
upon between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand. Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm in
all reasonable respects, but no party hereto will have _ex parte_ meetings,
teleconferences or other correspondence with the Accounting Firm.

(B) Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to, as promptly as practicable following the
engagement of the Accounting Firm (but in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days following such engagement), deliver to Buyer and the
Representative a written determination (such determination to include a
worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination, and such determination to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer and the Representative and not
by independent review or development) of each Objection Item, which
determination (i) shall be within the range of disputes between the Closing
Statement and the Objection Notice, such that the Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any Objection Item greater than the greatest value for such
Objection Item claimed by any party hereto or less than the smallest value for
such Objection Item claimed by any party hereto; (ii) shall be made strictly
in accordance with the accounting procedures set forth in this Agreement
(including 1.6(d)) without exception; and (iii) shall be (1) the exclusive
remedy of the parties with respect to any disputes arising with respect to the
calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or any adjustment to the Total
Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 1.6(c), and (2) final, conclusive
and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered on such determination
of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced.

(C) The Accounting Firm shall only make determinations with respect to the
Objection Items, provided, that the scope of the disputes to be resolved by
the Accounting Firm shall in all cases be limited to whether the Closing
Statement and the amounts, calculations and determinations therein were
prepared and performed in accordance with this Agreement (including Section
1.6(d)) and whether there were mathematical errors contained in such
statements, calculations or determinations, and the Accounting Firm is not
authorized or permitted to make any other determination.

(D) The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to
this Section 1.6 shall be borne by the Company Stockholders by taking such
amounts from the Representative Reserve Fund, on the one hand, and by Buyer,
on the 

 



-7-  other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of Objection
Items so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is successfully disputed by
such party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total
amount of such Objection Items so submitted by such party.

 

(c) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount (as defined below) is a positive number, then
the Merger Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders shall be
increased by the Adjustment Amount, and if the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then the Merger Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders
shall be decreased by the Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, then, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which
the Adjustment Amount is finally and conclusively determined in accordance
with this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Escrow Agent, to be held in the Primary Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, cash constituting an amount equal to such
Adjustment Amount.

 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then, within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which the Adjustment Amount is finally and
conclusively determined in accordance with this Agreement, the parties shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Buyer a portion of the Primary Escrow Fund equal to such
Adjustment Amount.

(iii) Any payment made pursuant to Section 1.6(c) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes
and shall be treated as such by the Parties on their Tax Returns to the
fullest extent permitted by Law.

 

(iv) "Adjustment Amount" means the net amount (as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 1.6), which may be positive or negative, equal
to:

(A) (1) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (2) the Final Closing
Indebtedness; _plus_ __

(B) (1) the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (2) the
Final Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses; _plus_ __

 

(C) (1) the Final Net Working Capital, _minus_ (2) the Estimated Net
Working Capital. 

(d) _Accounting Procedures_. _Exhibit E_ sets forth a statement (the
"Reference Statement") prepared in good faith by the Company in cooperation
with Buyer setting forth the various line items used (or to be used) in, and
illustrating as of December 31, 2017, the calculation of (i) Current
Assets, (ii) Current Liabilities, (iii) Closing Indebtedness, (iv) Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses and (v) Net Working Capital, in each case
prepared and calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the Agreed
Accounting Policies and Principles. For all purposes hereunder, the
Preliminary Statement and Closing Statement and all determinations and

 



-8-  calculations by any Person (including without limitation the Accounting
Firm) of Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Closing Indebtedness, Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital Amount shall in all
Circumstances be prepared and calculated strictly in accordance with the
manner of determination and calculation (as applicable) as shown on the
Reference Statement using the same line items, accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent
classifications, elections, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and
estimation methodologies) used and applied in preparing the Reference
Statement without deviation or exception in any manner, or for any reason,
whatsoever; _provided_ , that such calculations and determinations: (i) shall
not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a
daily (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month.

Section 1.7 Escrow. At the Closing, the Representative, Buyer and
the Escrow Agent shall execute the Escrow Agreement. An amount in cash equal
to $30,000,000 (the "Primary Escrow Amount"), an amount in cash equal to
$5,000,000 (the "First Special Escrow Amount") and an amount in cash equal to
$15,000,000 (the "Second Special Escrow Amount" and, together with the Primary
Escrow Amount and the First Special Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Amount") shall
be withheld from the Total Merger Consideration payable to, and therefore
shall not be paid to, the Company Stockholders at the Closing (each such
withholding to be made on a Pro Rata Percentage with respect to each Company
Stockholder) but instead shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held by
the Escrow Agent in three separate dedicated escrow accounts (the "Primary
Escrow Fund," the "First Special Escrow Fund" and the "Second Special Escrow
Fund," respectively, and together the "Escrow Fund") and shall be disbursed
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The
Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any
other judicial process of any creditor of any Person, and shall be held and
disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. In the event an amount is released to the Company
Stockholder from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to an amount equal to
such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage of such amount, as determined
at the time by the Representative in accordance with this Agreement.

hereby, including any actions that the Representative may, in its sole

Representative Engagement Agreement and for purposes of clarity, other than as

(c) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any

Stockholder and such Company Stockholders successors; and Buyer, each
Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as
being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,

(i) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Representative shall be

the fullest extent permitted by Law, no Joining Company Stockholders shall
have any cause of action against the Representative for any action taken,
decision made or instruction given by the Representative in connection with
this Agreement, the Representative Engagement Agreement or the agreements
ancillary hereto, except for fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the
Representative;

 

(ii) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the provisions of this Section
1.8 and the powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Representative

 



-11-  Group hereunder: (i) are independent and severable, are irrevocable and
coupled with an interest, and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights
or remedies that any Joining Company Stockholder may have in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) shall survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Joining Company
Stockholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (iii) shall
survive the delivery of an assignment by any Joining Company Stockholder of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund;

 

(iii) no Joining Company Stockholder shall have any cause of action against
the Representative for any action taken or not taken, any decision made or
any instruction given or not given by the Representative under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Representative Engagement Agreement and the
agreements and instruments contemplated hereby and thereby, except for causes
of action for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement by the Representative or the Representatives gross negligence or
willful misconduct;

 

(iv) remedies available at Law for any breach of the provisions of this
Section 1.8 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer shall be entitled to

damages if the Buyer brings an action to enforce the provisions of this
Section 1.8;

 

(v) the Representative shall be entitled to: (i) reasonably rely upon the

the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 

(e) The Joining Company Stockholder and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
the Representative can resign upon thirty (30) days written notice to the
Advisory Group and may be removed and/or replaced at any time upon the
affirmative written consent of Joining Company Stockholders holding a majority
of the aggregate Pro Rata Percentage of all Joining Company Stockholders.
Upon the due removal and/or replacement of the Representative, Buyer and the
newly appointed Representative shall provide prompt written notice to the
Escrow Agent concerning such replacement.

 

(f) At the Closing, an amount in cash equal to $350,000 (the
"Representative Reserve Fund") shall be withheld from the Total Merger
Consideration payable to, and therefore shall not be paid to, the Company
Stockholders at the Closing (each such withholding to be made on a Pro Rata
Percentage with respect to each Company Stockholder), but instead shall be
delivered to the Representative to be held by the Representative in a
dedicated account for the payment of any Representative Losses or other
expenses incurred by the Representative in

 



-12-  performing the duties assigned to the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative Engagement Agreement.
The Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Representative Reserve
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes
and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. The Representative Reserve Fund shall be used by the
Representative solely to pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
actually incurred by or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Representative in connection with the acceptance, performance and
administration of its duties as the Representative pursuant to this Agreement.
Any remaining balance in the Representative Reserve Fund shall be released by
the Representative to the Company Stockholders (or to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Company Stockholders) at such time as the
Representative determines that the Representative Reserve Fund is no longer
necessary or desirable, and each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to an
amount equal to such Company Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage of such amount
so released. Prior to any such release of the Representative Reserve Fund, the
Representative shall deliver to Buyer an updated Closing Payment Schedule
setting forth the portion of the Representative Reserve Fund payable to each
Company Stockholder.

 

(g) Certain Company Stockholders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the "Representative Engagement Agreement") with the Representative (such
Company Stockholders, including their individual representatives,
collectively, the "Advisory Group"). As between the Company Stockholders and
the Representative, neither the Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the "Representative Group") shall be liable for
any act done or omitted in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Representative Engagement Agreement or the agreements ancillary
hereto while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted to be done
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith. The Company Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Representative Group from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs, judgments and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement, the Representative Engagement Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
fraud or willful misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will
reimburse the Company Stockholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such fraud or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative by the Company
Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the
Representative from the Representative Reserve Fund; _provided_ , that while
this section allows the Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company Stockholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no

 



-13-  event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability on behalf of the Company Stockholders
or otherwise. Furthermore, the Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless the Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities (including the Representative Reserve Fund), which, in its
reasonable determination, are sufficient to protect the Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Representative in performing such actions. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities and immunities will survive the Closing, the resignation or
removal of the Representative or any member of the Advisory Group or the
termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 1.9 Paying Agent; Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall
engage Acquiom Financial LLC or another paying agent (such Person, together

presented to the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Paying Agent, the
Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for in Section 1.3 in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 1.9(b)(i). Any payment to be made by the Paying Agent to any
Person pursuant to this Section 1.9(b)(i) shall be made by wire transfer of

this Agreement on the Closing Date.

 

(ii) _Company Options_. The Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall pay,
or cause the Paying Agent to pay, to each holder of a Company Option, in
exchange therefor, the portion of the Total Merger Consideration to which they

made by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to any Person who is, or at
the relevant time, was an employee of the Company pursuant to this Section
1.9(b)(ii) shall be made via a specially scheduled payroll of the Surviving
Corporation to be completed not less than three (3) Business Days following

accordance with this Section 1.9(b)(i) or Company Options in accordance with
Section 1.9(b)(ii) or Company Warrants in accordance with Section 1.9(b)(iii)
prior to that time

 



-15-  shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and/or Buyer, as
general creditors thereof, for payment of their claim for cash, without
interest, to which such holders may be entitled subject to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If the requisite documents
required pursuant to Section 1.9(b) have not been surrendered immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity, any such portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by the Company Equityholders immediately prior to
such time shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Paying Agent
or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any Company Equityholder with respect
to any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 1.10 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL,
any share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which is held by a Company Stockholder who did
not consent to or vote in favor of the Merger who otherwise complies with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (such share being a "Dissenting
Share," and such Company Stockholder being a "Dissenting Stockholder"), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which
the holder of such share would be entitled pursuant to Section 1.3 but rather
shall be converted into the right to receive such amount as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders
dissenters rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and each such shares
thereafter shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration referred to in Section
1.3, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 1.9.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Merger is abandoned, then the right of a stockholder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Buyer (a) notice of any demand for
payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Capital Stock or any
attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and any other instrument
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to any
stockholders appraisal rights and (b) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
payment under the DGCL. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demand for appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares
without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

Section 1.11 Withholding Obligations. Each of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (or any other
document referred to herein) to any Person such amounts as it reasonably
determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement (and each other

deduction and withholding was made. The Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, and the Paying Agent shall also have
the right to collect IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, or such other forms relating to
United States federal withholding obligations as may be applicable, from such
Persons. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any amounts are required to
be so withheld from any distributions from the Escrow Fund, such amounts
required to be withheld may be distributed to the Buyer (or an
entity designated by the Buyer) to enable the Buyer (or any such designated
entity) to comply with its withholding obligations (including, without
limitation, any obligations of the Company or the Surviving Corporation).

property in any jurisdiction (i) in which a material amount of Tax is imposed,

the engagement of said current or former employee, director or independent
contractor with the Company.

(n) The Customer Offerings are, in all material respects, free from

malicious code in the past three (3) years. The Company has not received any
written warranty claims, contractual terminations or requests for settlement
or refund where the stated reason for the written claim, termination or

damage to any Person except as set forth in Section 2.14(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

reasonable basis therefor, in each case relating to (i) any actual or alleged
violation of the Companys current or former privacy policies or any Persons
privacy, personal, or confidentiality rights thereunder, or (ii) any actual
or alleged violation of any Laws relating to the Companys collection,

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either

former employee or former service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries

otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any

officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Person
who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company would reasonably be

(a) The Company shall take all necessary action such that all amounts due
and payable or that may become due and payable (including notice periods,
repatriation commitments, severance, bonuses and sales commissions) with
respect to any employee, independent contractor or consultant whose
relationship with the Company and its Subsidiaries has terminated or expired
prior to the Closing shall have been paid in full by the Company such that the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Buyer shall have no obligations to any such
Person as of and after the Closing.

 

(b) Through December 31, 2018, the Buyer shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
employed after the Closing Date (the "Continuing Employees") while they remain
employed: (i) annual base compensation that is no less favorable than that in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) cash bonus
opportunities and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the cash bonus opportunities and employee benefits in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date or not less favorable than the cash
bonus opportunities and employee benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of the Buyer and its subsidiaries; _provided_ , that no equity
awards, change in control and transaction-based bonus plans, arrangements or
agreements or payments pursuant to Bonus Letters under Section 5.13 shall be
taken into account in determining whether the covenants in this Section 5.9(b)
have been satisfied.

 

(c) Each Continuing Employee will receive service credit for all periods of
employment with the Company, any Subsidiary or any predecessor thereof prior
to the Closing for purposes of entitlement to benefits under vacation or paid
time off policies and eligibility and vesting (other than for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical
plans, non-qualified deferred compensation or similar plans or arrangements or
where such credit would result in duplication of benefits for the same period
of service) under other employee benefit plans or programs maintained by
Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer in which the Continuing Employee participates
(the "Buyer Plans"), to the same extent and for the same purposes as such
service was recognized under any analogous Company Benefit Plan in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. For Buyer Plans providing medical, dental or
vision benefits in which a Continuing Employee becomes covered after the
Closing, Buyer shall or cause its applicable Subsidiary to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions (or actively at work or similar limitations), evidence of
insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation,
and (ii) give effect for the plan year in which the Closing occurs in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-

 



-56-  pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, the Continuing Employees under analogous Company Benefit Plans,
for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, subject to receipt by the
Company or its insurer of all reasonably requested documentation with respect
thereto.

 

(d) At the request of the Buyer, to be made at least five (5) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries (as applicable) will
provide notice on the Closing Date to the applicable benefit plan
administrator(s) and service provider(s) as is necessary to terminate any and
all Company Benefit Plans effective on the earliest practicable date after
the Closing Date without additional payments, fees, costs or penalties (other
than routine administrative fees) and will provide the Buyer with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer that such termination notice has been duly
delivered and such termination has been authorized pursuant to resolutions
duly adopted by the Company Board of Directors or the board of directors of a
Subsidiary, as applicable. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Company Benefit Plans as the Buyer may
reasonably require in furtherance of this Section 5.9(d).

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall confer third-party beneficiary rights
to any Person other than the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, the Buyer or its subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates to
terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of such employees, independent
contractors or consultants or guarantee employment for any period of time,
subject to any obligations under applicable Law. In addition, no provision of
this Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to amend any term or
condition of any Buyer Plans or the Company Benefit Plans or any other
employee related plan, program or policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
the Buyer or its subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates, or to prohibit or
limit the ability of the Company of its Subsidiaries, the Buyer or its
subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements.

 

Section 5.10 Section 280G Approval. The Company shall, as promptly as is
practicable after entering into this Agreement and in any event prior to the
Closing Date, submit for approval by the Company Stockholders by the requisite
vote (and in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) any payments or
benefits that could reasonably be expected to constitute a "parachute
payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code payable to such individuals that
have executed such waivers referenced below (the "280G Payments"), such that
all such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or shall be exempt from such treatment
under such Section 280G, and deliver to the Buyer evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer that a vote of the Company Stockholders was
received in conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder (the "280G Approval"), or that such requisite shareholder approval
has not been obtained with respect to any such 280G Payments and as a
consequence, that such payments shall not be made or provided. All documents
to be delivered to the Company Stockholders in connection with such vote and
any required disqualified individual waivers or consents will be subject to
the Buyers prior review and approval, which documents will be delivered to
the Buyer within a reasonable period of time in advance and which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Buyer and its
counsel shall be provided copies of all documents executed by the Company
Stockholders and disqualified individuals in connection with the vote provided
under this Section 5.10.

 



-57- Section 5.11 Termination of Investor Agreements. The Company shall take,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to take, all such steps as may be
necessary to terminate, as of the Closing, all investor rights granted by the
Company to the Company Stockholders and in effect prior to the Closing,
including rights of co-sale, voting, registration, first refusal, board
observation or information or operational covenants, and all indemnification
agreements entered into with directors of the Company.

 

Section 5.12 Insurance. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement, or "tail," under the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer (the "DandO Tail Policy") that shall provide
the members of the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys officers
with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the
insured persons than the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.

 

Section 5.13 [Reserved.]

 

Section 5.14 Retention Bonus Payments. No later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver and offer to enter into a bonus
letter in the form of _Exhibit I_ (each, a "Bonus Letter") with each of those
individuals that are mutually agreed upon the Buyer and the Company (the
"Retention Bonus Recipients"). The Bonus Letters collectively shall provide
for the payment of an aggregate of $15,000,000 (the "Retention Cash Pool"),
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Bonus Letters. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Retention Cash Pool shall be funded solely by the
Buyer in addition to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 5.15 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. All rights to
indemnification by the Company and its Subsidiaries existing in favor of
those Persons who are directors and officers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (the "DandO Indemnified Persons")
for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the Organizational Documents or the Subsidiary Organizational
Documents (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in
the indemnification agreements between the Company or its
Subsidiaries disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule and such DandO Indemnified
Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), shall survive the
Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to the fullest extent available under applicable Law, and any claim made
requesting indemnification pursuant to such indemnification rights shall
continue to be subject to this Section 5.15 and the indemnification rights
provided under this Section 5.15 until disposition of such claim. To the
extent the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries do not indemnify the DandO
Indemnified Persons as provided above, the Buyer shall so indemnify the DandO
Indemnified Persons on behalf of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.15 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and
their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such DandO Indemnified Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section
5.15 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without
the prior written consent of the affected DandO Indemnified Person.

 



-58- Section 5.16 Company Indebtedness; Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses. At
the Closing, the Buyer shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, pay or cause to be
paid, in accordance with the instructions from the Company on the Closing
Payment Schedule, the amounts of (a) Closing Indebtedness (other than
with respect to clause (ix) of the definition of "Indebtedness") to the
holders thereof and (b) Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses to the payees
thereof.

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1 Tax Filings.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company that are
required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the
Closing Date, and the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the
Company due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as required by
applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (taking
into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns, the Company
shall deliver a draft of such Tax Returns to the Buyer for the Buyers review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(b) The Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared
and filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company that relate to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date but that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date (taking into account any extension). At least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date (taking into account any extension) for the
filing of such Tax Returns, the Buyer shall deliver a draft of such Tax
Returns to the Representative for the Representatives review and shall make
such reasonable changes to such Tax Returns that the Representative shall
request. The Parties shall treat the taxable year of the Company as ending on
the Closing Date where required or allowable by Law and shall allocate income
to the period ending on the Closing Date based on a closing of the books as of
the Closing Date.

(c) Subject to the first and second sentences of Section 6.1(b) above, the
Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, any Tax Return (a "Straddle Period Tax Return") required to be filed by
the Company for a Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by
treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Company with respect to such items, except as required by
applicable Law. The Buyer shall deliver, at least ten (10) days prior to the
due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of such Straddle
Period Tax Return a draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return, to the
Representative and shall consider in good faith the changes to such Tax Return
that the Representative shall reasonably request. The portion of any Tax that
is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be: (i) in the case of real,
personal and intangible property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such
Straddle

 



-59-  Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

 

(d) For the avoidance of any doubt, all deductions and other income tax
benefits related to the payment or accruals of Company expenses related to
the Transactions, cancellation of Options and Option payments or other Company
expenses related to the consummation of transactions set forth in this
Agreement shall (i) be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) be
claimed as current deductions or benefits on the Companys Tax Returns for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, including through the filing of a safe harbor
election pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2011-29 with respect to success-based
fees, in each case, to the extent permitted by Law (as determined on a "more
likely than not basis" by a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm).

Section 6.2 Cooperation. The Buyer, the Representative and the Company
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes of
the Company, including access to books and records, as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by the Buyer, the Representative
or the Company, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation
for any audit by any Governmental Entity and the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. The Buyer, the
Representative and the Company agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Entity.

 

Section 6.3 Transfer Taxes. All sales, recording, transfer, valued added,
documentary, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Closing and the
Transactions shall be split 50-50 by the Company Stockholders and the Buyer,
and the Company Stockholders will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if
required by applicable Law, the Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation to the
extent required by applicable Law.

 

Section 6.4 Tax Contests.

 

(a) The Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Company
Stockholders, the Representative and their Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice
of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect
to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such inquiry, claim,
assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax Matter"). Any failure to so notify
the other party of any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any
liability with respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party
was actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) The Representative may, at the Company Stockholders expense,
participate in and, upon written notice to the Buyer, assume the defense of
any Tax Matter relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Company
Stockholders have an indemnification

 



-60-  obligation pursuant to this Agreement (a "Pre-Closing Tax Matter"). If the
Representative assumes such defense, the Representative shall have the
authority, with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, to represent the
interests of the Company before the relevant Taxing authority and have the
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of such Tax
Matter subject to the limitations contained herein, including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, such Pre-Closing Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Representative (x) shall not enter into any settlement of, or otherwise
compromise, any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (y) shall keep Buyer informed with respect to the commencement,
status, and progress of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter controlled by the
Representative, and (z) will consult with Buyer with respect to such Pre-
Closing Tax Matter and reflect any reasonable comments by Buyer regarding the
conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

 

(c) With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Matter for which the Representative
has not assumed such defense, Buyer shall have the authority to represent the
interests of the Company before the relevant Taxing authority and have the
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of such Pre-
Closing Tax Matter subject to the limitations contained herein, including
responding to inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any
assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Pre-Closing Tax Matter;
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer (x) shall not enter into any settlement of, or
otherwise compromise, any such Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), if such settlement or compromise would cause the
Company Stockholders to be liable for any part of the settlement amount to be
paid with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Matter or otherwise increase the
Company Stockholders liability for Taxes under this Agreement, (y) shall keep
the Representative informed with respect to the commencement, status, and
progress of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter controlled, and (z) will consult
with the Representative with respect to such Tax Matter and reflect any
reasonable comments by the Representative regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such proceeding.

 

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Representative, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Buyer shall not, and
shall not cause or permit Company or its Affiliates, to (i) make, change or
revoke any Tax election that has any retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) amend or cause to be amended any
Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or amend or cause to be
amended (or file any election or take any other action with respect to) any
return, declaration, report or other filing relating to any telecommunications
fees (including payment to federal and state universal service funds) filed
by the Company prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) initiate any contact
(including through any voluntary disclosure program or filing of a Tax Return
that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period inconsistent with past practice) with
any Governmental Entity in respect of Taxes or Tax Returns that relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



-61- (e) The Buyer shall pay to the Company Stockholders by delivering to
the Escrow Agent for inclusion in the Escrow Fund (or, if no amounts are
otherwise remaining in the Escrow Fund, by delivering to the Representative to
be held in the Representative Reserve Fund) any refund or credit of any Tax
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by the Company in cash or
by way of set-off against current Tax but excluding any such refund that (i)
arises as a result of the carry back of losses or tax attributes from a
period following the Closing and (ii) any customer-related government grants
(including the California Teleconnect Fund and E-Rate) and business incentive
credits (including Scientific Research Experimental Development (SRandED) and
eBusiness) or other similar items (any such amount a "Tax Refund"). The Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Representive in
writing of the receipt of any Tax Refund by a Tax authority. Any amount
payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be due
and payable within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of the Tax Refund,
net of any costs or expenses (including Taxes) incurred in obtaining such Tax
Refund. If the Buyer makes or causes to be made any payment of a Tax Refund
and such Tax Refund is subsequently denied or disallowed, the Company
Stockholders shall promptly pay the amount of such denied or disallowed Tax
Refund (including any interest and penalties thereon) to the Buyer within ten
(10) Business Days upon request by the Buyer.

 

(f) Neither the Buyer nor the Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall, in connection with the Merger, make or cause to be made any
actual or deemed election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the Code, or any
corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign laws. Neither the Buyer,
the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall take any action which
would waive or relinquish the right of the Company to carry back net
operating losses generated by the Company in Pre-Closing Tax Periods to prior
Tax years.

 

(g) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
Section 6.4 and Article VIII, the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall
control.

Section 6.5 Certain Foreign Subsidiary Matters. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 6.5, no party to this Agreement shall make or permit
to be made any election relating to the utilization of net operating losses or
other tax attributes, or any election to defer the payment of tax, in each
case under Code Section 965, without the advance written consent of Buyer and
the Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the Representative shall be permitted (without the consent of Buyer) to take
actions as may be necessary so that any of the Companys NOLs or other tax
attributes are available to be and are applied against amounts includible in
income under Code Section 965\.

Section 8.3 Indemnification Claims.

 

(a) _Notice_. As soon as reasonably practicable after any Indemnified
Party becomes aware of any claim that has resulted in or is reasonably
anticipated to result in Damages that any such Indemnified Party has under
this Article VIII against one or more Indemnifying Party, which term includes
all Indemnifying Parties if more than one, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Party) a
certificate signed by any officer of the Indemnified Party (a "Claim Notice"):

 



-71- (i) stating that the Indemnified Party has incurred, paid or properly
accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay or properly accrue,
Damages;

 

(ii) stating the amount of such Damages (which, in the case of Damages not
yet incurred, paid or properly accrued, may be the maximum amount in good
faith anticipated to be incurred, paid or properly accrued, if ascertainable);
and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by the Indemnified Party) the individual items of such Damages
included in the amount so stated (if ascertainable), the nature of the claim
to which such Damages are related, and copies of any material supporting
documentation.

 

(b) _Delay_. No delay in or failure to give a Claim Notice by an
Indemnified Party to the Representative pursuant to this Section 8.3 will
adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the Indemnified
Party has under this Agreement, except and to the extent that such delay or
failure has actually materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

(c) _Objections to Claims_. The Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party) may object to any claim set forth in such Claim Notice by
delivering written notice to the Indemnified Party (and, if applicable, to the
Escrow Agent), of the Indemnifying Partys objection (an "Indemnification
Objection Notice"). Such Indemnification Objection Notice must describe the
grounds for such objection in reasonable detail. If an Indemnification
Objection Notice is not delivered by the Representative (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party) to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Representative of the Claim Notice (the "Indemnification
Objection Period"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying Parties for the full amount
of the Damages set forth in such Claim Notice.

 

(d) _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. If the Representative (on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party) shall object in writing during the Indemnification
Objection Period to any claim or claims by an Indemnified Party made in any
Claim Notice, the Buyer shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of the
Indemnification Objection Notice to respond in a written statement to such
objection. If after such thirty (30)-day period there remains a dispute as to
any claims, the Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Party) on the
one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall attempt in good faith for
twenty (20) days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnified Party and the
Representative agree to a resolution of such objection, and cash remains in
the account within the applicable Escrow Fund, then the Buyer and the
Representative shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
statement setting forth such conclusively resolved matters and directing
the Escrow Agent to distribute cash from the applicable Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of such statement. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation, each of the Buyer and the Representative
shall meet within ten (10) days of the expiration of such twenty (20)-day
period and negotiate in good faith for one (1) day with an impartial mediator
mutually agreed to by the parties in Boston, Massachusetts. If no agreement
can be reached after good faith mediation, each of Buyer and the
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Party), subject to Section 8.9,
bring suit to resolve the objection in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



-72- (e) _Delivery to Escrow Agent_. If, at the time of delivery of any Claim
Notice to the Representative (or of any Indemnification Objection Notice by
the Representative or response thereto by the Buyer), cash remains in the
applicable Escrow Fund, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice or
Indemnification Objection Notice (or response thereto) shall be delivered to
the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party.

 

Section 8.4 Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party desires to make a claim against
an Indemnifying Party in connection with any third-party Legal Proceeding at
any time instituted against or made upon it for which it may seek
indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will
promptly notify in writing the Representative of such Third-Party Claim and
of its claims of indemnification with respect thereto; _provided_ , that
failure or delay to promptly give such notice will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Section
8.4(a), except to the extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party has actually
been materially prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) Except in the case of Third-Party Claims (i) in which the remedy sought
in such Third-Party Claim includes an injunction or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party, (ii) arising in connection with a criminal or quasi-
criminal proceeding against the Indemnified Party, (iii) alleging that the
operation of the Companys business or the development, manufacture,
marketing, distribution, import or sale of any Customer Offering, developed by
the Company prior to the Closing Date, by the Buyer infringes,
misappropriates, or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property or
other proprietary rights of any third party, (iv) involving the Indemnifying
Party or its Affiliates as a party if counsel to the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that joint representation would give rise to a
conflict of interest (in the case of any of which the provisions of Section
8.4(d) shall apply), or (v) which constitute the First Special Indemnity
Matter or are pending or threatened Legal Proceedings or the Clause (xii)
Special Indemnity Matters, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Party has
received notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense if (x) it
acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines,
costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party
in connection with such Third-Party Claim shall constitute Damages for which
the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, and (y) the
claimant seeks the recovery of a sum of money that does not exceed the then-
current balance of the applicable Escrow Fund (as reduced by the amount of all
other pending claims against the funds in the account within the Escrow Fund
and assuming the full amount of such claims were actually paid), and,
_provided_ _further,_ that (i) the assumption of defense by the Indemnifying
Party shall relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject
to indemnification hereunder; (ii) the Indemnifying Party must take reasonable
steps to conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently
thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard; and, (iii) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim.

 



-73- (c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any Order
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without
the prior consent of the Indemnified Party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the Order or proposed settlement (i)
includes an unconditional release of all liability of each Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) involves only the payment of
money damages by the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying
Party has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 8.4, the Indemnified Party will not consent to
the entry of any Order or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not or is not entitled to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may
defend against, and consent to the entry of any Order or enter in any
settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim only with the prior consent
of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless in connection with a settlement where the
proposed settlement is in an amount less than or equal to $250,000; (ii) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Damages the Indemnified
Party may suffer as a result of such Third-Party Claim to the extent provided
in this Section 8.4, (iii) the Indemnified Party will consult with the
Representative with respect to strategic and planning matters in connection
with such Third-Party Claim, and (iv) the Indemnified Party will keep the
Representative informed in all material respects of the status of such Third-
Party Claim and will promptly inform the Representative of any changes in the
status of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that in connection with
any Pre-Closing IP Indemnity Claim or any Clause (xii) Special Indemnity
Matter, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
of the Third-Party Claim, Buyer shall consult with Michael Sharp, in a manner
reasonably acceptable to Michael Sharp, so long as Michael Sharp is reasonably
available and willing to consult with the Buyer and does not unreasonably
delay or withhold his participation, in connection with the defense of such
Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may
consent to the entry of any Order or enter into any settlement with respect to
any Third-Party Claim related to the First Special Indemnity Matter or the
Clause (xii) Special Indemnity Matters without consulting with or obtaining
the consent of the Representative, _provided_ , that in the event that such
consent is not obtained: (A) the indemnification obligations of the Company
Stockholders in connection with the First Special Indemnity Matter shall not
exceed $2,000,000, and (B) in the event the Damages in connection with the
Clause (xii) Special Indemnity Matters exceed $3,000,000, the Company
Stockholders shall be responsible for 100% of the first $3,000,000 in Damages
plus an amount equal to 75% of any Damages in excess of $3,000,000.

 

(e) The party not controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim
(the "Non-Controlling Party") may participate therein at its own expense. The
party controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim (the "Controlling
Party") shall keep the Non- Controlling Party advised of the status of such
Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-

 



-74-  Controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-Controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Third-Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint
or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

Section 8.5 Payment of Claims. In order to satisfy any indemnification
obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 8.2, the Buyer
(and each of the Indemnified Parties) shall recover Damages:

 

(a) first, from the Escrow Fund to the extent available and subject to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement ( _provided_ , that all claims that are First
Special Indemnity Matters (the "First Special Indemnity Section") shall be
paid first from the First Special Escrow Fund prior to the Primary Escrow
Fund, all claims that are Pre-Closing IP Indemnity Claims, Communications
Matters or Clause (xii) Special Indemnity Matters (collectively, the "Second
Special Indemnity Sections") and any Third-Party Claim relating to a breach
of Section 2.14 ( _Intellectual Property_ ) that is in respect of a single set
of facts or Circumstances with a Pre-Closing IP Indemnity Claim by the Buyer
shall be paid first from the Second Special Escrow Fund prior to the Primary
Escrow Fund, and that all other claims shall be paid first from the Primary
Escrow Fund), and

 

(b) thereafter, subject to Section 8.6(b) and the other limitations set

transfer of immediately available funds;

_provided_ , that the obligations of the Company Stockholders under
this Section 8.5 shall be several and not joint. All such recoveries whether
from the Escrow Fund or directly from the Company Stockholders shall be made
based on the Pro Rata Percentage with respect to each Company Stockholder,
except as provided in Section 8.6(b). The Representative shall make the final
determination as to each Company Stockholders Pro Rata Percentage and, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the Company Stockholders shall not be
entitled to make any claim against the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) in respect of such determination.

Stockholder for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII will not

-76- (b) _Adjustments for Joining Company Stockholders_. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in the event the Pro Rata
Percentage held by Company Stockholders that have executed a Joinder and
Waiver Agreement (the "Approving or Joining Percentage") is less than one
hundred percent (100%) and the Buyer is entitled to recover directly from the
Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 8.5, the Buyer shall be
entitled to recover from the Company Stockholders that have executed a Joinder
and Waiver Agreement (the "Joining Company Stockholders"), and such recovery
shall be calculated as follows (in the case of recovery beyond any applicable
Escrow Fund): (i) in the event the Approving or Joining Percentage represents
Company Stockholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Percentage of less than
ninety eight percent (98%), the Buyer shall nevertheless be entitled to
recover from the Joining Company Stockholders, an amount equal to ninety-eight
percent (98%) of the Damages (with the recoveries from each such Joining
Company Stockholder to be based on the Joining Company Stockholder Pro Rata
Percentage with respect to such Joining Company Stockholder); and (ii) in the
event the Approving or Joining Percentage represents Company Stockholders
with an aggregate Pro Rata Percentage of ninety eight percent (98%) or
greater, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover from the Joining Company
Stockholders, an amount equal to the Approving or Joining Percentage of the
Damages (with the recoveries from each such Joining Company Stockholder to be
based on the Pro Rata Percentage with respect to such Joining Company
Stockholder) (such amount under clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, the
"Joining Company Stockholder Amount").

(c) _Threshold._ Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, (i) the Company Stockholders shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim for
indemnification resulting from or arising out of matters described in Section
8.2 unless and until the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds
$1,750,000 (the "Primary Threshold") ( _provided_ , that such threshold for
any claim for indemnification resulting from or arising out of matters
described in the Second Special Indemnity Sections (other than the Clause
(xii) Special Indemnity Matter) shall be $250,000 (the "Secondary
Threshold")), in which event the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover the full amount of Damages (including any amounts of Damages within
the Primary Threshold or Secondary Threshold, as applicable) resulting from
or arising out of such matters in accordance with this Section 8, and (ii) no
individual claim for indemnification resulting from or arising out of matters
described in Section 8.2 shall be counted towards the Primary Threshold or
the Secondary Threshold unless and until the aggregate amount of such claim
exceeds $5,000 (the "Per Claim Threshold"), in which event the full amount of
Damages with respect to such claim shall count towards the Primary Threshold
or the Secondary Threshold, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8.6(c), the Primary Threshold, Secondary Threshold
and Per Claim Threshold limits imposed by this Section 8.6(c) shall not apply
to any Damages (i) indemnifiable under Section 8.2(a)(i) solely with respect
to any Fundamental Representation or Second Level Representation, (ii)
indemnifiable under Section 8.2(a)(iv) solely with respect to claims brought
by or on behalf of any individual listed in Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure

the Damages attributed to the fees and expenses (including court costs, costs
of investigation, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors and other experts and other expenses of settlement, litigation,
arbitration or 

 



-77-  other dispute resolution proceedings) of such claim exceed $1,000,000, the
indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders shall be for 100% of
such fees and expenses up to $1,000,000 and an amount equal to 75% of such
fees and expenses in excess of $1,000,000; and (ii) in the event the Damages
attributed to the monetary damages, fines, Taxes and losses (including amounts
paid in settlement and any interest) of such claim are attributed to both the
Pre-Closing IP Indemnity Claim and other matters related to the business of
the Buyer (excluding the business of the Company), the indemnification
obligations of the Company Stockholders for such claim shall be for an amount
equal solely to the portion of such Damages attributed to the Pre-Closing IP
Indemnity Claim.

 

(e) In all cases in determining the amount of any Damages with respect to a
breach of a representation or warranty by any Party for purposes of this
Agreement (but not for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach
of such representation or warranty), such representations and warranties
(other than Section 2.7(s)) shall be read without regard to any materiality
qualifier (including any reference to Company Material Adverse Effect)
contained therein.

(f) All Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be net of insurance proceeds
actually received by such Indemnified Party, indemnity payments and any other
amounts such Indemnified Party actually recovers from third parties to which
such Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of such Damages incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event an Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to
any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any other amounts from third
parties in respect of any Damages for which such Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts (including commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any denial of coverage to be reversed or rescinded) to
obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits, payments or amounts. In
any case where an Indemnified Party recovers, under insurance policies,
indemnity payments or from other third parties, any amount in respect of a
matter for which such Indemnified Party was indemnified pursuant to this
Article VIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
amount of the expenses (including increases in premiums) incurred by such
Indemnified Party in procuring such recovery); _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Indemnified Party shall be required to pay over to the Indemnifying Party
any amount so recovered under such insurance policies or from such other third
parties to the extent (but only to the extent) that such amount so recovered
was previously taken into account pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 8.6(e).

(g) The indemnification provided for in this Article VIII shall survive any
investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or
any knowledge or information that the Indemnified Party may have.

 

Section 8.7 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made pursuant to
this Article VIII shall be treated as an adjustment to the Total Merger
Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes and reported as such by the
Parties on their Tax Returns to the greatest extent permitted by Law.

 



-78- Section 8.8 Remedy. Each Indemnified Party acknowledges and agrees that,
except (i) in the case where an Indemnified Party seeks to obtain specific
performance pursuant to Section 9.13 or (ii) as otherwise expressly provided
for in this Agreement, its sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing
Date with respect to any and all claims under or relating to this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
VIII; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party hereto shall be
deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies to the
extent (x) based upon allegations of Fraud or (y) such rights, claims, causes
of action or remedies may not be waived under applicable Law.

 

Section 8.9 Right to Bring Action; No Contribution. Each Company
Stockholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Company Stockholder
shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against the Company in connection with any indemnification obligation
or any other liability to which such stockholder may become subject under or
in connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Article
VIII or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, only the Representative shall have the right, power and
authority to commence or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding, including
any arbitration proceeding, by and on behalf of any or all Company
Stockholders against the Buyer or the Company, and in no event shall any
Company Stockholder himself, herself or itself have the right to commence or
prosecute any action, suit or proceeding, including any arbitration
proceeding, against the Buyer or the Company in connection with the Buyers
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , that the DandO Indemnified
Persons, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall have the right, power
and authority to commence or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding,
including any arbitration proceeding, against the Buyer or the Company in
connection with the Buyers obligations under Section 5.15.

 

Section 8.10 No Duplicate Recovery. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article VIII, (i) to the extent (and only to the extent)
that any Damages resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company under Article II, Article IV
or Article V or pursuant to Article VIII that were taken into account in the
calculation of, and actually reduced, the Total Merger Consideration, no
Indemnified Party may recover such Damages through an indemnification claim
pursuant to this Article VIII or otherwise and (ii) no Indemnified Party may
recover duplicative Damages in respect of a single set of facts or
circumstances under more than one representation or warranty in this Agreement
regardless of whether such facts or circumstances would give rise to a breach
of more than one representation or warranty in this Agreement.

covenants (which in the case of any breach of covenant has not been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notification thereof by the terminating
Party to the other Party) of the non-terminating Party set forth in this

to the terminating Partys obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and such events continue in effect for thirty (30) days

contemplated hereby at or prior to such time;

shall have issued a final and nonappealable order having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

other agreements and any other closing documents shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or

jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in
the event, but only in the event, that such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the Superior Court of the

Agreement, (x) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason other than the failure to
serve in accordance with this Section 10.9, (y) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in Chosen Courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably consents to service being made through the

(ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or
singular number, respectively, (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby"
and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement as a whole and

Section or other subdivision of the body of this Agreement, (v) the words

unless otherwise indicated. All accounting terms used herein and not expressly
defined herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP. When used
herein, the terms "third party" or "third parties" refers to Persons other
than the Buyer, the Company Stockholders, the Representative or the Company.
Unless stated otherwise, a reference to USD$, $US, dollar or $ is a
reference to U.S. currency. All

 



-84-  amounts hereunder shall be payable in U.S. currency. For the avoidance of
doubt, documents posted by the Company, the Company Stockholders or their
respective representatives in the electronic or virtual data room maintained

Section 10.12 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that this
Agreement is the product of negotiation between sophisticated parties and
individuals, all of whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an
opportunity to participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each
provision hereof. Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall
not be construed strictly or in favor of or against any Party hereto but
rather shall be given a fair and reasonable construction without regard to the
rule of _contra_ _proferentem_.

 

Section 10.13 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except in the case of
Fraud or willful misconduct, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed exclusive of any other remedy conferred by law or
equity upon such Party; _provided_ , that the parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage shall occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 10.9 without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement. The right of specific performance is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, neither the Company nor Buyer would have entered into this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 Counterparts, Delivery by Facsimile or PDF. This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed
an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement and any signed Contract entered into in connection
herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the
extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, or by email in
portable document format (pdf) or other similar image format, shall be treated
in all manner and respects as an original hereof or thereof and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto
or to any such Contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms hereof or thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No
Party hereto or to any such Contract shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine, or by email in portable document format or other similar image
format, to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine, or email in
portable document format or other similar image format, as a defense to
the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such
defense.

it has not received and is not relying upon Tax advice from any other Party
hereto, and that it has and will continue to consult its own advisors with
respect to Taxes.
