Agreement " **Closing Date** " shall mean the date on which the Closing
occurs.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the Closing, the parties
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the State Department
of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " **Maryland Department** ")
articles of merger (the " **Articles of Merger** ") in connection with the
Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the
MGCL, and the parties shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the MGCL and all other applicable Law in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger are accepted
for record by the Maryland Department or such later date (not to exceed 30
days after the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the Maryland
Department) and time as shall be agreed to in writing by the Company and
Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time the Merger
becomes effective, the " **Effective Time** ").

 



 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



 

2.4 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the Organizational
Documents of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company, until
thereafter amended, subject to _Section 6.10(b)_, in accordance with their
respective terms and applicable Law.

 



 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. From and after the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Company, and such directors and officers shall serve until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

2.6 _Directors of Parent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
necessary corporate action so that upon and after the Effective Time, the size
of the Parent Board is increased by one member, and Gilbert E. Nathan ("
**Nathan** ") (the " **Company Director Designee** ") is elected to the Parent
Board to fill the vacancy on the Parent Board created by such increase. In the
event that Nathan is unable or unwilling to serve on the Parent Board, then a
substitute shall be designated by the Company on the earlier to occur of (1)
five Business Days after the date that such Company Director Designee is
determined to be unable to serve or informs the Company that he or she is
unwilling to serve and (2) the Closing Date, which substitute member shall be
deemed to be a Company Director Designee for purposes of this Agreement. Any
such replacement for Nathan shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent
Board. If the Closing occurs before Parents 2019 annual meeting of the
stockholders of Parent, then Parent, through the Parent Board, shall nominate
such Company Director Designee for election to the Parent Board in the proxy
statement relating to the 2019 annual meeting of the stockholders of Parent
following Closing. Any Company Director Designee made in substitute for Nathan
must meet the qualifications of an "independent director" under the rules of
the NYSE. The Company Director Designee must provide to Parent

 



     

 

 



 

the information in respect of the Company Director Designee that would be
required by Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act for inclusion in proxy
materials relating to the election of directors if any Company Director
Designee were nominated for election as a director. The provisions of this
_Section 2.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, the Company Director Designee. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Company under this _Section 2.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of the Company Director Designee
unless (a) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(b) the Company Director Designee have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that any Company
Director Designee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 2.6_).
The Parent Board shall not be required to take any action contemplated by this
_Section 2.6_ if the Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that taking such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

2.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) this Agreement be, and hereby is adopted
as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 354 and 361 of the
Code. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the parties to this
Agreement shall file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the intended tax treatment of the Merger described in this
_Section 2.7_, and no party shall take a position inconsistent with such
treatment.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB;
EXCHANGE**

 



 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. The membership interest of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as membership interests of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" **Company Common
Stock** "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Cancelled Shares, as defined below), shall be converted into
the right to receive from Parent that number of validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "
**Merger Consideration** "). As used in this Agreement, " **Exchange Ratio** "
means 1.441 (the " **Base Ratio** "), subject to adjustment as provided below.

 



 

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)(i)_, shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each

 



     

 

 



 

holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger
Consideration, (B) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with
_Section 3.2(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_, in each case, to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with _Section
3.2_.

 



 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub or by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the " **Cancelled Shares** ").

 



 

(c) _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_.

 



 

(i) If (x) the Company Book Value Per Share on the Determination Date is equal
to or greater than $21.86, and (y) the Parent Book Value Per Share is equal to
or greater than $16.63, the Base Ratio shall not be adjusted, subject to
_Section 3.1(d)_, and shall be the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(ii) If the Company Book Value Per Share on the Determination Date is less
than $$21.86, or the Parent Book Value Per Share on the Determination Date is
less than $16.63, then the Exchange Ratio shall be the product of the Base
Ratio multiplied by the Parent Adjustment Ratio multiplied by the Company
Adjustment Ratio.

 



 

(iii) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days
after the Determination Date, each of Parent and the Company shall prepare and
deliver to the other a schedule (each, a " **Proposed Book Value Schedule** ")
setting forth their respective calculations of Parent Book Value Per Share and
Company Book Value Per Share, respectively, together with such supporting
documentation as the Receiving Party may reasonably request.

 



 

(iv) Within three Business Days after its delivery of the others Proposed
Book Value Schedule, each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other
whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the others Proposed Book Value
Schedule. If Parent or the Company disputes the accuracy of the others
Proposed Book Value Schedule, the Receiving Party shall notify the Calculating
Party in reasonable detail within the same three Business Day period of those
items and amounts as to which the Receiving Party disagrees and shall set
forth the Receiving Partys calculation of such disputed amounts (a "
**Dispute Notice** "), and the Receiving Party shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Calculating Partys Proposed
Book Value Schedule. If Parent or the Company notifies the other that it
accepts the others Proposed Book Value Schedule or does not deliver a Dispute
Notice during such three Business Day period, it shall be deemed to have
accepted the accuracy of the others Proposed Book Value Schedule, and the
calculations of the Parent Book Value Per Share or Company Book Value Per
Share, as applicable, set forth therein shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the parties.

 



     

 

 



 

(v) If a Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by Parent or the Company,
the Calculating Party and the Receiving Party shall forthwith jointly request
that a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized registered independent
public accounting firm (the " **Independent Accounting Firm** ") make a
binding determination only as to the items set forth in the Dispute Notice in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Independent Accounting Firm
will, under the terms of its engagement, be required to render its written
decision with respect to such disputed items and amounts within four Business
Days from the date of referral. If Parent and the Company both deliver Dispute
Notices, the same Independent Accounting Firm shall be appointed to resolve
both sets of disputes. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only
those items or amounts in the Proposed Book Value Schedule as to which the
Receiving Party and the Calculating Party are in disagreement. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Receiving Party and the Calculating Party
a written report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Proposed Book
Value Schedule based on the Independent Accounting Firms determination with
respect to the disputed items and amounts in accordance with this Agreement
and such report shall include the calculations supporting such adjustments;
provided, that for each item as to which the Calculating Party and the
Receiving Party are in disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall
assign a value for such item no greater than the higher amount, and no less
than the lower amount, calculated or proposed by the Calculating Party or the
Receiving Party with respect to such item, as the case may be. Such report
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and neither party nor
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives will seek recourse to
any courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm for purposes of this _Section 3.1(c)(v)_ shall be
shared equally by Parent and the Company, but such fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall not adjust either the Company Book Value Per
Share or the Parent Book Value Per Share.

 



 

(vi) Subject to _Section _ _3.1(d)_ , as soon as practicable (but not more
than two Business Days) following the final determination of the Parent Book
Value Per Share, the Company Book Value Per Share and the Exchange Ratio,
Parent and the Company shall make a joint public statement to disclose the
Exchange Ratio (" **Exchange Ratio Announcement** ").

 



 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration._ The Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as
applicable), subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
_Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

 



      

 

 



 

3.2 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent to
act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the " **Exchange Agent** ") and to receive the Merger Consideration
and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.2(g)_, to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to
this _Article III_. On or prior to the Closing Date and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock for issuance in accordance with this _Article III_ through the
Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
holders of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Parent agrees to deposit with the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ and to make payments in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by
this _Section 3.2(a)_ and _Sections 3.2(g)_ and _3.2(h)_ , the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 3.2(g)_) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " **Exchange Fund**." The Surviving Company shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or
other income resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall become part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
two Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each record holder, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (A) (1) shares represented by a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Common Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (2) shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (" **Book-Entry Shares** "), in each
case, which shares were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (B) a letter of
transmittal (" **Letter of Transmittal** "), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing and (C) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration
set forth in _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed

 



     

 

 



 

in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_ (which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder) and
(B) if applicable, a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company
Common Stock, it shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant
to _Section 3.2(g)_, in each case paid upon the surrender of and in exchange
for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing Cancelled Shares), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_, without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the 365th day
after the Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon
demand, and any former Company Stockholders who have not theretofore received
the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled under this _Article III_,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_, in each case without interest thereon, shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company and Parent for payment of their
claim for such amounts.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration or other amounts properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to
the time that is immediately prior to the time at which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate representing Cancelled Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.2_. Following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be paid to such
holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions declared and paid on shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date and a payment date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender, with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip or
shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such
fractional share interests will not

 



     

 

 



 

entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock
for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder),
the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from (i) the consideration to be paid by
Parent hereunder and (ii) any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. If Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent
believes that such deduction or withholding is required, Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall provide the Company with
written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to withholding any amount
pursuant to this _Section 3.2(i)_ such that the Company and/or the holders of
its Common Stock shall have the opportunity to eliminate or reduce such
deduction or withholding obligation by filing appropriate documentation or
taking other appropriate action, and subject to their respective obligations
under applicable Law, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent
shall cooperate in good faith with the Company and/or its holders of Common
Stock as necessary to eliminate or reduce such deduction or withholding. Any
such amounts so deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the relevant Taxing
Authority in accordance with applicable Law by the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, and such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(j) _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to
the date of this Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** ") and except
as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017 (the " **Company 2017 10-K** ") and each Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q filed thereafter (including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, but excluding any forward looking
disclosures set

 



     

 

 



 

forth in any "risk factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward looking
statements" section and any other disclosures included therein to the extent
they are predictive or forward looking in nature), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, as applicable, a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and,
where relevant, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, with all requisite entity power and authority
to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its properties, own its
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than where
the failure to be in good standing or to have such power or authority would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company (a " **Company Material Adverse
Effect** "). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and, where relevant, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, other than where the
failure to so qualify, be licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of its Organizational Documents.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an accurate
and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, including a list of each
Subsidiary that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section
856(i)(2) of the Code (" **Qualified REIT Subsidiary** "), or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code (" **Taxable REIT
Subsidiary** "), together with (i) the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, of such Subsidiary and (ii) the type and

Subsidiary.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
5,000,000 shares of Company preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share ("
**Company Preferred Stock** "). At the close of business on November 7, 2018:
(A) 8,482,880 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and

outstanding.

 



 

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are not subject to preemptive rights. All
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been issued and granted in
compliance in all material respects with applicable state and federal
securities Laws, the MGCL and the Organizational Documents of the Company. The
Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock, membership interests or partnership interests, as
applicable, of the Subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens. As of the close of business on November 7, 2018,

into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Capital Stock or
Voting Debt, or (iv) subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, exchange rights,
conversion rights, puts, rights of first refusal or other rights (including
preemptive rights), commitments or agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it is bound, in any case,
obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to (A) issue, deliver,
transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be issued, delivered,
transferred, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional shares of
Company Capital Stock, any Voting Debt or other voting securities of the
Company or (B) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option,
warrant, call, exchange right, conversion right, put, right of first refusal
or other similar right, commitment or agreement. Except as set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Company, there are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or other agreements to which the Company is a party or by which
it is bound relating to the voting of any shares of the Company Capital Stock.

by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties
or assets are bound, or (iii) assuming the Consents referred to in _Section
4.4_ are duly and timely obtained or made and the Company Stockholder Approval
has been obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any
Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their

Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and, where relevant, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of
its properties, makes such qualification, licensing or good standing

complete and correct copies of its Organizational Documents.

(a) Since December 31, 2016, Parent has filed or furnished with the SEC all
forms, reports, schedules and statements required to be filed or furnished
under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, respectively (such forms,

Parents internal controls over financial reporting, and, in each case,
neither Parent nor any of its Representatives has failed to disclose such
information to Parents auditors or the Parent Board.

Parent and not obtained from or incorporated by reference to the Parents
filings with the SEC.

Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses (the " **Parent Permits** "), except
where the failure to so hold would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits,
except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is in violation or breach of, or
default under, any Parent Permit, nor has Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
received any claim or notice indicating that Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent is currently not in compliance with the terms of any Parent Permits,
except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any Parent

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The businesses of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are not currently being conducted, and at no time since December

from being furnished pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ may be furnished until the
Company receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company that are no less
favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Company Board (or any
committee thereof), after consultation with its outside legal counsel;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement does not contain
provisions that prohibit the Company from complying with the provisions of
this _Section 6.3_, and (B) prior to taking any such actions, the Company
Board or any committee thereof determines, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior
Proposal; and

 



 

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to
a written, _bona fide_ Company Competing Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of _Section 6.3(a)_, _6.3(b)_ or _6.3(c)_ , if the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) so chooses, cause the Company to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_, if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) determines, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal is a
Company Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and
conditions of the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such Company
Competing Proposal), and (B) the Company shall have given notice to Parent
that the Company has received such Company Competing Proposal in accordance
with _Section 6.3(c)_, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, and, that the Company intends to take such action, and either (1)
Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the

 



     

 

 



 

Company Stockholders Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on
which such notice is given to Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would form a binding
contract if accepted by the Company, the Company Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, shall have determined that the Company Competing Proposal remains a
Company Superior Proposal with respect to Parents revised proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each time material modifications to the
financial terms of a Company Competing Proposal determined to be a Company
Superior Proposal are made, the time period set forth in this _Section
6.3(d)_ prior to which the Company may effect a Company Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for two Business
Days after notification of such change to Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company

(which is addressed in _Section 6.3(d)(iii)_), to make a Company Change of
Recommendation if, prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company
shall have given notice to Parent that the Company intends to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation (which notice will reasonably describe the reasons
for such Company Change of Recommendation), and either (A) Parent shall not

the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the third Business Day after the date on which such notice is
given to Parent, or (B) if Parent within the period described in the foregoing
_clause (A)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by
the Company, the Company Board (or any committee thereof), after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, shall have determined that such proposed
changes do not obviate the need for the Company Board to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation and that the failure to make a Company Change of
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors duties under applicable Law.

 



 

6.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, to make a Parent Change of Recommendation if, prior to
taking such action, (i) the Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law and (ii) Parent shall have given notice to the

thereof), after consultation with its outside legal counsel, shall have
determined that such proposed changes do not obviate the need for the Parent
Board to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation and that the failure to make
a Parent Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 



 

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 



 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of
Parent Capital Stock as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval and the Parent to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.
The Company will promptly furnish to Parent such data and information relating
to it, its Subsidiaries and the holders of its capital stock as Parent may

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall cooperate
in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually acceptable
Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the holders
of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the holders of
Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (of which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff.
Parent and the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act
as soon after such filing as practicable and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise
the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for amendment of
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for additional information.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the
Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and
Parent will (i) provide the other with an opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or response all
comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the
other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to documents filed by a
party that are incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with respect
to information relating to the other party, its Subsidiaries and its
Affiliates, their business, financial condition or results of operations or
the transactions contemplated hereby; and _provided_ , _further_

 



     

 

 



 

that the Company, in connection with any Company Change of Recommendation, or
Parent, in connection with any Parent Change of Recommendation, may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference)
and make other filings with the SEC, to effect such Company Change of
Recommendation or Parent Change of Recommendation, as applicable.

notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated.

 



 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders and the
Parent Stockholders.

 



 

6.6 _Stockholders Meetings_.

terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ hereof, the Companys
obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission of any Company Superior Proposal or Company Competing Proposal, or
by any Company Change of Recommendation. Unless there has been a Company
Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.3_, the Parties agree
to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any
efforts by any of the Companys stockholders or any other Person to prevent
the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from seeking approval from the Company Stockholders of
the termination of the Management Agreement.

respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or
engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(c) In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Merger, none of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company

cause the Company Manager and each affiliate of the Company Manager to deliver
to the Company all

 



     

 

 



 

contracts and records in the Company Managers or any of its affiliates
possession or control to the extent (with respect to the contracts) they are
contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and with
respect to records, to the extent they pertain to the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
records shall not include records that are the owned property of the Company
Manager and are not owned property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
each individual who is employed as of the Closing Date by the Company, or any
of its Subsidiaries (a " **Company Employee** ") and who remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) to be provided with (i) base compensation (salary or wages,
as applicable), and as applicable, annual bonus and incentive compensation
(including equity compensation) opportunities that are not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect for such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (including
retirement plan participation) and supplemental pay that are not materially
less favorable than those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent
immediately prior to the Closing Date, which employee benefits and
supplemental pay shall be provided through the Parent Plans.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Company Employees
shall be given credit for all purposes under the Parent Plans (other than with
respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA,
retiree medical benefits or disability benefits or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits) in which the Company Employees
participate, for such Company Employees service with the Company, or any of
its Subsidiaries, including vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual purposes,
to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into
account under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan of the Company Manager
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company and any of their respective Subsidiaries, to give service
credit for long term disability coverage purposes for the Company Employees
service with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company and any of their respective Subsidiaries to (i)
waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of any Company Employee
and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or
waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show
evidence of good health under the applicable health and welfare Parent Plan to
the same extent such conditions, periods or requirements had been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan of the Company Manager
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) credit the expenses of any
Company Employee that were credited towards applicable deductibles and annual
out-of-pocket limits under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan of the Company
Manager for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs against

for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Company or one of their
respective Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and other
paid time off days accrued or earned by such Company Employee as of the
Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit of the parties
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company, the
Company Manager or any of their respective Affiliates), any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 6.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who

all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including
attorneys and other professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a
party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in
part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is
or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" **Indemnified
Liabilities** "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this
Agreement or the Transactions, in each case, to the extent any such

retain the Companys regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Persons, and Parent and the Surviving Company

affect) adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents
of the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person
to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required
by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its

policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or such Subsidiary of
the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall not
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets or the
assets of any Subsidiary in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
render Parent or Surviving Company unable to satisfy their obligations under
this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to

Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense

the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent and the Surviving Company shall
pay all expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided

best efforts to defend against and respond thereto.

 



     

 

 



 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the parties. From and after the date hereof, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective controlled Affiliates or managers, shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless
(a) such party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is
required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such
partys capital stock is traded to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in
which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto or (b) in the case of the Company, it deems it necessary or
appropriate to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other

previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this _Section 6.12_.

 



 

6.13 _Control of Business_. Without limiting in any way any partys rights or
obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give any party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
other party and their respective Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold harmless against liability for any such
Transfer Taxes such other Persons. The parties will cooperate, in good faith,
in the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes and the
minimization, to the extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law, of
the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

6.15 _Notification_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (a) of any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any

connection with the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent, (b) of any legal
proceeding commenced or, to any partys knowledge, threatened against, such
party or any of its Affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or
affecting such party or any of its Affiliates, in each case, in connection
with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
Transaction, and (c) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending
occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent,
respectively, which would reasonably be

 



     

 

 



 

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to
the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article VIII_.

 



 

6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company

efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the parties shall take any action, or
fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain or cause to be provided, as appropriate, the opinions of counsel
described in _Sections 7.2(e)_ and _(f)_ and _Sections 7.3(e)_ and _7.3(f)_
, respectively. Provided that the opinions of counsel described in _Sections
7.2(f)_ and _7.3(f)_ have been received, the parties shall treat the Merger
as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, and no party shall
take any position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, unless otherwise
required by a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or a similar determination under applicable state or local Law).

 



 

6.19 _Additional Dividends_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a dividend to its
stockholders, the payment date for which shall be the close of business on the
last Business Day prior to the Closing Date, subject to funds being legally
available therefor. The record date for such dividends shall be three (3)
Business Days before the payment date. The per share dividend amount payable
by the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.19(a)_ shall be an amount up to
(i) the Companys then-most recent quarterly dividend (on a per share basis),
multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date
through and including the day prior to the Closing Date, and divided by the
actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is
declared, plus (ii) the quotient, whether positive or negative, of (A) (y)
$4,500,000 _minus_ (z) the Company Transaction Expenses incurred between
October 1, 2018 and the Closing

 



      

 

 



 

Date, including fees incurred on October 1, 2018 and on the Closing Date,
_divided by_ (B) the number of shares outstanding as of the record date, plus
(iii) an additional amount (the " **Company Additional Dividend Amount** "),
if any, necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable is equal to the
Minimum Distribution Dividend. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good
faith to determine whether it is necessary to declare a Company Additional
Dividend Amount and the amount (if any) of the Company Additional Dividend
Amount.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall declare a dividend to its
stockholders, the record and payment date for which shall be the close of
business on the last business day prior to the Closing Date, subject to funds
being legally available therefor. The per share dividend amount payable by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.19(b)_ shall be an amount up to (i)
Parents then-most recent quarterly dividend (on a per share basis),
multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date
through and including the day prior to the Closing Date, and divided by the
actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is
declared, plus (ii) any additional per share amount equal to the Company

efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such
Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all
action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Law on the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

6.21 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with the other
parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
Company Common Stock from the NYSE American and terminate its registration

effective until after the Effective Time.

 



 

6.22 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other

reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that, on the basis of the
facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such
opinion, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering the opinion described in this
_Section 7.2(f)_, counsel shall be entitled to require and rely upon
customary representations contained in certificates of officers of the Company
and Parent, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and
Parent.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Management Agreement_. The Management Agreement shall have
been validly terminated with immediate effect on terms that impose no
incremental obligations on the Company or the Surviving Company not
anticipated by the Management Agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company_. The obligation of
the Company to consummate the Merger is subject to the satisfaction at or
prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions, any or all of which
may be waived exclusively by the Company, in whole or in part, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_. (i) The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section
5.3(a)_ ( _Authority_ ), _Section 5.6(a)_ ( _Parent Material Adverse Effect_
) and _Section 5.17_ ( _Brokers_ ) shall be true and correct as of the
Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except that
representations and warranties that speak as of a specified date shall have
been true and correct only as of such date), (ii) the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ ( _Capital
Structure_ ) shall be true and correct in all but _de minimis_ respects as of
the specific date set forth therein, and (iii) all other representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Article V_ of this
Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date, as though made on
and as of the Closing Date (except that representations and warranties that
speak as of specified date shall have been true and correct only as of such
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct (without regard to qualification or exceptions contained
therein as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect") would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub each shall have performed, or complied with, in all material respects all
agreements and covenants required to be performed or complied with by them
under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Compliance Certificate_. The Company shall have received a certificate of
Parent signed by an executive officer of Parent, dated the Closing Date,
confirming that the conditions in _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _(b)_ have been
satisfied.

 



 

(d) _No Parent Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement,
there shall have been no event, change, effect or development that,
individually or in the aggregate with other events, changes, effects or
developments, has had or reasonably would be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) _REIT Opinion_. The Company shall have received a written opinion of
Clifford Chance US, LLP (or other counsel to Parent reasonably satisfactory to
the Company), dated as of the Closing Date and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that, commencing with
Parents taxable year ended December 31, 2011, Parent has been organized and
operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as
a REIT under the Code and its actual method of operation has enabled Parent to
meet, through the Effective Time, the requirements for qualification and
taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that its past, current and intended
future organization and operations will permit Parent to continue to qualify
for taxation as a REIT under the Code for its taxable year which includes the
Effective Time and thereafter. Such opinion will be subject to customary
exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations contained in officers certificates executed by Parent and the
Company; provided that the Company is given a reasonable opportunity to review
such representations and finds them reasonably acceptable.

 



 

(f) _Section 368 Opinion_. The Company shall have received a written opinion
of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. (or other counsel to the Company reasonably
satisfactory to Parent), dated as of the Closing Date and in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that, on the
basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to
in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering the opinion described in
this _Section 7.3(f)_, counsel shall be entitled to require and rely upon
customary representations contained in certificates of officers of the Company
and Parent, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and
Parent.

 



 

(g) _Listing; Classification_. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance.

 



 

7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the parties may rely, either
as a basis for not consummating the Merger or for terminating this Agreement,
on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _7.2_ or _7.3_ ,
as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys
breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement.

date;

 



 

(iii) in the event of a breach by the other party of any covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement or if any representation and warranty of
the other party contained in this Agreement fails to be true and correct which
(A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ or _(b)_ , as applicable, if it was
continuing as of the Closing Date and (B) cannot be or has not been cured by
the earlier of 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching
party of such breach or inaccuracy and the basis for such notice, and the date
of the proposed termination (a " **Terminable Breach** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the terminating party is not then in Terminable Breach of any

(a) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other party specifying with particularity the reason for such termination,

other party.

 



 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party as provided in
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of any party except with respect to
this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, _Section 6.7(b)_, _Section 8.3_ and _Articles I_
and _IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no such termination shall relieve any party from liability
for any damages (including, in the case of the Company, damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the Company
Stockholders, which shall be deemed to be damages of the Company) for a
Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder
or intentional fraud, or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in
which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity.

 



 

8.3 _Expenses and Other Payments_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party shall pay its
own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, whether or not the Merger
shall be consummated.

 



 

(b) If (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ (
_Company Change of Recommendation_ ) then the Company shall pay Parent the
Company Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent no later than three Business Days
after notice of termination of this Agreement; or (ii) the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ ( _Company Superior Proposal_

available funds to an account designated by Parent contemporaneously with such
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_

after notice of termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If either the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i)
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)(A)_ ( _Failure to Obtain Company Stockholder Approval_ ),
then the Company shall pay Parent the Parent Expenses or (ii) _Section
8.1(b)(iv)(B)_ ( _Failure to Obtain Parent Stockholder Approval_ ), then
Parent shall pay the Company the Company Expenses, in each case, no later than
three Business Days after notice of termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If (i) (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)(A)_ ( _Failure to Obtain Company Stockholder Approval_ ),
or (B) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (
_Company Terminable Breach_ ), (ii) on or before the date of any such
termination a Company Competing Proposal shall have been announced, disclosed
or otherwise communicated to the Company Board and not withdrawn, and (iii)
within 12 months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive Agreement with respect to such Company Competing Proposal or
consummates such Company Competing Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent
the Company Termination Fee less any amount previously paid by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_. For purposes of this _Section 8.3(e)_, any
reference in the definition of Company Competing Proposal to "25%" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%."

 



 

(f) If (i) (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)(B)_ ( _Failure to Obtain Parent Stockholder Approval_ ),
or (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section

Company the Parent Termination Fee less any amount previously paid by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_. For purposes of this _Section 8.3(f)_, any
reference in the definition of Parent Competing Proposal to "25%" shall be
deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%."

 



 

(g) In no event shall Parent be entitled to receive more than one payment of a
Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if Parent receives a Company Termination Fee, then Parent will not
be entitled to also receive a payment of the Parent Expenses. In no event
shall the Company be entitled to receive more than one payment of a Parent
Termination Fee or Company Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
if the Company receives a Parent Termination Fee, then the Company will not be
entitled to also receive a payment of the Company Expenses. The parties agree
that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of
the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement. If a party fails to promptly pay the amount due by
it

 



     

 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, interest shall accrue on such amount from the
date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at the rate of 5% per annum. If, in order
to obtain such payment, the other party commences a Proceeding that results in
judgment for such party for such amount, the defaulting party shall pay the
other party its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
Proceeding. The parties agree that the monetary remedies set forth in _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ and this _Section 8.3_ and the specific performance remedies set
forth in _Section 9.11_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent and Merger Sub and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in
the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only Parent shall be liable
for damages for such intentional fraud or Willful and Material Breach), and
upon payment of such amount, none of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or Affiliates shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions, except for the liability of Parent in the case of
intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of any covenant, agreement
or obligation; and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated except in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and
Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which case only
the Company shall be liable for damages for such intentional fraud or Willful
and Material Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for the liability of
the Company in the case of intentional fraud or a Willful and Material Breach
of any covenant, agreement or obligation.

 



 

(h) In the event that Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee:

 



 

(i) The amount payable to the Company in any tax year of the Company shall not
exceed the lesser of (A) the Parent Termination Fee payable to the Company,
and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" **Qualifying Income** ") and the Company
has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Companys independent
accountants, _plus_ (2) in the event that the Company received either (x) a
letter from the Companys counsel indicating that the Company has received a
ruling from the IRS as described below or (y) an opinion from the Companys
outside counsel as described below, an amount equal to the excess of the
Parent Termination Fee less the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) To secure Parents obligation to pay the amounts described in _Section
8.3(h)(i)_, Parent shall deposit into escrow the amount in cash equal to the
Parent Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by Parent on such terms
(subject to this _Section 8.3_) as shall be mutually and reasonably agreed
upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall be
made at the time Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee. The
escrow agent shall provide that the Parent Termination Fee in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless the escrow agent
receives any one or a combination of the following: (A) a letter from the
Companys independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid by the escrow agent to the Company without causing the Company to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and the Company has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during
such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (B) a letter from the
Companys counsel indicating that (1) the Company has received a ruling from
the IRS holding that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee
should either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or
(2) the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect
that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee should either
constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Parent Termination Fee to the
Company. Parent agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(h)_ at the reasonable
request of the Company in order to (a) maximize that portion of the Parent
Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Company hereunder without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(3) of the Code or (b) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable
ruling from the IRS or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case,
as described in this _Section 8.3(h)(ii)_. Any amount of the Parent
Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be
paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitation of this _Section 8.3(h)_.

 



 

(i) In the event that the Company is required to pay the Company Termination
Fee:

 



 

(i) The amount payable to Parent in any tax year of Parent shall not exceed
the lesser of (A) the Company Termination Fee payable to Parent, and (B) the
sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of
the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and Parent has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case, as determined by Parents independent accountants, plus
(2) in the event that Parent received either (x) a letter from Parents
counsel indicating that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as described
below or (y) an opinion from Parents

 



     

 

 



 

outside counsel as described below, an amount equal to the excess of the
Company Termination Fee less the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Companys obligation to pay the amounts described in
_Section 8.3(h)(i)_, the Company shall deposit into escrow the amount in cash
equal to the Company Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the
Company on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3_) as shall be mutually
and reasonably agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The
payment or deposit into escrow of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay the
Company Termination Fee. The escrow agent shall provide that the Company
Termination Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to
Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or a combination of the
following: (A) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (B) a letter from Parents
counsel indicating that (1) Parent has received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee should either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (2) Parents
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by
Parent of the Company Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying
Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall
release the remainder of the Company Termination Fee to Parent. The Company
agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(i)_ at the reasonable request of Parent in
order to (a) maximize that portion of the Company Termination Fee that may be
distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (b) assist
Parent in obtaining a favorable ruling from the IRS or legal opinion from its
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section 8.3(i)(ii)_. Any
amount of the Company Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitation of this _Section 8.3(i)_.

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel
of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of
this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice of
independent counsel. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and
preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any
and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the parties shall be deemed
the work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision
that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against
any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely

court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement
or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate.

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other

of (x) the Company or (y) any Person who controls the Company. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, no Company Affiliate shall have any
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub of any nature whatsoever in
connection with or under this Agreement or the Transactions, and Parent and
Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims of any such liability and
obligation.

 



 

(b) Each of the following is herein referred to as a " **Parent Affiliate** ":

9.11 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by the parties. Prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, it is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 9.11_, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or
in equity.

 



 

(c) This parties rights in this _Section 9.11_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each party accordingly agrees not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.11_. Each party further agrees
that no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.11_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If prior to the End Date,
any party hereto brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall
automatically be extended by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action.

 



 

9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

9.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after adoption of this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after any such adoption, no
amendment shall be made which by law would require the further approval by
such stockholders without first obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

 



 

9.14 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may,
to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
other party hereunder; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other party contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
No agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid unless set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.
