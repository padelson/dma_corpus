are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:    ARTICLE II   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to

Preferred Stock") in accordance with this Article II (the "Series A Exchange
Ratio") shall be determined by dividing (x) an amount equal to $9.99 plus
any declared but unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred
Stock (such amount, the "Series A Amount") by (y) $84.5705 (the amount

Common Stock Price"). The aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to be converted in the Merger pursuant to this Article II multiplied by

in accordance with this Article II (the "Series B Exchange Ratio") shall be
determined by dividing an amount equal to $14.99 plus any declared but unpaid
dividends on such share of Series B Preferred Stock (such amount, the "Series
B Amount") by the Average Buyer Common Stock Price. The aggregate number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted in the Merger pursuant to
this Article II multiplied by the Series B Amount is hereinafter referred to
as the "Series B Proceeds."   (c) The number of shares (or fraction of a

Proceeds."   (d) The number of Shares (or fraction of a share) of Buyer
Common Stock to the issued in the Merger for each shares of Series
D Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Series
D Preferred Stock") in accordance with this Article II (the "Series

Preferred Stock (such amount, the "Series D Amount") by the Average Buyer
Common Stock Price. The aggregate number of shares of Series D Preferred
Stock to be converted in the Merger pursuant to this Article II multiplied by
the Series D Amount is hereinafter referred to as the "Series D Proceeds"
and together with the Series A Proceeds, the Series B Proceeds and the Series

$2.4 billion less the Aggregate Preferred Stock Proceeds by (ii) the Fully
Diluted Common Stock Number (as defined herein) and dividing the result

Preferred Stock Conversion") shall not be considered to be shares of Series D
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but shall be considered to have been so converted.   (f)
The aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger in accordance with this Article II is hereinafter referred to as the
"Merger Shares", 90% of such aggregate number of Merger Shares is hereinafter

number of Merger Shares is hereinafter referred to as the "Escrow Shares".

number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares (or cash in
lieu of a fraction of a share) of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Series D
Exchange Ratio. All such shares of Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
formerly representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Buyer Common

Article II and Section 6.7) and (ii) each of the Series A Exchange Ratio, the
Series B Exchange Ratio, the Series C Exchange Ratio and the Series D
Exchange Ratio (each for purposes of this Article II) shall be
proportionately and equitably adjusted to reflect such stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares of similar transaction.   (e) Company Stock Options. All
Options which are outstanding and not exercised as of the Effective Time,
will be assumed by the Buyer in accordance with Section 6.7.   2.3 Exchange

Company Affiliate Agreement (as defined herein).   (b) At the Closing
(after the Effective Time), the Buyer shall (i) deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to each Company Stockholder a certificate representing a number of
whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to (x) the sum of the number of

number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Series A Exchange
Ratio, plus the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such
Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Series B Exchange Ratio, plus the number of shares of Series C Preferred

number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to such Company
Stockholder\'s Ownership Percentage Interest (as set forth on the Closing
Stockholder Schedule) in the Escrow Shares and (ii) deposit (or cause to be
deposited) in escrow on behalf of such Company Stockholder a number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock equal to such Company Stockholder\'s Ownership
Percentage Interest (as set forth on the Closing Stockholder Schedule) in the
Escrow Shares, to be held and released in accordance with an
escrow agreement among the Buyer, the Stockholder Representative (as defined
in Section 8.6) and State Street Bank and Trust Company, Inc. or such
other escrow agent as the Parties shall mutually agree (the "Escrow
Agent") substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"), which shares shall be included in and represented by the single
certificate for the Escrow Shares which shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.   (c) If any certificate(s)
representing Common Stock or Preferred Stock held by a Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time are not surrendered at the Closing as
provided in Section 2.3(a), after the Effective Time, the Buyer will deliver
(or cause to be delivered) to such Stockholder the certificate representing
Buyer Common Stock referred to in clause (i) of Section 2.3(b) at such time
as such Company Stockholder surrenders and delivers to the Buyer
such certificate(s) and the other documents required to be surrendered
and delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a).   2.4 Closing of Company Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall

No Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates
representing Common Stock or Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 2.3,
and no fractional interest shall entitle a Company Stockholder to vote or to
any rights of a security holder. In lieu of fractional shares, each Company
Stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of
Buyer Common Stock, will receive, upon the surrender and delivery by such
Company Stockholder of the certificate(s) and other documents required to be
surrendered and delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(a), an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by $84.5705.  
2.6 No Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
neither the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer\'s transfer agent nor
any other Person shall be liable for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  
2.7 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by Company
Stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who shall not
have withdrawn such demand or otherwise have forfeited appraisal rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such Company
Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Common Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Common Stock
under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 2.3(a), of the certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of
Common Stock and the delivery of the other documents required to be
delivered pursuant to such Section 2.3.   (b) The Company shall give the
Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or offer
to settle, or settle, any such demands.    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS

Returns were and are true, complete and correct. No claim has been made by a
Taxing Authority (as defined below), in a jurisdiction where the Company does
not file Tax Returns to the effect that the Company is or may be subject to

Taxes (as defined below) that are due and payable by it.   (c) Tax
Reserves. The total of the accrual and reserves for Taxes (excluding deferred

been initiated. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no deficiency for any Taxes has
been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company that has not
been resolved and paid in full. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no facts exist
that would be reasonably likely to result in the assessment of any
material liability for Taxes against the Company for any prior periods for

Administrative and Court Proceedings. No audits or other proceedings by any
Taxing Authority are presently pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

relating to Taxes; and "Closing Agreement" shall mean a written and legally
binding agreement with a Taxing Authority relating to Taxes.   (k)

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Buyer and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
properties requires such qualification, except for failures, if any, to be so

would not reasonably be likely to, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. The
Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as now being and as heretofore conducted.   4.2
Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Buyer consists

and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no shares of Buyer Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding. No material change in such capitalization has occurred between

hereby (and, in the case of the Buyer, thereby) have been duly authorized by
the boards of directors of the Buyer and Sub and by the Buyer as the sole
stockholder of Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Buyer and Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or for the Buyer or
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Buyer and Sub and constitutes (and,
the Escrow Agreement when executed and delivered by the Buyer, will
constitute) the valid and binding obligation of the Buyer and Sub (in the
case of Sub, solely with respect to this Agreement), enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors\' rights generally or to general principles of equity.   (b)
Assuming effectuation of all filings and registrations with, termination or
expiration of any applicable waiting periods imposed by and receipt of all

the Buyer, the execution and delivery by the Buyer of the Escrow Agreement
will not), the performance by each of the Buyer and Sub of its obligations
hereunder (and, in the case of the Buyer, thereunder) and the consummation by
each of the Buyer and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby (and in the
case of the Buyer, thereby) will not, (i) conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of any provision of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Buyer or the certificate
of incorporation of Sub, the by-laws of the Buyer or the by-laws of Sub,
(ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of
any benefit) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to which the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their properties or assets may be bound or (iii) conflict with or violate
any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets, except, in
the case of (ii) and (iii), for any such violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or conflicts which would
not, in the aggregate, have or result in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.  
(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, is required by or with
respect to the Buyer or Sub in connection with the execution and delivery by
the Buyer or Sub of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the performance

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required

filings which, if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or be reasonably likely to have, a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.   4.4 Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) The Buyer has
filed with the SEC all reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act
since October 22, 1999 and has made available to the Company all registration
statements, prospectuses, reports and documents filed by the Buyer with the
SEC since January 29, 2000 (collectively, the "Buyer SEC Reports"). The Buyer
SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Buyer
SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements in such Buyer
SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case, any related notes) contained in the
Buyer SEC Reports, complied, as of their respective dates, in all material
respects with all applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved and fairly presented the consolidated financial position of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, subject
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements to normal recurring
year-end adjustments that are not likely to be material in amount and the
absence of notes.   4.5 Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The information to be
supplied by the Buyer for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
not, on the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed or
otherwise provided to stockholders of the Company and the Buyer, or at the
Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus not false
or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies which has

adviser or similar intermediary on behalf of the Buyer in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and there are

Buyer shall file with the SEC, the Registration Statement and the

comments of the SEC and shall cause the Registration Statement to become

by the Buyer and its counsel, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to
the Company, the Buyer, Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors should be discovered by such party which should be set forth in
an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such
party shall promptly inform the other thereof and take appropriate action

and adopting this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-
laws, as promptly as practicable following the effectiveness of the

stockholders required by the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation and
the By-laws to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Buyer and the Company shall
prepare and file as promptly as practicable any such other filings under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the DGCL as may be required to effectuate
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that the Company secures the written consent of the Company

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall
promptly provide such notice to holders of shares of Company Stock entitled
to appraisal rights as required by the DGCL.   (c) The Buyer shall use all
reasonable efforts to take any action required to be taken under state

reasonable access to all its properties, plants, personnel, books, contracts,
commitments and records (other than privileged documents) and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may reasonably request during such period. During such period, each
party will hold any such information which is non-public in confidence in
accordance with the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated April 18, 2000, as
amended on May 27, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Buyer
and the Company. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.  
6.4 Supplements to Disclosure Schedule. From time to time prior to the
Closing, the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer and thereafter
promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any
matter hereafter arising which, if existing or occurring at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedule. No supplement or amendment of the Disclosure Schedule
made pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to cure any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, or shall be taken into
account in determining whether the condition to Closing set forth in Section
7.2(a) hereof is satisfied as of the Closing Date, unless the Buyer
specifically agrees thereto in writing.   6.5 Legal Conditions to Merger;
Taking of Necessary Action. Each of the Buyer and the Company will take all
reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on either party with respect to the Merger (which
actions shall include, without limitation, furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act or in connection with approvals of or filings with
any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and
furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements
imposed upon either of them in connection with the Merger. Each of the Buyer
and the Company will take (or cause to be taken) all reasonable
actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining)
any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by the Buyer or
the Company in connection with the Merger or the taking of any
action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.6 Listing of Buyer Shares. The Buyer
shall use reasonable efforts to have authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of Buyer Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger and to be issued upon exercise of any Option
assumed by the Buyer pursuant to Section 6.7.   6.7 Company Stock Plan. At
the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plan and each then outstanding Option,
whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by the Buyer and become and
represent an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (including,
without limitation, vesting provisions and repurchase provisions regarding
any shares of restricted stock) as were applicable to such Option prior to
the Effective Time, a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole number) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares
of Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (ii) the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share
of Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by the Common Stock Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of
the parties hereto that each Option so assumed by the Buyer will, to the
extent permitted by applicable laws, qualify as an "incentive stock option"
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Option
qualified as such immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer will deliver to each Person
who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of an
outstanding Option, an instrument evidencing the assumption of such Option by
the Buyer as provided in this Section 6.7. The Buyer will take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Options assumed by the
Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.7. The Buyer will use reasonable efforts
to cause the issuance of shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of any Options to have been registered as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time pursuant to an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so
long as any of such Options remain outstanding.   6.8 Consents. Each of the
Buyer and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Buyer\'s or the Company\'s
material agreements, contracts, licenses, leases or commitments in connection
with the Merger.   6.9 Further Action. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable and available to
a party to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either of Sub or the Company, each
party to this Agreement shall take or cause to be taken all such action.  
6.10 Financial Statement Preparation and Review. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause its respective
management and independent auditors to facilitate on a timely basis (i) the
preparation of financial statements (including pro forma financial statements
to be prepared by the Buyer, if required) to comply or enable the Buyer to
comply with applicable SEC regulations, (ii) the review of any audit or
review work papers including the examination of selected audited financial
statements and data and (iii) the delivery of such representations from each
party\'s independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by the other
party or its accountants. The Company will obtain a SAS 71 review of its
unaudited financial statements as of April 30, 2000 and for the four months
then ended and any subsequent interim financial statements prior to the
Effective Time and provide copies thereof to Buyer prior to the filing of the
Registration Statement.    6.11 Company Director and Officer
Indemnification; Insurance.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the
Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of
the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time to the extent provided under the Certificate of Incorporation
and the By-laws, in each case as in effect on the date hereof; provided that
such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time
to time under applicable law and shall not be available with respect to
an action initiated by an indemnification party (other than an action
to enforce this provision); and provided further that indemnification by
the Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be provided only to the
extent any directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy of the
Company does not provide coverage and actual payment. From the Effective Time
and for a period of four years thereafter, the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions
providing rights to liability limitation, exculpation and indemnification in
favor of the employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company at least
as favorable as those currently included in the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws as in effect on the date hereof.   (b) The
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than four years after the
Effective Time the policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date hereof for the benefit of those
persons covered by such policies as of the date hereof with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time; provided, however, that
(i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured persons with an insurance company or companies,
the claims paying ability of which is substantially equivalent to the claims
paying ability of the insurance company or companies providing such insurance
coverage as of the date hereof for directors and officers of the Company and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of two times the last annual premium paid prior
to the date hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
possible for two times the last annual premium.   6.12 Tax Treatment. From
and after the date of this Agreement, each Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and shall not knowingly take actions
or cause actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code.   6.13 Agreements with Respect to Affiliates.   (a) The Company will
cause each person who is identified in Section 3.29 of the Disclosure
Schedule and any other person who, to the Knowledge of the Company, is or
becomes an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145") to deliver to the Buyer, as soon as practicable
but not later than thirty days after the date hereof, a written agreement (a
"Company Affiliate Agreement") in connection with restrictions on affiliates
under Rule 145 and pooling of interests accounting treatment, substantially
in the form of Exhibit A hereto. The Company shall provide prompt notice to
the Buyer of any such other person who, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
or becomes an "affiliate" of the Company who is not identified in Section
3.29 of the Disclosure Schedule.   (b) The Buyer will cause each person
who, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, is or may become an "affiliate" of the
Buyer for purposes of Rule 145, excluding all Subsidiaries of the Buyer, to
deliver to Buyer, a written agreement in connection with restrictions on
affiliates under pooling of interests accounting treatment, substantially in
the form of Exhibit B hereto.   6.14 Pooling Accounting. The Buyer and the
Company shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the business
combination to be effected by the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes. Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall
knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, that would
be reasonably likely to jeopardize the treatment of the Merger as a pooling
of interests for accounting purposes. The Buyer and the Company will use all
reasonable efforts to prevent any affiliate of such party from taking any
actions which could prevent the Merger from being treated for financial
accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests". Each of the Buyer and the
Company agrees to take such action as may be reasonably required to negate
the impact of any past actions which to its knowledge could be
reasonably likely to jeopardize the treatment of the Merger as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes.   6.15 Letters of Company Accountants.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the Buyer (i) a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company\'s
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date
on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to
the Buyer, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and
customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent
public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement, which letter shall be brought down to the Effective
Time, and (ii) the letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP referred to in
Section 7.2(i).   6.16 Employee Matters.   (a) Employees of the Company
whose employment with the Company is continued by the Buyer, or who are
retained as employees of the Buyer, after the Effective Time, will receive
salary and benefits consistent with the Buyer\'s practices and policies in
effect from time to time.   (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
take all necessary and appropriate action so that no amount payable under
any Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement or otherwise will fail to
be deductible by the Company, Sub or the Buyer for U.S. federal income
tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code.   (c) The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from (i) each consultant (and each
employee who formerly was a consultant) a waiver to the effect that all work
of such Person for the Company will be deemed to be "work-for-hire" and (ii)
a royalty-free license to use any prior invention of any employee or
consultant that is incorporated into a product of the Company.   6.17
Ancillary Agreements. Concurrently with the Closing, the Buyer and the
Stockholder Representative will execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement.  
6.18 Takeover Statutes. If any takeover statute is or may become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company Board will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
the effects of any takeover statute on any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   6.19 Employees. From and after the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall continue to employ individuals who are employed by the Company as
of the Effective Time who remain employed with the Buyer (the
"Affected Employees") at their salaries as in effect prior to the date
hereof. The Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time the Affected Employees, provided
they meet applicable eligibility requirements, are provided the opportunity
to participate in the Buyer\'s employee benefit plans, programs, policies
or arrangements that the Buyer provided to employees of the Buyer in
positions comparable to positions held by Affected Employees with the Buyer
as of the Effective Time.   6.20 Alternative Transaction Structures. The
Buyer and the Company hereby acknowledge their mutual intent and agreement to
further consider following the date hereof alternative transaction structures
and registration procedures, including the delivery of the Merger
Consideration to the Company Stockholders in a manner which would not
require registration under the Securities Act, with the commitment of the
Buyer to register the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger subsequent to the Effective Time. The Company and the Buyer will use
their reasonable efforts to reach agreement as to any such alternative
structures or procedures which may be proposed and to negotiate an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement to effectuate the same.   6.21
Working Capital Loan. In the event that prior to the Effective Time the cash
balances of the Company shall be reduced to less than $5 million, provided
that the Company\'s expenditures have been in the ordinary course of business
and the Company is not otherwise in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, the Buyer agrees
to extend to the Company a working capital loan of up to $15 million (with
take downs in increments of $5 million) which would be subordinate to the
Company\'s existing bank borrowings and otherwise on commercially reasonable
terms.    ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO MERGER   7.1 Conditions to Each

the Company in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time until the
earlier to occur of (i) 5:00 p.m., Boston time, on the first anniversary of
the Effective Time or (ii) the date of issuance of the first independent
audit report on the Buyer\'s annual financial statements after the Effective
Time, which annual financial statements include the financial results of the
Company.   (b) No investigation by, or furnishing of information to, the
Buyer shall affect the right of the Buyer to rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company set forth herein.   8.2
Company Stockholder Obligation to Indemnify.   (a) After the Effective Time,
subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.3, the Company Stockholders shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and assigns (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") from and against all losses, liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, costs or expenses, including interest and penalties
imposed or assessed by any judicial or administrative body and
reasonable attorneys\' fees, whether or not arising out of third-party claims
and including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of
the foregoing, net of any actual recoveries under existing insurance
policies, amounts actually received pursuant to indemnification from third
parties or in the case of third party claims, by any amount actually
recovered by the party or parties seeking indemnification or their Affiliates
pursuant to counterclaims made by any of them directly relating to facts
giving rise to such third-party claims (collectively, "Losses"), suffered or
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Person based upon, arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty (for purposes of this Section 8.2, disregarding, in determining
the existence of a misrepresentation or breach of warranty, any requirement
in a representation or warranty that an event or fact be material or have,
or be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, in order for
such event or fact to constitute a misrepresentation or breach of warranty),
or any breach of any covenant or agreement, of the Company in this
Agreement or any certificate of the Company delivered pursuant to the terms
hereof.   (b) No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section
8.2(a) with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty or breach of any covenant or agreement after termination thereof in
accordance with Section 8.1, except with respect to claims made prior to such
termination pursuant to Section 8.5 but not then resolved (such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement surviving with respect to
such claim until resolution of such claim).   (c) The terms and conditions
of this Article VIII constitute essential terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Merger, and approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders shall constitute the express agreement of each Company
Stockholder with respect to (i) the obligations of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to this Article VIII and (ii) the appointment of G. Felda Hardymon
to act as the representative of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Without
limitation of the foregoing, as an essential term of this Agreement and the
Merger, the Company Stockholders acknowledge that their indemnification
obligations are solely in their capacity as former stockholders of the
Company, and, accordingly, an obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall not itself cause any current or
former officer, director, employee or agent of the Company to be entitled to
any indemnification from the Company pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-laws or any agreement with the Company.   8.3
Limitations on Company Stockholder Indemnification.   (a) The limitations of
Sections 8.2(b), 8.3(b), 8.3(c), 8.3(d) and 8.3(e) shall not apply in the
case of a fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the liability of any Company
Stockholder exceed the value of the Merger Shares paid to such Company
Stockholder in the Merger, including the value of the Escrow Shares included
in Merger Shares paid to such Company Stockholder in the Merger.   (b) The
Company Stockholders shall have no indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 8.2 unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or
suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Persons exceeds $1,000,000, after which,
subject to Sections 8.3(c) and 8.3(d), the obligation of the Company
Stockholders shall be to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for the
entire amount of such Losses (including such initial $1,000,000).   (c) The
indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section
8.2 shall be several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective
Ownership Percentage Interests as set forth on the Closing Stockholder
Schedule referred to in Section 2.1(g).   (d) The Escrow Shares shall be the
sole and exclusive recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Persons to satisfy the
indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section
8.2(a), and the Company Stockholders shall have no further obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 8.2(a) after all
the Escrow Shares have been redelivered to the Buyer pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. For purposes of satisfying the indemnification obligations of the
Company stockholders, the Escrow Shares shall be valued at $84.5705 per
share, subject to appropriate adjustment for splits, combinations and the
like affecting Buyer Common Stock.   (e) After the Effective Time, subject
to Section 8.3(a), this Article VIII shall set forth the sole and exclusive
remedy and recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
contained herein.   8.4 Nonsurvival of Buyer Obligations. The
representations and warranties of the Buyer in this Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time.   8.5
Procedures Relating to Indemnification.   (a) An indemnified person or
entity under Section 8.2 (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written
notice to the Stockholder Representative (as defined in Section 8.6), as
agent for the Company Stockholders, with a copy to the Escrow Agent of any
claim or event known to it which gives rise or, in its reasonable judgment,
may give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder by the Indemnified
Party against the Company Stockholders; provided that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this Section 8.5 shall not
relieve the Company Stockholders of their obligations under this Article
VIII, except to the extent that such failure has materially and adversely
affected the rights of the Company Stockholders. In the case of any claim for
indemnification hereunder arising out of a claim, action, suit or proceeding
brought by any person who is not a Party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall also give the Stockholder
Representative, as agent for the Company Stockholders, copies of any written
claims, process or legal pleadings with respect to such Third-Party Claim
promptly after such documents are received by the Indemnified Party.   (b)
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) below, the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that the Stockholder Representative, as agent for the Company
Stockholders, may elect, at the Company Stockholders\' own cost and expense,
to participate in any Third-Party Claim; provided further, however, that
neither the Stockholder Representative nor any Company Stockholder shall take
any action with respect to such Third-Party Claim before consulting with, and
receiving the consent of, each Indemnified Party involved. If the
Stockholder Representative, as agent for the Company Stockholders, elects
to participate in a Third-Party Claim, the Stockholder Representative
shall, within 30 days of its receipt of the notice provided pursuant to
Section 8.5(a) hereof (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim
so requires), notify the related Indemnified Party of its intent to do so.
The Stockholder Representative and each Company Stockholder shall
reasonably cooperate in the compromise of, or defense against, such Third-
Party Claim. The Company Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of
each Indemnified Party\'s costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such cooperation, and such expenses shall constitute Losses incurred or
suffered by the Buyer within the meaning of Section 8.2 hereof. The
Indemnified Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative, as agent for the Company Stockholders, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   (c) If the Indemnified Party
elects not to compromise or defend against a Third-Party Claim, the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders shall pay,
compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim at the Company Stockholders own
cost and expense. The Stockholder Representative shall, within thirty days
(or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to pay, compromise or defend such Third-Party
Claim, and such Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in the
compromise of, or defense against, such Third-Party Claim. The Company
Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment of the Indemnified
Parties\' costs and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation,
and such costs and expenses shall constitute Losses incurred or suffered by
the Buyer within the meaning of Section 8.2 hereof. Neither the Stockholder
Representative nor any Company Stockholder shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of
each related Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), unless such judgment or settlement provides solely for money
Losses or other money payments for which such Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder and includes as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim; provided
that the Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to settle any
claim, action, suit or proceeding brought by a Taxing Authority in respect
of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period that would have the effect of
materially decreasing the Company\'s deductions for credits or materially
increasing the Company\'s taxable income for any taxable year or period
subsequent to the Pre-Closing Period without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from
the Stockholder Representative, as agent for the Company Stockholders, to
an Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Company Stockholders shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party under this Article VIII for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;
provided that such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ one
counsel of its choice to represent such Indemnified Party if, in such
Indemnified Party\'s reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest between
such Indemnified Party and the Company Stockholders exists in respect of
such claim, or if there is a reasonable likelihood that a Third-Party Claim
may have a material adverse effect on an Indemnified Party, and in that
event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be
the responsibility of the Company Stockholders (and shall constitute
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer within the meaning of Section
8.2(a) hereof).   8.6 Stockholder Representative.   (a) In order to
administer the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, including the indemnification obligations of the Company
Stockholders under this Article VIII, the Company Stockholders hereby
designate and appoint G. Felda Hardymon as their sole and exclusive
representative for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and as
attorneys-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each Company Stockholder (in
such capacity, the "Stockholder Representative"), and G. Felda Hardymon
accepts such appointment as Stockholder Representative.   (b) The Company
Stockholders hereby authorize the Stockholder Representative to represent the
