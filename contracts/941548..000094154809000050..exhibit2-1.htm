prior to the Effective Time in connection with Company Stock Options) shall
be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid
and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent
Stock Consideration") equal to the Exchange Ratio. "Exchange Ratio"
means 1.185. The Parent Stock Consideration using the Exchange Ratio
shall be calculated to the nearest one-ten thousandth of a share of
Parent Stock. The Parent Stock Consideration to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock hereunder (together with the cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock as specified below) is referred to herein
as the "Merger Consideration."

 

 

(B) Each share of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist and shall no
longer be outstanding; each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any such shares (other than shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(ii)) shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor and the holder of any
Company Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
provided in Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section
2.5(c)), without interest, upon the surrender of such Company Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.5(b).

 

 

(ii) Company Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any
holder thereof, all shares of Company Common Stock that are held immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Company, by Parent or Merger Sub or by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be
cancelled and retired without any conversion and shall cease to exist, and no
Merger Consideration shall be paid or payable in exchange therefor.

 

 

(iii) Company Stock Options.

 

 

(A) At the Effective Time, Company Stock Options granted to holders that are
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall assume each such Company Stock Option (hereinafter an "Assumed
Option") subject to the terms of the applicable Company Incentive Plan and
stock option award agreement; provided, however, that the (1) number of
shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon such exercise of such Assumed
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock
that were purchasable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the
nearest whole share, and (2) the per share exercise price under such Assumed
Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest whole cent, each in compliance with the
"ratio test" and the "spread test" of the Treasury Regulations under Section
424 of the Internal Revenue Code. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Incentive Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions and the Company Board (or any such committee) and the Company
shall take such other actions as may be required to effect the provisions of
the preceding sentence and to provide for the full vesting of Assumed Options
to the extent provided in Section 2.4(c)(iii)(B). At the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume the Company Incentive Plans with such amendments thereto
as may be required to reflect the Merger, including the substitution of
Parent Common Stock for Company Common Stock thereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
adjustment pursuant to Parent's assumption of the Company Stock Options shall
be determined in a manner so the Assumed Option will be exempt from Code
Section 409A and the Parties to this Agreement shall agree to any adjustments
to the foregoing to comply therewith. All Assumed Options shall be fully
vested; provided that each Assumed Option that is attributable to a Company
Stock Option issued after the date hereof pursuant to Section
5.2(a)(iv) shall provide the holder with the same vesting rights that were
included in such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option that
becomes an Assumed Option shall have any right to receive any shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of such option or any Merger Consideration.

 

 

(iv) Company Restricted Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
share of Company Common Stock then outstanding that is unvested or is subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition or restriction
under any Company Incentive Plans or any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company ("Company
Restricted Stock") shall be immediately vested and become free of such
conditions or restrictions and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Company Certificate(s)
representing such shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent;
provided that each share of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for each
such outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is attributable to a
grant issued after the date hereof pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(iv) shall
provide the holder with the same vesting, repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition or restriction that were applicable to
such Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(v) Certain Adjustments. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, regardless of whether permitted pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the outstanding Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall
be changed into a different number or type of securities by reason of any
stock split, combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization or other
similar transaction, or any distribution of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall be declared with a record date within such period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Restricted Stock with the same
economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect
to such event.

Section 2.5  Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent selected by Parent that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), and enter into an exchange agent agreement,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such
Exchange Agent to act as agent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of Company Certificates upon surrender of such Company Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article 2
from time to time after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Securities, (i) Parent Certificates representing
shares of Parent Stock Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section
2.4(c)(i) and Section 2.4(c)(iv) and delivered pursuant to Section
2.5(b) and (ii) cash for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.5(e). Such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
interest, dividends or distributions with respect thereto (as provided in
Section 2.5(c)) and such cash, are referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund."
The Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the
terms of this Agreement given on the Closing Date, shall deliver the Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) and Section
2.4(c)(iv) as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.5(e) out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose whatsoever; provided that the Exchange Agent shall invest
or hold the cash portion of the Exchange Fund only in cash or direct, short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in each case
as directed by Parent and acceptable to the Exchange Agent; provided,
however, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of the Company Securities and following
any losses, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Company Securities in the amount
of any such losses to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration to
such holders. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise
any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock held by it
from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto
after the establishment of such Exchange Fund for the account of Persons
entitled thereto.

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures.

 

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company
Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares
of Company Common Stock, a letter of transmittal (in customary form and
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to be used to effect the exchange of
such Company Certificate for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate,
along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to effect such
exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto) shall
specify that delivery of any Company Certificate shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title thereto shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent. Such letter of transmittal shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other documents that may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent: (A) the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, and that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) and Section 2.4(c)(iv), any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided
in Section 2.5(e), and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (all after giving
effect to any required withholding of Taxes); and (B) the Company Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company
Certificates.

 

 

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions that such holder has the right to receive under this Agreement)
may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid.

 

 

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b), each Company
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender of a Company Certificate
and execution of such other documents as the Exchange Agent may require, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Company Certificate as provided in Section
2.4(c)(i) and Section 2.4(c)(iv) (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions payable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement).

 

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the
Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable Law: (i) at the time of the surrender of a Company Certificate
for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5, there
shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount
of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective
Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to
surrender) not theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount
of any withholding Taxes that may be required with respect thereto); and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date and without duplicating any payment made
under clause (i) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder,
without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a
record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less the
amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required with respect thereto).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions
payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and, from and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a Company Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Section 2.5.

 

 

(e) Treatment of Fractional Shares. No Parent Certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger and, except as provided in this Section 2.5(e), no dividend or other
distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any such fractional
share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Certificates
delivered by or on behalf of such holder), such holder, upon surrender of a
Company Certificate as described in this Section 2.5, shall be paid an amount
in cash to the nearest whole cent (without interest) determined by
multiplying (i) the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, in addition to any other cash being provided to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(a), the amount of cash necessary to make such
payments.

 

 

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund and cash
held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.5
that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company as of the
date that is twelve months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of the Company, who
have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (all without interest).

 

 

(g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

 

(h) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Company Certificates. If any Company
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or
the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claims that may be
made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate the Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c), without interest)
deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2.6  Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at
the offices of Porter and Hedges, L.L.P., 1000 Main Street, 36th
Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 at 10:00 a.m., local time, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than the third Business Day immediately
following the day on which all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 have
been satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to waive the condition)
(except for those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
or (b) at such other time, date or place as the Parties may agree. The date
on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the
"Closing Date."

 

 

Section 2.7  Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective (the "Effective Time") at the time the Certificate of Merger is
accepted for filing by the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such time
thereafter as is permitted by law, agreed by the Parties and provided in the
Certificate of Merger. At the Closing, the Certificate of Merger shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

 

 

Section 2.8  Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
under the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment (including withholding
shares of Parent Common Stock). Any such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

 

Section 2.9  Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Code, and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local
Law, that each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company is "a party to the
reorganization" pursuant to Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and
that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

 

 

Article 3

 

 

Representations and Warranties of the Company

 

 

As an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the
Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Parent
and Merger Sub; provided, however, that such representations and warranties
shall be subject to and qualified by (a) the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent as of the date hereof (each Section of which qualifies
the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein) (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (it being
understood that (i) the disclosure of any fact or item in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall, should the existence of such fact or item be
relevant to any other Section, be deemed to be disclosed with respect to that
other Section to the extent that the text of such disclosure is made in a
manner that makes its relevance to the other Section reasonably apparent and
(ii) the disclosure of any matter or item in the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such matter or item
is required to be disclosed therein or is material to a representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement and shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or any word or phrase of similar import and does not
mean that such matter or item, alone or together with any other matter or
item, would constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect) and (b) information
contained in the Company Reports (excluding any exhibits thereto) filed with
the SEC prior to the date hereof (but only to the extent that such disclosure
on its face appears to constitute information that could reasonably be deemed
a qualification or exception to the following representations and warranties;
provided, that in no event shall any disclosure in such Company Reports
qualify or limit the representations and warranties in Section 3.2, Section
3.3, Section 3.7(a), Section 3.16, Section 3.17, Section 3.18, Section
3.19 and Section 3.22):

Section 3.1  Corporate Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority.
The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly
qualified to conduct business and is in good standing (to the extent such
concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership, operation or lease of its property or the nature of the
Company's business requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in
which any failures to be so qualified or to be in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
currently being conducted. The Company has delivered to Parent true, accurate
and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended
and Restated By-laws of the Company, each as amended to date (the "Company

Charter Documents.

other transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, subject to the
approval of the Company Proposal by the Company's stockholders. The

requisite corporate action on behalf of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings by the Company are necessary to authorize the execution and

Documents, except for the approval of the Company Proposal by the Company's
stockholders, the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL
and the Governmental Authority applications and approvals described
in Section 3.6(b).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) This Agreement and each of the Related Documents to which the Company is
a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof and thereof by
Parent and Merger Sub to the extent either Parent or Merger Sub is a party
hereof and thereof, constitute or will constitute the valid and legally
binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other Laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. As

Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding or authorized Equity Interests.
All shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares of Company Common
Stock which may be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time as permitted under this Agreement shall be when issued, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock
and not subject to any preemptive rights. Each share of Company Common Stock
includes one preferred stock purchase right; each such right is issued
pursuant to the Company Rights Plan.

 

 

(b) The Company has no outstanding Voting Debt. Except as set forth in
Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not obligated to issue, sell, grant or deliver (or to cause
to be issued, sold, granted or delivered), and are not a party to any
Contract or other obligation to issue, sell, grant or deliver, any Voting
Debt of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding or

(a) Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized or constituted and validly existing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, organization or formation. Each Company
Subsidiary has all requisite corporate, limited liability company,
partnership or other business power and authority to own or lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except as would have an immaterial effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
conduct business and is in good standing (to the extent such concept exists
in the relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or
lease and operation of its property or the nature of its business requires
such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which any failures to be so
qualified or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, do not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, each Company Subsidiary are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens.

(b) Section 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and Exhibit 21.1 of the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2008, sets forth all of the Company Subsidiaries. The Company's U.S.
Subsidiaries are not in violation of their respective Company Subsidiary
Charter Documents, and the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries are not in
material violation of their respective Company Subsidiary Charter Documents.

individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and except for (x) matters relating to Taxes, which are
treated exclusively in Section 3.10, and (y) matters relating to Company

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary hold all permits, licenses,
certifications, variations, exemptions, Orders, franchises, registrations,
filings, approvals, authorizations or other required grant of operating
authority required by any Governmental Authority necessary for the conduct of
their respective businesses (the "Company Permits"). All Company Permits are
in full force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach
thereof, and the Company has no notice or knowledge that such Company Permits
will not be renewed in the ordinary course after the Effective Time. No
Governmental Authority has given, or to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened to give, notice of any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
Company Permits; and

 

 

(c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary possess all Company Permits
required for the present ownership or lease, as the case may be, and

Section 3.7  SEC Documents.

 

 

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all documents required to be so filed
by it since January 1, 2007 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, and has made available to Parent each registration
statement, periodic or other report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form
(including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC
(collectively, the "Company Reports"). As used in this Section 3.7, the term
"file" shall include any reports on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC. As of its
respective date or, if amended by a subsequent filing prior to the
date hereof, on the date of such filing, each Company Report complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of the Company Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant
to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments to any comment letters received by the Company from the
SEC and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company Reports is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. Each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (such consolidated balance
sheets and consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows, each including the notes and schedules
thereto, the "Company Financial Statements"). The Company Financial
Statements (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC and (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted in the Company Financial Statements or as permitted by Form
10-Q or Form 8-K.

 

 

(b) The Company has not entered into or modified any loans or arrangements
with its officers and directors in violation of Section 402 of SOX. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of SOX. The management of the Company has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX
for the year ended December 31, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluations by its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer,
to the Company's outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses (as such terms
are defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing
Standard No. 2 or No. 5, as applicable) in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting and (B) any fraud, regardless of
whether material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

benefit plan. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA

respectively) from any multiemployer plan, no such liability has been
asserted, and there are no events or circumstances that could result in any
such partial or complete withdrawal. None of the Company, any of its

material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exists or
reasonably could be imposed upon the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of such International Plans, other than to the
extent reflected on the Company's balance sheet as contained in the Company's
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.

Common Stock in the Merger (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates) is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders, and the Company will promptly deliver a copy of
such opinion to Parent.

Law and the rules of the NYSE, the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Company Equity Interests necessary to approve the Company Proposal
is the affirmative vote in favor of the Company Proposal by the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Required Company Vote"). The Company Board has, by resolutions duly
adopted by the directors present at a meeting of such board duly called and
held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, unanimously (a)
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, (b) approved this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, (c) directed that this Agreement be
submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company and (d) recommended
that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any change in or modification or revocation of the
recommendation to the Company's stockholders of this Agreement by the Company
Board in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall not constitute a
breach of the representation set forth in clause (d) of this Section 3.19.

business consistent with past practices, the Company and its Subsidiaries do
not have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or
not required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to become due,
which individually or in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received written

compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with their respective obligations

amended or taken action under the Company Rights Agreement so that (i) none
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Related Document, the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or by
a Related Document, will cause the rights under the Company Rights Plans to
become exercisable under the Company Rights Agreement, and (ii) the rights
granted to any Person thereunder will expire immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Company has delivered to Parent a true, accurate and
complete copy of the Company Rights Agreement, as amended to date.

Article 4

 

 

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

 

 

As an inducement for the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally make the following representations
and warranties to the Company; provided, however, that such representations
and warranties shall be subject to and qualified by (a) the disclosure
schedule delivered by Parent to the Company as of the date hereof (each
Section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and
warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein) (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter") (it being understood that (i) the disclosure of any fact
or item in any Section of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall, should the
existence of such fact or item be relevant to any other Section, be deemed to
be disclosed with respect to that other Section to the extent that such
disclosure is made in a manner that makes its relevance to the other Section
reasonably apparent and (ii) the disclosure of any matter or item in the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment
that such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein or is material
to a representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement and shall not be
used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially,"
"materiality," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or any word or phrase of
similar import and does not mean that such matter or item, alone or together
with any other matter or item, would constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect) and (b) information contained in the Parent Reports (excluding any
exhibits thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof (but only to
the extent that such disclosure on its face appears to constitute information
that could reasonably be deemed a qualification or exception to the following
representations and warranties, provided, that in no event shall any
disclosure in such Parent Reports qualify or limit the representations and
warranties in Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.7(a), Section
4.9, Section 4.10 and Section 4.11):

 

 

Section 4.1  Corporate Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority.
Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Parent and Merger Sub are duly qualified to conduct
business and are in good standing (to the extent such concept exists in the
relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation
or lease of their respective properties or the nature of their respective
businesses requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which any
failures to be so qualified or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, do not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Merger Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
and operate their respective properties and assets and to carry on their
respective businesses as they are currently being conducted. Parent has
delivered to the Company true, accurate and complete copies of (a) the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Second Amended and
Restated By-laws of Parent, each as amended to date (the "Parent
Charter Documents"), and (b) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Merger Sub, each as amended to date (the "Merger Sub Charter Documents"),
and each Parent Charter Document and Merger Sub Charter Document is in full
force and effect, has not been amended or modified and has not been
terminated, superseded or revoked. Parent and Merger Sub are not in violation
of the Parent Charter Documents or Merger Sub Charter Documents,
as applicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 4.2  Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements.

execute and deliver this Agreement and the Related Documents to which they
are, or will become, a party, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Merger and all other
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, subject to the adoption
of this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related Documents and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder
and thereunder have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on
behalf of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings by Parent
and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Related Documents or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereunder or under the Related Documents, except
for the approval of this Agreement by the Parent as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL and
the Governmental Authority applications and approvals described in Section
5.8.

 

 

(b) This Agreement and each of the Related Documents to which Parent and/or
Merger Sub is a party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by
Parent and/or Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof and thereof by the Company to the extent the Company is a
party hereof and thereof, constitute or will constitute the valid and legally
binding obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent
and/or Merger Sub in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and
remedies of creditors generally and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at Law).

Parent Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Parent Preferred Stock. As of

the transactions contemplated hereunder. Merger Sub is and shall be at the
Effective Time a corporation wholly and directly owned by Parent.

 

 

Section 4.5  Compliance with Laws. Except for such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is in violation of any
applicable Law relating to its business or the ownership or operation of any
of its assets, and no Claim is pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened with respect to any such matters.

 

 

Section 4.6  No Violations; Consents. Neither the execution and delivery
by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement or any Related Document nor the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof will require any consent, approval or authorization
of, notice to or filing or registration with any Governmental Authority,
other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and the filing of other documents required to
be filed as a result of the Merger with the relevant Governmental Authorities
in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Subsidiary is qualified to conduct business, (ii) the filing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act

other applicable filings or notifications under the antitrust, competition or
similar Laws of foreign jurisdictions ((i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v)
collectively, the "Parent Regulatory Filings"), except for any failures to
obtain any such consent, approval or authorization or to make any such
filing, notification or registration that, individually or in the aggregate,
do not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.7 SEC Documents.

 

 

(a) Parent has filed with the SEC all documents required to be so filed by it
since January 1, 2007 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, and has made available to the Company each registration
statement, periodic or other report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form
(including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC
(collectively, the "Parent Reports"). As used in this Section 4.7, the term
"file" shall include any reports on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC. As of its
respective date, or, if amended by a subsequent filing prior to the
date hereof, on the date of such filing, each Parent Report complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. None of the Parent Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant
to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments to any comment letters received by the Parent from the
SEC and, to the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent Reports is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. Each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of its date, and each of the consolidated results of operations, changes
in stockholders' equity and cash flows included in or incorporated
by reference into the Parent Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders' equity, as the case may
be, of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (such
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated results of operations, changes
in stockholders' equity and cash flows, each including the notes and
schedules thereto, the "Parent Financial Statements"). The Parent Financial
Statements (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC and (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted in the Parent Financial Statements or as permitted by Form
10-Q or Form 8-K.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent has not entered into or modified any loans or arrangements with
its officers and directors in violation of Section 402 of SOX. Parent has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)
and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
SOX. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Parent's internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the year ended
December 31, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluations by its
chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, to Parent's outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) all significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses (as such terms are defined in the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 2 or No. 5, as
applicable) in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting and (B) any fraud, regardless of whether material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal controls over financial reporting.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Since January 1, 2007, to the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or Claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
Claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has a material weakness (as such
term is defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing
Standard No. 2 or No. 5, as applicable), in its internal control over
financial reporting.

 

 

(d) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with all current listing
and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE and is in compliance in all
material respects with all rules, regulations and requirements of SOX.

 

 

Section 4.8  Litigation.  There is no litigation, arbitration, mediation,
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation, whether legal or
administrative, pending against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
Parent's knowledge, threatened against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective assets, properties or operations, at Law or in
equity, before or by any Governmental Authority or any Order of any
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, there is no pending or, to the Parent's
knowledge, any threatened, litigation or other claim or demand against the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries relating to asbestos or mesothelioma.

 

 

Section 4.9  No Brokers. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
entered into any Contract with any Person that may result in the obligation
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to pay any finder's fees, brokerage or other like
payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Parent has
retained Simmons and Company International, Inc. as its financial advisor, the
fee and expense reimbursement arrangements with which have been disclosed in
writing to the Company prior to the date hereof.

 

 

Section 4.10  Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Parent Board has received
the opinion of Simmons and Company International, Inc. to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, qualifications
and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Parent, and Parent will promptly furnish a copy
of such opinion to the Company for informational purposes.

 

 

Section 4.11  No Parent Vote Required; Board of Director Approval.
Under Delaware Law and the rules of the NYSE, no vote of the holders of any
class or series of Parent Equity Interests is necessary to approve the Merger
and this Agreement. The Parent Board has, by resolutions duly adopted at
a meeting of the Parent Board, which meeting was duly called and held,
(a) determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of
Parent and its stockholders and (b) approved the Merger and this Agreement.
No stockholder vote is required for Merger Sub to adopt this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the vote of
Parent acting as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect to the foregoing), (i) no funds,
assets or properties of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been used
or offered for illegal purposes, (ii) none of the Parent or any of its

payment made to a Person would be, or has thereafter been, offered, given or
provided to any foreign official, political party or official thereof, or to
any candidate for public office.

representations and warranties contained in this Article 4, none of Parent,

Section 5.3  Access to Assets, Personnel and Information.

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
Parent shall: (i) afford to the Company and the Company Representatives, at
the Company's sole risk and expense, reasonable access during normal business
hours to any and all of the facilities and assets of the Parent Companies and
the books and records, files, data, correspondence, Contracts, permits,
audits and all other information relating to the Parent Companies' financial
position, business, employees, representatives, agents, facilities and
assets, whether written or computerized, that are within the possession or
control of any of the Parent Companies (the "Parent Information"); and (ii)
upon request during normal business hours, furnish promptly to the Company
(at the Company's expense), or similarly provide reasonable access to, a copy
of any Parent Information; provided, however, the Parent shall not be
required to provide the Parent Information to a materially greater extent
than was provided to the Company and the Company Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement, except if the Company requests Parent Information in
connection with any notice provided by Parent to the Company pursuant to
Section 5.11(b). The Company agrees to review such information in a manner
that does not interfere unreasonably with the Parent Companies' operations
and with the prompt discharge by such Parent Companies' employees of their
duties. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold the Parent
Companies harmless from any and all Claims and liabilities, including costs
and expenses for the loss, injury to or death of any Representative of the
Acquired Companies, and any loss or destruction of any property owned by the
Parent Companies or others (including Claims or liabilities for use of any
property) resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any
of the Acquired Companies or their Representatives during any visit to the
business or property of the Parent Companies prior to the completion of the
Merger, whether pursuant to this Section 5.3 or otherwise. No Parent Company
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose Parent Information
where such access or disclosure would constitute a violation of
attorney/client privilege, violate any Law or violate a Contract pursuant to
which any Parent Company is required to keep such information confidential.
In such circumstances, the Parties will use reasonable efforts to make
reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

(b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the
Company shall: (i) afford to Parent and the Parent Representatives,
at Parent's sole risk and expense, reasonable access during normal business
hours to any and all of the facilities and assets of the Acquired Companies
and the books and records, files, data, correspondence, Contracts, permits,
audits and all other information relating to the Acquired Companies'
financial position, business, employees, representatives, agents, facilities
and assets, whether written or computerized, that are within the possession
or control of any of the Acquired Companies (the "Company Information"); and
(ii) upon request during normal business hours, furnish promptly to Parent
(at Parent's expense), or similarly provide reasonable access to, a copy of
any Company Information. Parent agrees to review such information in a manner
that does not interfere unreasonably with the Acquired Companies' operations
and with the prompt discharge by such Acquired Companies' employees of their
duties. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold the Acquired Companies harmless
from any and all Claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for the
loss, injury to or death of any Representative of the Parent Companies, and
any loss of destruction of any property owned by the Acquired Companies or
others (including Claims or liabilities for use of any property) resulting
directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any of the Parent
Companies or their Representatives during any visit to the business or
property of the Acquired Companies prior to the completion of the
Merger, whether pursuant to this Section 5.3 or otherwise. None of the
Acquired Companies shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
Company Information where such access or disclosure would constitute a
violation of attorney/client privilege, violate any Law or violate a Contract
pursuant to which any Acquired Company is required to keep such information
confidential. In such circumstances, the Parties will use reasonable efforts
to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall: (i) furnish to the other, promptly upon receipt or filing (as
the case may be), a copy of each communication between such Party and the SEC
after the date hereof relating to the Merger or the Registration Statement
and each report, schedule, registration statement or other document filed by
such Party with the SEC after the date hereof relating to the Merger or the
Registration Statement, unless such communication, report, schedule,
registration statement or other document is otherwise readily available
through the SEC's EDGAR system, in which case Parent or the Company (as the
case may be) shall provide notice to the other of such availability; and (ii)
promptly advise the other of the substance of any oral communications between
such Party and the SEC relating to the Merger or the Registration Statement.

 

 

(d) The Company will not (and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives not to), and Parent will not (and will cause the
Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent Representatives not to), use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3 for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
information obtained by the Acquired Companies or Parent Companies or their
respective Representatives under this Section 5.3 shall be subject to the
confidentiality and use restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary: (i) the
Company shall not be obligated under the terms of this Section 5.3
to disclose to Parent or the Parent Representatives, or grant Parent or the
Parent Representatives access to, information that is within the possession
or control of any of the Acquired Companies but subject to a valid and
binding confidentiality agreement with a Third Party without first obtaining
the consent of such Third Party, and the Company, to the extent requested by
Parent, will use its reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent; and (ii)
Parent shall not be obligated under the terms of this Section 5.3
to disclose to the Company or the Company Representatives, or grant the
Company or the Company Representatives access to, information that is within
the possession or control of any of the Parent Companies but subject to a
valid and binding confidentiality agreement with a Third Party without first
obtaining the consent of such Third Party, and Parent, to the extent
requested by the Company, will use reasonable efforts to obtain any such
consent.

 

 

(f) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement, and no Party shall be
deemed to have made any representation or warranty to the other Party except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.4 No Solicitation.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(b), Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) and Section
5.4(g), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing non-public
information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition
Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto
(except to disclose the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.4)
or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly
facilitate any such inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or
negotiations, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement,
letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset
purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle requiring the
Company (whether or not subject to conditions) to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations
hereunder, (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation (individually or collectively a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (iv) take any action to exempt any
Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) from the restrictions
contained in any Takeover Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted theretofore by the Acquired Companies or any of its Representatives
with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly
cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information provided by or
on behalf of the Acquired Companies to any such Person.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Required Company Vote, (i) the Company has received a written, bona
fide Company Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that is not in violation
of such Third Party's contractual obligations to the Company, (ii) such
Company Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach or violation by the
Company of Section 5.4(a), (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside counsel,
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and (iv) after consultation with the
Company's outside counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, subject to
clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Acquired Companies to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives), and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that
(x) the Company will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose
any non-public information to such Person unless the Company has, or first
enters into, a customary confidentiality agreement with such Person with
terms no less favorable in all material respects to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the Company will promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) provide or make available to Parent or
its Representatives any non-public information concerning the Acquired
Companies provided or made available to such other Person which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives.

 

 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company (including
through any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives) receives (i) any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information which
relates to, or could reasonably likely lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) any request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly (and
in any event within such 48 hour period) with the identity of such Person and
a copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request (or, where such
Company Acquisition Proposal or request is not in writing, a description of
the material terms and conditions thereof). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a current basis (and in any
event no later than 48 hours after the occurrence of any material changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or request (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and of any material modification thereto). The Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict Company's
ability to provide such information to Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.4(a) to the contrary, if (i)
Company receives a written, bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal from a
Third Party that is not in violation of such Third Party's contractual
obligations to Company, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach or violation by the Company of Section 5.4(a), and (iii) the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and financial advisors, after giving effect to all of the adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent pursuant to
clause (B) below, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any time prior
to obtaining the Required Company Vote, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside counsel, that the failure to
take such action could reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law, (1) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (2) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h) and this Section 5.4(d), it being understood
that such termination shall not be effective unless, concurrently with such
termination, Company enters into a written definitive agreement for such
Company Superior Proposal and Company pays to Parent the Company Termination
Fee required to be paid under Section 7.3(c); provided, however, that the
Company Board may not effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) and this Section
5.4(d) unless (A) Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent,
at least three Business Days in advance (the "Company Notice Period"), of
its intention to take such action with respect to such Company Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Company Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Third Party
making such Company Superior Proposal) and, in the case of a proposed
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(h), shall include a copy of the proposed
definitive agreement to be entered into concurrently with and as a condition
to such termination, (B) prior to taking such action, the Company shall, and
shall direct its financial and legal advisors to, during such Company Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate in good faith) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, and (C) following any negotiation
described in the immediately preceding clause (B), the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal. In the event
of any revisions to the terms of a Company Superior Proposal that are
material to such Company Superior Proposal after the start of the Company
Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent satisfying the requirements of clause (A) of the preceding sentence
and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.4(d) with respect to
such new written notice, and the Company Notice Period shall be deemed to
have re-commenced on the date of such new notice.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.4(a) to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Company Board (i) determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside counsel, that the
failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change could reasonably
be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Company under applicable Law, and (ii) determines in good faith that the
reasons for making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change are the result
of a Company Intervening Event; provided, however, that the Company Board may
not effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section 5.4(e) unless (A) Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least three Business Days in advance, of its intention to make
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the
material facts and information constituting the basis for such contemplated
determination, and (B) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall, and shall direct its financial and legal advisors
to, during such three Business Day period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate in good faith) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement which would allow
the Company Board not to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change
consistent with its fiduciary duties.

 

 

(f) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4 by any of its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives,
including any violation by such a Representative of a direction given to such
Representative pursuant to the first sentence of Section 5.4(a) shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this Section 5.4) by the
Company.

 

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from (x) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (y) making any required disclosure to Company's stockholders if in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with Company's
outside counsel, failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to violate its obligations under applicable Law; provided that any
public disclosure relating or in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal
other than (A) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (B) an express
rejection of any applicable Company Acquisition Proposal, or (C) an express
reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the
Merger, shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change for
purposes of Section 7.1(g).

 

 

Section 5.5  Company Stockholder Meeting. Promptly after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company shall
take all necessary action, in accordance with applicable Law, the rules and
regulations of the NYSE and the Company Charter Documents (as the case may
be), to properly give notice of and hold a meeting of its stockholders for
the purpose of voting on the Company Proposal. Except in the event of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by Section
5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company
adopt the Company Proposal in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. Unless
this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or Parent in accordance
with its terms pursuant to Article 7 and except for disclosing a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company shall take all lawful action to solicit such approval,
including by timely mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of the Company, soliciting proxies in favor of the Company
Proposal and taking all other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Required Vote. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the timing of the stockholder meeting; provided,
however, that the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting (A) for
the absence of a quorum or (B) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company
believes in good faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Company's stockholders prior to the Company Meeting; provided, further, that
in the event that the Company Meeting is delayed to a date after the Outside
Date as a result of either (A) or (B) above, then the Outside Date shall be
extended to the fifth Business Day after such Company Meeting date.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to
Article 7, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for
approval regardless of whether the Company Board withdraws, modifies or
changes its recommendation and declaration regarding the Company Proposal.

Section 5.6  Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

 

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall file the
Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date
hereof and in any event not later than 60 days after the date hereof. Each
Party shall give the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior
to such documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to stockholders of
the Company and shall give the other Party and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional
information and comments from the SEC prior to their being filed with, or
sent to, the SEC. Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
filing. Parent and the Company will provide each other with any information
which may be required to prepare and file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
the Registration Statement. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
by the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event occurs which
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will as promptly as reasonably practicable inform the other of
such occurrence, and Parent and the Company will cooperate in filing such
amendment or supplement with the SEC, use reasonable efforts to cause such
amendment to become effective as promptly as possible and, if required, mail
such amendment or supplement to their respective stockholders.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent will cause the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the Company
shall be responsible for furnishing to Parent true, accurate and complete
information relating to the Company and holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Stock Options as is required to be included therein.

 

 

(c) The Company hereby covenants and agrees with Parent that: (i)
the Registration Statement (at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act through the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
(provided, however, that this clause (i) shall apply only to information
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement that was
supplied by the Company for inclusion therein); and (ii) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (at the time it is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company, at the time of the Company Meeting, and at the Effective Time) will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading (provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall apply only to
information included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that was supplied by the Company for inclusion therein).
If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to the
Company, or with respect to other information supplied by the Company
for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, occurs and such event is required to be described in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such
occurrence and shall cooperate with Parent in the preparation, filing an
dissemination of such amendment or supplement.

 

 

(d) Parent hereby covenants and agrees with the Company that: (i) the
Registration Statement (at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act and until the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (provided,
however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to any information included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement that was supplied by
the Company for inclusion therein); and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(at the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (provided, however,
that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any information included or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that was supplied
by the Company for inclusion therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to other information
included in the Registration Statement, occurs and such event is required to
be described in an amendment to the Registration Statement, such event shall
be so described and such amendment shall be promptly prepared and filed. If,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to Parent, or
with respect to other information included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
occurs and such event is required to be described in a supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such
occurrence and shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation, filing
and dissemination of such supplement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) None of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto will be filed or disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company without the approval of both Parent and the
Company. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective
under the Securities Act, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the
Registration Statement, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any comments or requests for additional information by
the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement.

 

 

(f) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to the Parent two comfort letters from KPMG LLP, Company's
independent auditors, one dated on the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective, and one bring-down letter dated on the
Closing Date, each addressed to the Parent and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent auditors in connection with
public offerings.

 

 

(g) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to the Company two comfort letters from Ernst and Young LLP, Parent's
independent auditors, one dated on the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective, and one bring-down letter dated on the
Closing Date, each addressed to the Company and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent auditors in connection with
public offerings.

 

 

Section 5.7  NYSE Listing. Parent shall prepare and submit to the NYSE, as
soon as practicable, a listing application covering the shares of Parent
Common Stock representing Parent Stock Consideration to be issued in the
Merger and shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective
Time, approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject to
official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with
respect to such listing, in order to facilitate obtaining such approval as
soon as practicable.

 

 

Section 5.8  Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents and Governmental Approvals.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company
and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and shall do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable under any
applicable Law (including the HSR Act) or under applicable Contracts so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable, including
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents
and approvals, remove all impediments to the Closing, and make all Parent
Regulatory Filings and Company Regulatory Filings (the "Regulatory
Filings"). Parent and the Company each will cause all documents it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Authority under this Section 5.8
to comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish the other Party with such
information and reasonable assistance as such other Party and its respective
Representatives may reasonably request in connection with their preparation
of any Regulatory Filings with any Governmental Authorities; provided,
however, that if the provisions of the HSR Act would prevent a Party from
disclosing such information to the other Party, then such information may be
disclosed to such Party's counsel.

 

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
action or shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or
desirable to cause the covenants and conditions applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby to be performed or satisfied as soon as
practicable, including responding promptly to requests for additional
information made by the DOJ or the FTC, and to cause the waiting periods
under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after
the date of filing.

 

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, Order,
ruling or injunction that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.
Furthermore, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued any Order,
decree, ruling or injunction, or taken any other action, that would have the
effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such
Order, decree, ruling or injunction or other action declared ineffective as
soon as practicable.

 

 

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other of any
communication concerning this Agreement or the Merger from any Governmental
Authority and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other Party to review in
advance any proposed communication to any Governmental Authority concerning
this Agreement or the Merger. In addition, Parent and Company shall not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or another inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger, or enter into any agreements with
any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, extending any
antitrust waiting periods, unless it consults with the other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Parent and the
Company shall furnish counsel to the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authorities or members
of their respective staffs on the other hand, relating to this Agreement and
the Merger.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as provided in Section 5.1
and Section 5.2, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so
as to require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, without its written consent, to sell, license,
dispose of, hold separate, or operate in any specified manner any assets or
businesses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
(or to require Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to any of the foregoing). The obligations
of each Party under this Section 5.8 to use reasonable best efforts with
respect to antitrust matters shall be limited to compliance with the
reporting provisions of the HSR Act and with its obligations under this
Section 5.8. In connection with its obligations under this Section 5.8,
the Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent, commit to (or
allow its Subsidiaries to commit to) any divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters, including covenants affecting
business operating practices in connection with the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.9  Section 16. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company
and their respective Boards of Directors shall adopt resolutions consistent
with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take any other actions as may
be required, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section 5.10  Public Announcements.

 

 

(a) On the date this Agreement is executed (or if executed after the close of
business, no later than the opening of the NYSE), Parent and the Company
shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution hereof and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as may be required by applicable
Law, Order or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body,
national securities exchange or association, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, making any other
public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) No Party shall issue any press release or other public statement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first
providing the other Parties with a written copy of the text of such release
or statement and obtaining the consent of the other Parties to such release
or statement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The consent
provided for in this Section 5.10(b) shall not be required if the delay
would preclude the timely issuance of a press release or public statement
required by Law or any applicable regulations. The provisions of this Section
5.10(b) shall not be construed as limiting the Parties from communications
consistent with the purposes of this Agreement, including but not limited to
seeking the regulatory and stockholder approvals contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.11  Notification of Certain Matters.

 

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub upon
obtaining knowledge of any of the following: (i) any representation or
warranty contained in Article 3 being untrue or inaccurate when made, (ii)
the occurrence of any event or development that would cause (or could
reasonably be expected to cause) any representation or warranty contained in
Article 3 to be untrue or inaccurate at any time on or before the Closing
Date, or (iii) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder.

 

 

(b) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon obtaining knowledge
of any of the following: (i) any representation or warranty contained in
Article 4 being untrue or inaccurate when made, (ii) the occurrence of any
event or development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to
cause) any representation or warranty contained in Article 4 to be untrue or
inaccurate at any time on or before the Closing Date, or (iii) any failure of
Parent to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.12 Payment of Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.3, each
Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering into and
carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether the Merger is
consummated, except that Parent and the Company shall equally share the
following: (i) all fees and expenses, other than attorneys', accountants',
financial advisors' and consultants' fees and expenses (which shall be paid
by the Party incurring same), incurred for printing the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, including preliminary materials related thereto, and
the Registration Statement, including financial statements and exhibits and
any amendments and supplements thereto, and (ii) the filing fees for the
Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act.

 

 

Section 5.13 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Company Charter Documents and Company Subsidiary Charter Documents in effect
as of the date hereof or in any indemnification agreements between the
Acquired Companies and their respective current or former directors,
officers, fiduciaries, agents or employees in effect as of the date hereof
(which have previously been provided to Parent). Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time,
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were current or former directors,
officers, agents, fiduciaries or employees of the Acquired Companies unless
such amendment, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law, and all
rights to indemnification thereunder in respect of any Claim asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition or resolution
of such Claim.

 

 

(b) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each person who is as of the date
hereof, has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or becomes prior to
the Effective Time a director, officer, fiduciary, agent or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such person, together with such
person's heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against
any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a "Claim"), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission in his or her capacity as such occurring or alleged to have occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time, including any act or omission in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Indemnified Party shall also be
entitled to advancement of expenses as incurred (and not later that ten
Business Days after receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
receipts therefor) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such advances if it
is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Claim for which indemnification could be sought by any
Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification shall promptly notify Parent thereof (provided that
failure to so notify Parent will not affect the obligations of Parent except
to the extent that Parent shall have been prejudiced as a result of such
failure) and shall deliver to Parent the undertaking contemplated by the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, but without any requirement for the
posting of a bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Claim is
brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Party will cooperate reasonably with
Parent, at Parent's expense, in the defense of such matter and (ii) Parent
shall have the right to control the defense of such matter and shall retain
only one set of legal counsel selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party (plus one local counsel, if necessary) to represent
all Indemnified Parties with respect to each such matter unless the use of
one counsel to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest, or the representation of all of the Indemnified
Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual differing
interests between them, in which case such additional counsel as may be
required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified Parties and
Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties. Parent shall pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of all such counsel for such
Indemnified Parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company's officers' and
directors' liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "DandO
Insurance"), for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or
officers from insurance carriers with financial strength ratings equal to or
greater than the financial strength rating of the Company's current insurance
carrier and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, further, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company in the aggregate for such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto;
and provided, further, that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain for such six year period as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount. If requested
in writing by the Company, Parent shall cause coverage to be extended under
the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six year "tail" policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the existing DandO Insurance, and such
"tail" insurance shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.13(c).

 

 

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

 

 

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.13 applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party.

 

 

Section 5.14  Employee Matters. Parent may, in its sole discretion,
continue any Company Benefit Plan or employee policy or program in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "Pre-Merger Plan"),
including a 401(k) plan or medical plan, for any period of time after the
Effective Time for the benefit of any Company Employees. To the extent Parent
does not continue a Pre-Merger Plan applicable to a Company Employee, such
Company Employee shall be eligible, subject to the provisions herein,
to participate in any corresponding Benefit Plan maintained by Parent
providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective Time (the
"Post-Merger Plans") to the extent such Post-Merger Plan replaces similar
coverage under such Pre-Merger Plan. To the extent permitted under such Post-
Merger Plans, Parent will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, give Company
Employees full credit under any such Post-Merger Plan for their years of
service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent
recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary under the corresponding
Pre-Merger Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (excluding vesting in equity based awards,
eligibility for post-employment welfare benefits and benefit accruals). The
value of the compensation and benefits provided under the Pre-Merger Plans or
the Post-Merger Plans, as applicable in accordance with the foregoing, to
Company Employees, taken as a whole, after the Effective Time through
December 31, 2009, shall be substantially similar to the value of
the compensation and benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans
(determined without regard to awards under the Company Incentive Plans) to
the Company Employees, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the Effective
time, as determined by Parent in good faith after taking into account all
facts and circumstances. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Post-Merger Plans to
the extent coverage under such Post-Merger Plan replaces coverage under
any Pre-Merger Plan; provided, however, to the extent such Company Employee
is not covered by a Pre-Merger Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time
due to failure to satisfy the applicable waiting period, such Company
Employee shall be subject to the waiting time applicable to a Parent employee
with respect to the corresponding Post-Merger Plan that replaces such Pre-
Merger Plan (giving full service credit for service by such Company
Employee with the Company in satisfying such waiting time); provided further,
to the extent a Company Employee is covered by a Pre-Merger Plan but does not
satisfy the service requirements for the corresponding Post-Merger Plan, the
Post-Merger Plan may allow such Company Employee to participate in such Post-
Merger Plan to the extent permitted under such Post-Merger Plan, as
determined in good faith by Parent, or Parent shall continue the Pre-Merger
Plan for such Company Employee or otherwise provide comparable substitute
coverage; and (ii) for purposes of each Post-Merger Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Post-Merger Plan to be waived for such employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions and requirements did
not apply to such individual under the corresponding Pre-Merger Plan and to
the extent permitted under the Post-Merger Plans or otherwise required by
applicable Law, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Pre-Merger Plan ending on the date such employee's participation
in the corresponding Post-Merger Plan begins to be taken into account under
such Post-Merger Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such Post-Merger Plan. Nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any Benefit
Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. No Company Employee or any other Person (other
than the parties to this Agreement) is intended to be a beneficiary of the
provisions of this Section 5.14.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.15 Company Board and Executive Officers. At or prior to Closing,
unless otherwise notified in writing by Parent, the Company shall deliver to
Parent written resignations of all members of the Company Board and all
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be effective as of
the Effective Time.

 

 

Section 5.16 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and to obtain the Tax
opinions set forth in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d). Parent, Merger Sub and
Company agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the
Merger as a "reorganization", with Parent, Merger Sub and Company as "parties
to the reorganization", within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 

 

(b) Officers of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall execute and deliver
to Locke, Lord, Bissell and Liddell LLP, counsel to the Company, and Porter and
Hedges, LLP, counsel to Parent and Merger Sub, certificates containing
appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to such counsels, at such time or times as may be reasonably
requested by such counsels, including the effective date of the Registration
Statement, the date of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Closing Date,
in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions, pursuant to
Section 6.3(d) and Section 6.2(d), with respect to the Tax treatment of the
Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Company shall provide Parent with a certification in accordance with
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) that it is not
a United States real property holding corporation.

 

 

(d) Each of Parent and Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or
fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be
untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
officers' certificates described in this Section 5.16.

 

 

Section 5.17  Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders'
Meeting; No Other Vote. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to it, or by any determination by the Company Board to
modify, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the Merger.
Other than in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.4, the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company
Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so.

 

 

Section 5.18  Additional Instruments and Agreements. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agree to execute and deliver any and all
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement by
written consent of stockholder in lieu of meeting in its capacity as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub promptly (but not later than 24 hours) after
execution of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

 

 

Section 5.19 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parent's operations or give Parent, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the Company's operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and Parent
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

 

 

Section 5.20  Agreements Regarding Change of Control. The Parties hereby
agree and acknowledge that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a
"change of control" of the Company with respect to (i) the Company Benefit
Plans, (ii) the Company Incentive Plans, (iii) any awards or award agreements
under the Company Incentive Plans, and (iv) all the employment agreements set
forth in Section 5.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company hereby agree and acknowledge that the amounts and benefits
set forth opposite the names of the employees identified in Section 5.20 of
the Company Disclosure Letter are the amounts due to such employees (assuming
their employment with Parent or Parent Subsidiaries (including the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) terminates at the Effective Time) pursuant to
their respective employment agreements, retention agreements or severance
agreements with the Company and that such amounts and benefits will be paid
or provided to the designated employees in accordance with the terms of such
agreements; provided, however, that the employees mentioned in Section 5.20
of the Company Disclosure Letter as having continuing non-competition
and/or non-solicitation obligations shall not be released from such
obligations contained in their existing agreements with any Acquired Company.

applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, of any Takeover Laws.

settlement of any stockholder Proceeding against the Company or any of its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no settlement or compromise
shall be agreed to by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 

Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to participate, subject to a
customary joint defense agreement, in, but not control, the defense or
settlement of any stockholder Proceeding against Parent or any of its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no settlement or compromise

on the date of, and as a condition to, the consummation of such Company
Acquisition Proposal described in clause (iii)(A) or (iii)(B)(2) (less any

for purposes of only this Section 7.3(a), the term "Company Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning given to such term in Section 1.1, except
that the references therein to "15%" shall be deemed to be references
to "more than 50%."

Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f), pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by

$6.0 million in the aggregate.

 

 

(e) The Parent will, immediately upon termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e), pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Company an amount equal to the Company's out-of-pocket and documented
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation all such expenses relating to accounting, legal
and investment banking fees; provided, however, that such amount shall not
exceed $6.0 million in the aggregate.

 

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Company Termination Fee" means an
amount in cash equal to $27,300,000.00. The Company Termination Fee shall be
paid (when due and owing) by the Company to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Parent.

 

 

(g) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee (or
any portion thereof) when due, the Company shall reimburse the other party
for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such
other party (including reasonable expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this Section 7.3, together with interest
on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the rate specified in the
Prime Rate in The Wall Street Journal (Northeast Edition) in effect on the

Fee on more than one occasion. The Company's payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to the
occurrences giving rise to such payment, subject to the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub to seek specific performance under Section 8.12 or as a result of
the Company's willful and intentional breach of this Agreement.

format (pdf) transmission, it being understood that all Parties need not sign

Section 8.5  Severability. The provisions of this Agreement will be
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof so long
as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby
are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Subject to
the preceding sentence, any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such term or
provision valid and enforceable, provided that if such term or provision is
incapable of being so modified, then such term or provision shall be deemed
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

 

Section 8.6  Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents

is solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and assigns and does not confer on any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 8.8  Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties, and any such attempted assignment without such consent
shall be immediately null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive
performance of any of the covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of
the conditions, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed by an authorized representative of such Party. Except as
provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereof shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of
the same or any other provisions hereof.

all information received by Parent and the Company pursuant to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and

agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its provisions in
any action or proceeding instituted in any state or federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at Law or in
equity. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations
and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any

arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the

will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees that it will
not bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware.
