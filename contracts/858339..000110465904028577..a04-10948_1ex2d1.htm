(other than an

  



  

4      
   



  

### Affiliate of any Seller, in which case the applicable Seller covenants
and agrees to cause such Affiliate to render such consent) and such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained
prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Non-Assignable Asset_ "), in either
case, the Closing shall proceed, but the Closing shall not constitute the
sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such Non-Assignable
Asset, and this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery of any such Non-Assignable Asset unless and
until such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained. After the
Closing, the applicable Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
related to the Non-Assignable Assets relating to the Property being sold by
such Seller, and Buyer and the applicable Seller shall cooperate with each
other in any arrangement commercially reasonable to provide that Buyer shall
receive the interest of the applicable Seller in the benefits under any such
Non-Assignable Asset until such time as such third party consent, approval or
waiver shall have been obtained, and each of the Buyer and the applicable
Seller shall cooperate with the other party in any such commercially
reasonable arrangement, including performance by the applicable Seller as
agent if commercially reasonable to the applicable Seller, and, in such case,
Buyer shall be liable to the applicable Seller in a fashion equivalent to
what Buyers Liabilities would be under any such Non-Assignable Asset as if
it were assigned. Each applicable Seller shall promptly pay over to Buyer the
net amount (after out-of-pocket expenses) of all payments received by it in
respect of all of its Non-Assignable Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Section 1.4 shall not apply to any authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers that are conditions to consummating the transactions under this
Agreement pursuant to Article IX hereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) Once authorization, approval or waiver of or consent for the sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer of any such Non-Assignable Asset is
obtained, the applicable Seller shall convey, assign, transfer and deliver
any such Non-Assignable Asset at no additional cost to Buyer, and such Non-
Assignable Asset shall thereafter constitute a Purchased Asset.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer
shall assume all Liabilities in respect of any Non-Assignable Asset if it is
receiving the benefits thereof; _provided, further_ , that Buyer shall also
be liable to the Sellers for performing its obligations under the
arrangements described in Section 1.4(a) hereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer understands and agrees that it is solely Buyers responsibility
to obtain any and all operating agreements (other than the Lease Documents)
necessary to conduct business at the Properties from and after the Closing
Date, including, without limitation, replacement software license agreements
for the software which will replace the Excluded Software.  Subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining new
licenses and permits for the operation of the Properties. Except as set forth
in Section 1.1(h) hereof, no licenses or permits will be transferred by any
Seller in connection with the sale of the Properties.

  

### 

  

Section 1.5 _Removal of Excluded Assets_. All items located at each Sellers
Property that constitute such Sellers Excluded Assets may be removed on or
prior to the Closing Date and within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date
by the applicable Seller, its Affiliates, the owners of the Excluded Assets,
or their respective Representatives, with the removing party making any
repairs necessitated by such removal, but without any obligation on the part
of any Seller, any of their respective Affiliates, or any removing party to
replace any item so removed. Each Seller hereby reserves unto itself and its
Affiliates and the owners of the Excluded Assets,

  



  

5      
   



  

and their respective Representatives, a right of entry into its Property and,
with respect to the Harrahs Sellers and Caesars Seller Two, onto and across
their respective Vessels, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice
after the Closing Date and within such thirty (30) day period to effect such
removal, and, in that regard, Sellers shall use reasonable efforts
to minimize disruption to Buyers operations.  Each Seller recognizes that
Buyer will be replacing the Excluded Software at its Property and that Buyer
desires that its replacement software will be operational as of the Transfer
Time.  Subject to Section 1.4(c) hereof, each Seller, with respect to
its Property, agrees to cooperate reasonably with Buyer in effecting the
transition from Excluded Software to replacement software, including
providing Buyer with electronic copies of the Property Specific Data;
_provided that_ : (i) there shall be no material interference with any
Sellers operation of its Property before the Closing Date; (ii) there shall
be no out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by any Seller or any of their
Affiliates in connection with such cooperation; and (iii) no Seller shall be
required to reveal proprietary information to Buyer, other than information
that is included in the Total Assets. Each Seller will uninstall third party
Excluded Software at its Property that is now installed on personal computers
at its Property; _provided_ , _however_ , if Buyer is able to obtain new
licenses for any such software, each Seller will leave copies of such
software at its Property to the extent provided for in such licenses. Buyers
agreement pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall survive the Closing and shall be
covered by Buyers indemnification obligations in _Article XI_ hereof and
enforceable by each Seller by any means available at Law or equity, including
injunctive relief, which Buyer hereby agrees is an appropriate remedy. If any
Seller does not remove any of such Sellers Excluded Assets within fifteen
(15) days following the Closing Date, upon ten (10) calendar days notice to
the applicable Seller, Buyer may dispose of or retain for its own use
(excluding (i) any items included in item (iv) of the definition of "Excluded
Personal Property," and (ii) any third-party software which must be disposed
of) any such remaining Excluded Assets and such Seller shall reimburse, in
each case, Buyer for any reasonable costs incurred with such disposal.

Buyer effective as of the date such employee presents himself or herself to
Buyer for active employment following the Closing Date. Each Property
Employee who so commences employment with Buyer shall hereinafter be referred

its Transferred Employees shall be at-will employees, other than those

Disclosure Letter.

  



  

38      
   



  

### (b) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall assume the employment
agreements set forth in Section 8.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the
extent in effect as of the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable collective
bargaining agreement which is currently in effect or which may be in effect
at any time in the future, (x) for a period of at least one (1) year
immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide each Transferred
Employee with base compensation which is not less than the base compensation
of such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (y) for a
period of at least one (1) year immediately following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide the Transferred Employees with bonus opportunity and annual and
long-term incentive compensation (other than equity-based compensation or any
Seller Benefit Plan containing similar benefits to those plans set forth on
Section 8.4(c) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter) that are in the aggregate, on
an employee by employee basis, no less favorable than those which the
Transferred Employees were provided by the applicable Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that the
Transferred Employees that are parties to the employment agreements which are
assumed pursuant to Section 8.4(b) hereof shall not be entitled to any rights
under this Section 8.4(c).

  

### 

  

### (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable collective

at any time in the future, for a period of at least one (1) year immediately
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, pursuant to plans and arrangements
established or maintained by Buyer (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "), provide
the Transferred Employees with pension, health and welfare benefits which in
the aggregate are substantially comparable to those which the Transferred
Employees were provided under the Seller Benefit Plans (with the exception of
equity-based Seller Benefit Plans , those plans set forth on Section 8.4(c)
of the Buyer Disclosure Letter and any other Seller Benefit Plans that
contains similar benefits to those set forth on Section 8.4(c) of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter) immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall ensure that
the Buyer Benefit Plans treat employment with any of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates prior to the Closing the same as employment with any of
Buyer and its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual under the Buyer Benefit Plans
(except (x) to the extent giving such credit would result in duplication of
benefits, (y) with respect to the benefits accruals under any defined benefit
plan (whether or not tax qualified) and (z) any Buyer Benefit Plan which
provides severance benefits).

  

### 

  

### (e) Effective immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Transferred Employees to be covered by one or more medical benefit plans ("
_Buyer s Medical Plans_") which shall provide benefits to the Transferred
Employees and their dependents which in the aggregate are substantially
comparable to the benefits which were provided to the Transferred Employees
and their dependents by the applicable Sellers medical plans. Buyers
Medical Plans shall not contain any "pre-existing conditions" exclusions or
limitations or "actively at work" requirements which would cause any of the
Transferred Employees or their dependents to be excluded from Buyers Medical
Plans immediately after the Closing. Buyer shall give effect, in determining
any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such employees for the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs under any welfare benefit plans maintained
or contributed to by the applicable Seller for their benefit immediately

agreement which is currently in effect or which may be in effect at any time
in the future, each Transferred Employee who participates in the Harrahs
Entertainment, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan, the Grand Casinos 401(k)
Savings Plan or the Restated Park Place Entertainment Corporation 401(k)
Savings Plan, as applicable (the applicable plan for each Seller, the "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") who satisfies the eligibility requirements of Buyers
401(k) Plan shall become eligible to participate in Buyers 401(k) Plan on
the date he or she becomes an employee of Buyer and shall be credited with
eligibility service and vesting service for all periods of service with the
applicable Seller or any other entity if so credited with such service under
the Seller 401(k) Plan.  As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, each
Seller shall cause the trustees of the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan to
transfer to the trustees or other funding agent of the Buyers 401(k) Plan,
the amounts representing the account balances of the Transferred Employees
(including the appropriate net investment return thereon and any participant
loans made to any Transferred Employees), said amounts to be established as
account balances or accrued benefits of the Transferred Employees under
Buyers 401(k) Plan. Each such transfer shall comply with Section 414(l) of
the Code and the requirements of ERISA and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. The assets to be transferred pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)
shall be in cash, or to the extent mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer
or as required by Law, in kind;  _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
participant loans of a Transferred Employee shall be transferred in kind. At
the time and to the extent that assets held in the trust with respect to the
Seller 401(k) Plan are paid to the trust under the Buyer 401(k) Plan pursuant
to this Section 8.4(f), the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall assume all liabilities of
the Seller 401(k) Plan, for the payment of benefits transferred to the trust
under the Buyer 401(k) Plan, and such transfer shall be in full discharge of
all obligations of the Seller 401(k) Plan in respect thereof; _provided,
however,_ neither Buyer nor the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall assume any liability
for failing to properly value the accounts of Transferred Employees under the
Seller 401(k) Plan or for any other matter relating to the administration or
the investment of the assets of the Seller 401(k) Plan.

  

### 

  

### (g) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be substituted for each Seller,
as applicable, as the contributing employer under each Multiemployer Pension
Plan to which such Seller contributes with respect to the business conducted
by such Seller at its Property (each, a " _Substituted Multiemployer Pension
Plan_ "). It is the intent of the parties to satisfy the provisions of
Section 4204 of ERISA with respect to any obligation that a Seller may have
under each Substituted Multiemployer Pension Plan. Therefore, each Seller and
Buyer agree as follows: (i) from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
continue making contributions to each Substituted Multiemployer Pension Plan
with respect to each Sellers Property Employees in accordance with the terms
of any applicable collective bargaining agreement obligating a Seller to make
contributions to such Substituted Multiemployer Pension Plan for
substantially the same number of contribution base units for which such
Seller has an obligation to contribute to such Substituted Multiemployer
Pension Plan; (ii) unless exempt under Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
Regulations Section 4204.11 or Section 4204.21, Buyer shall post a bond or
hold in escrow in favor of the respective Substituted Multiemployer Pension
Plan for a period of five (5) plan years commencing with the first plan year
beginning after the Closing Date in an amount and form that satisfies the
requirements of Section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA; (iii) in the event that Buyer

  



  

40      
   



  

### withdraws in a complete or partial withdrawal under Section 4201 of ERISA
from the respective Substituted Multiemployer Pension Plan during the first
five (5) plan years beginning after the Closing Date, and Buyer fails to make
any withdrawal liability payments when due, such Seller shall be secondarily
liable for any withdrawal liability that such Seller would have had to the
respective Substituted Multiemployer Pension Plan but for the provisions of
this Section 8.4(g) and Section 4204 of ERISA; and (iv) in the event that all
or substantially all of such Sellers assets are distributed, or if such
Seller is liquidated during the first five (5) plan years beginning after the
Closing Date, then such Seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal
to the present value of the withdrawal liability that such Seller would have
had but for the provisions of this Section 8.4(g) and Section 4204 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (h) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Transferred Employee, any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may
be provided to any Transferred Employee by Buyer or under any benefit plan
which Buyer may maintain.

  

### 

  

### (i) Sellers and Buyer shall adopt the "standard procedure" for preparing
and filing IRS Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as described in Revenue
Procedure 2004-53.  Under this procedure, Seller as the predecessor employer
performs all the reporting duties for the wages and other compensation it
pays, including the filing of quarterly Forms 941 and the furnishing and
filing of Forms W-2 and W-3 to all Transferred Employees.  Seller will file
its quarterly Form 941 for the quarter that includes the Closing Date. Buyer
as the successor employer performs all the reporting duties for the wages and
other compensation it pays. Each Seller and Buyer shall provide all required
IRS Forms W-2 to its respective employees reflecting all wages and taxes paid

shall adopt the standard procedure of Rev. Proc. 2004-53 for purposes of
filing IRS Forms W-4 (Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5
(Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate).  Under this procedure,
Seller as the predecessor employer must keep on file the Forms W-4 and W-5
with respect to each Transferred Employee. The Transferred Employees will
provide Buyer with new Forms W-4 and W-5 as Buyer will be responsible for
deducting and withholding tax from wages paid to the Transferred Employees.
With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support orders, and wage
assignments in effect for a Seller on the Closing Date for Transferred
Employees (other than with respect to contributions to any Seller Benefit
Plan), Buyer shall honor such payroll deduction authorizations with respect
to Transferred Employees and will continue to make payroll deductions and
payments to the authorized payee, as specified by the court or governmental
order that was filed with the applicable Seller on or before the Closing
Date, and Seller will continue to make such payroll deductions and payments
to authorized payees with respect to all other Property Employees who are not
Transferred Employees. Each Seller shall, on or prior to the Closing Date,
provide Buyer with such information in the possession of such Seller as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer and necessary for Buyer to make the payroll
deductions and payments to the authorized payees as required by this Section
8.4(i).

  

### 

  

### (j) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall become a successor employer and shall
assume all Liabilities and obligations under, and be bound by, the collective
bargaining agreements listed on Section 8.4(j) of any Seller Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

41   

      
  

  



  

### (k) On or following the Closing, Buyer shall comply with all provisions
of the WARN Act with respect to all Transferred Employees.  As part of its
obligations under _Article XI_ hereof, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
each Seller harmless from and against any Liability to any Transferred
Employees or any Governmental Entity that may result to any such Seller based
on Buyers failure to comply with any provision of the WARN Act as required
by this Section 8.4(k), including, but not limited to, fines, back pay and
attorneys fees.

### (a) Upon reasonable notice, subject to applicable Law, including without
limitation, antitrust Laws and Gaming Laws, each Seller shall afford
Buyers Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours

including without limitation, its data center facilities for hardware and
software deployment, training, testing and pre-cutover systems engineering to
facilitate a timely systems transition at the Transfer Time, and to all its

such Seller shall furnish promptly to Buyer all (i) copies of monthly
financial reports and development reports, (ii) when available, the unaudited
financial information related to its Property for the nine (9) months ended
September 30, 2004 and all subsequent quarterly periods, (iii) when

months ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 (the " _2003 Audited
Financials_ ") (subject to Buyers payment of any costs or expenses to
produce such financial information) and (iv) all other information concerning
the business and operation of its Property and its Property Employees as
Buyer may reasonably request and Buyer shall have the right to reasonable
office or other space (which if a hotel room or rooms shall be at the expense
of Buyer) at each Property for transition purposes from the date that the
waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated and no
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over federal competition or antitrust
Laws of the United States shall have commenced an investigation, proceeding
or other action which is continuing that could reasonably be expected to
challenge or prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or delay
the Closing thereof beyond the Closing Date and no injunction shall have been
obtained, on the basis of antitrust or competition Laws of the United States
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the " _Inspection_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer shall provide
the applicable Seller with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior written
notice of any Inspection; (ii) if such Seller so requests, Buyers
Representatives shall be accompanied by a Representative of such Seller;

one of such Sellers Representatives, an employers representative or other
agent of such Seller shall be present at all Inspections); (iv) subject to
Section 8.21 hereof, Buyers Representatives shall not be entitled to perform
any physical testing of any nature with respect to any portion of the
Properties without the applicable Sellers prior written consent, which
consent may be withheld if in the reasonable judgment of such Sellers
Representatives such testing would materially interfere with the operation of
the business conducted at its Property; (v) Buyer shall not materially
interfere with the operation of the business conducted at any Property; (vi)
Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly repair

  



  

42      
   



  

### any damage to any Property or any other property owned by a Person other
than Buyer arising from or caused by Inspection, and shall reimburse the
applicable Seller for any loss arising from or caused by any Inspection, and
restore such Property or such other third-party property to substantially the
same condition as existed prior to such Inspection, and shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless such Seller and its Affiliates from and against any
personal injury or property damage claims, liabilities, judgments or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any of them arising or
resulting therefrom; and (vii) without limiting the provisions of Section
8.21 hereof, in no event shall the results of any such Inspection or Buyers
satisfaction therewith be a condition to Buyers obligations hereunder, it
being the intent of Buyer to purchase the Properties on an "As Is, Where
Is" basis as set forth in Section 12.4 hereof.  Buyer will hold and cause
its Representatives to hold any such information furnished to it by Sellers,
which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with (a) the confidentiality
agreement dated August 6, 2004 and amended on August 25, 2004 between
Harrahs and Buyer and (b) the confidentiality agreement dated August 9, 2004
between Caesars and Buyer (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer and each Seller agree
that following the Closing Date the limitations on confidentiality herein and
in the Confidentiality Agreements shall not apply to any information that is
a part of the Total Assets. The Confidentiality Agreements shall survive the
Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, Buyer and each Seller agree that in the event any
proprietary information or knowledge relating to an Excluded Asset of such
Seller is obtained, revealed or otherwise made known to Buyer in effecting
(i) the transition from Excluded Software to replacement software pursuant to
Section 1.5 hereof, specifically, or (ii) the removal of the Excluded Assets,
generally, Buyer shall not reveal, disclose, employ or otherwise use any such
proprietary information and will hold such information in confidence in

cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Representatives, to)
provide the applicable Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives with
reasonable access and duplicating rights, during normal business hours and on
reasonable notice, to all of Buyers personnel, properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records related solely to the Purchased Assets and shall
cooperate with the applicable Seller, as reasonably necessary for such Seller
to pursue any suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to
the claims in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation related to the Excluded Assets; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) the applicable Seller shall provide Buyer with at least
twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice; (ii) if Buyer so requests, the
applicable Sellers Representatives shall be accompanied by a Representative
of Buyer; (iii) the applicable Seller shall not materially interfere with the

Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions governed
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required (A) to be obtained or made by the

reasonably acceptable to Buyer. All matters contained in the new Phase I ESA
reports shall be deemed disclosed to Buyer on Section 6.11 of the applicable
Seller Disclosure Letter as if included therein on the date hereof.

  

### 

  

(b) If the applicable new Phase I ESA identifies reasons to believe that any
Property is contaminated with Hazardous Substances, and if the new Phase I
ESA recommends a Phase II ESA to further investigate any such potential
contamination, then the applicable Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver such Phase II ESA as soon as reasonably practicable, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such delivery within
ninety (90) days from delivery to such Seller of the corresponding Phase I

obtain a written estimate from the Phase II ESA consultant (or such other
consultant as Sellers may reasonably select, subject to Buyers consent that

sentence of Section 8.21(d) hereof, elect to either (1) reduce such Sellers
pro rata portion of the Purchase Price (as set forth in Section 3.1(a)) by
the amount of such estimate, or (2) to use commercially reasonable efforts to
Remediate such Hazardous Substances, if any, prior to the Closing Date, at
such Sellers sole cost and expense.  If such Seller elects to provide such
reduction to Buyer rather than perform any Remediation, then upon the Closing
(and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement) Seller shall have
no further responsibility, obligation or liability to Buyer with respect to
such matters. If such Seller elects to perform the Remediation, then upon
completion of such Remediation (and notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement), Seller shall have no further responsibility, obligation or
liability to Buyer with respect to such matters.

  

### 

  

### (d) Seller may not elect to perform the Remediation unless such
Remediation may be performed without unreasonably interfering with the
operations of the business conducted at the relevant Property. To the
extent that any Seller elects to perform a Remediation and cannot reasonably
complete such Remediation prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall cooperate
with and provide the applicable Seller with reasonable access to the relevant
Property, personnel, documents and materials reasonably required for such
Seller (and shall otherwise cooperate reasonably with such Seller) to
complete such Remediation and Seller agrees that it shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the
operation of the business conducted at the relevant Property.

  



  

54      
   



  

### (e) Each Seller shall promptly provide copies to Buyer of all notices,
correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans and final reports for
the Phase I ESA and the Phase II ESAs (and shall instruct the environmental
consultant to provide such drafts) and shall give Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to comment in advance on such documents and on any submissions
such Seller intends to deliver or submit to Buyer or to the appropriate
Governmental Entity prior to said submission. Buyer may, at its own expense,
hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals to monitor the
Phase I ESA or Phase II ESA investigations and Remediation, including
field work undertaken, and each Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyers monitoring and Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with the results

Section 11.3 _Procedure for Claims between Parties_. If a claim for Damages
is to be made by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
entitled to indemnification hereunder, such party shall give written notice
briefly describing the claim and the total monetary damages sought (each, a "
_Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") and to all the other
parties hereto as soon as practicable after such Indemnified Party becomes
aware of any fact, condition or event which may give rise to Damages for
which indemnification may be sought under this _Article XI_. Any failure to
submit any such notice of claim to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
any Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any lawsuit or enforcement
action is filed against an Indemnified Party by any third party (each, a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification under this _Article XI_ may
be sought, Notice thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party and to all
the other parties hereto as promptly as practicable.  The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give timely Notice hereunder shall not affect rights to
indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
was actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled, if it so elects at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take
control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim, (ii) to
employ and engage attorneys of its own choice (provided that such attorneys
are reasonably acceptable to the

  



  

63      
   



  

Indemnified Party) to handle and defend the same, unless the named parties to
such action or proceeding include both one or more Indemnifying Parties and
an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
an applicable Indemnifying Party, in which event such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties reasonable cost, risk and
expense, to separate counsel (provided that such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and (iii) to compromise or settle such
claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only (x) with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or (y) if such compromise or settlement contains an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
the Indemnifying Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom _;
provided, however,_ that the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such lawsuit or action
and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall cooperate with each
other in any notifications to insurers. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume the defense of such claim within fifteen (15) calendar days after
receipt of the Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such claim has
been asserted will have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Parties
reasonable cost, risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Parties _; provided, however,_ that such claim shall not be
compromised or settled without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party will keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement.

Section 12.1 _Title Commitments and UCC Search_. Buyer has received and
reviewed Schedule B to each title commitment delivered by the Title Insurer
prior to the date hereof to the extent marked and attached to Section 12.1 of
each Seller Disclosure Letter (as related to each Seller such Schedule B
shall mean, its " _Title Commitment_ ") and each UCC-11 Search delivered by
the Title Insurer prior to the date hereof to the extent set forth in Section
12.1 of each Seller Disclosure Letter (as related to each Seller, its " _UCC
Search_ ") as evidence of the status of each Sellers title to its Property
as of the dates thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Title
Commitments (as marked) do not contain or reflect any Major Title Defects.
Each Seller shall cause the Title Insurer to deliver the Title Policy to
Buyer at the Closing insuring that Buyer has leasehold or fee simple title to
the Properties (with such coinsurance and reinsurance reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer), and Buyer agrees to accept title to the Properties subject only to
the Permitted Encumbrances. Buyer shall pay the premium for each Title
Policy and all endorsements thereto. Seller shall execute any and all owners
affidavits as reasonably required by the Title Insurer as necessary to issue
the Title Policy.

### (a) Each Seller may provide Buyer with an updated Title Commitment and
UCC Search from time to time prior to Closing at such Sellers election, and
each Seller shall provide Buyer and its counsel with an updated Title
Commitment and UCC Search not earlier than forty (40) business days and not
later than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing, all at Buyers cost
and expense. To the extent not delivered as of the date hereof, each Seller
shall provide Buyer with a new title commitment and/or UCC-11 searches for
all Properties within thirty (30) days after the date hereof at Sellers sole
cost and expense.

  



  

67      
   



  

### (b) Each Seller shall provide Buyer and its counsel with a new or an
updated and certified Survey, as applicable, within ninety (90) calendar days
after the date hereof at Buyers sole cost and expense.

defects not shown by the applicable Title Commitment, UCC Search, or Survey
provided as of the date hereof that are Major Survey Defects or Major Title
Defects, and Buyer has delivered to the applicable Seller and its counsel an
itemized written notice of such Major Survey Defects or Major Title Defects
(" _Buyer s Title Notice_") within ten (10) business days after the date of
delivery of the applicable new or updated Title Commitment, UCC Search or
Surveys to Buyer, then such Seller shall, within thirty (30) calendar days
after receipt of Buyers Title Notice (the " _Cure Period_ "), begin the
process to cure the Major Survey Defects or Major Title Defects identified in
Buyers Title Notice and to continue to diligently prosecute such cure. If
necessary, the Cure Period and the Closing Date may be extended for a

Major Survey Defects or Major Title Defects identified in Buyers Title

12.3(c) if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.3
have been satisfied. In addition, Seller shall have the obligation to cure
any Monetary Encumbrances on or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, under no circumstances shall any
Permitted Encumbrance be considered a Major Survey Defect or Major Title
Defect for purposes of this Article XII.

  

### 

  

### (d) Failure to provide Seller with Buyers Title Notice within the ten
(10) business day period following delivery of the applicable updated Title
Commitment, UCC Search or Survey shall be deemed a waiver of Buyers right to
disapprove of any matters disclosed by any such updated Title Commitment, UCC
Search or Survey, and Buyer shall then be deemed to have accepted all matters
as described in each Title Commitment, UCC Search and Surveys, as updated,
without reserving any claim against such Seller for title defects or Survey
defects, and all such matters shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances.

  

###

following (at Sellers election): (a) in the case of Major Survey Defects,

Title Defect, delivery of an updated Title Commitment (or endorsement
thereto) showing the deletion from Schedule B of, or endorsement (in a form

Defect or Major Title Defect.

or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer is not relying upon

or express) of any officer, employee, agent or Representative of any Seller,

or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices

Section 13.4 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section
or Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All
Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference.  The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.  Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrase "made available" in
this Agreement shall mean that the information referred to has been made
available if requested by the party to whom such information is to be made
available.  Buyer and Seller will be referred to herein individually as a
"party" and collectively as "parties" (except where the context otherwise
requires).

  



  

Section 13.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 13.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and all documents
and instruments referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, including,
without limitation, that certain letter agreement dated August 27, 2004,
between Harrahs, Caesars and Buyer; _provided_ that the Confidentiality
Agreements shall remain in full force and effect after the Closing. Each
party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, the certificates and other agreements delivered
in accordance with this Agreement and the respective Disclosure Letters, none
of the Sellers nor Buyer makes any other representations or warranties, and
each hereby disclaims any other representations and warranties made by itself
or any of its respective Representatives or

other representatives, with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding
the delivery or disclosure to any of them or their respective representatives
of any documentation or other information with respect to any one or more of
the foregoing.

  



  

Section 13.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

the prior written consent of all of the parties hereto, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder

Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all of its rights,

this Agreement (i) to the banks or other lenders (or any agent therefor)
providing the debt financing to be incurred by Buyer in connection with the
Closing for security purposes, or (ii) to either (A) any controlled Affiliate
of Colony (so long as such Affiliate remains at all times thereafter an
Affiliate of Colony) or (B) any controlled Affiliate of Thomas Barrack (so
long as such Affiliate remains at all times thereafter an Affiliate of Thomas

under this Agreement unless (a) such Affiliate assumes all of Buyers
agreements and obligations hereunder, (b) no such assignment shall relieve
Buyer from any of its agreements and obligations hereunder, and (c) no such
assignment in any way (x) shall adversely effect the ability to receive, or
delay the receipt of, the Gaming Approvals or antitrust approvals
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) shall adversely affect or delay the
Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any assignment
in violation of this Section 13.8 shall be void.
