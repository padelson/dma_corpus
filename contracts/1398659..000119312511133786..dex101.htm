as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(v) pursuant to  _Section 2.8(c)_, to each Person holding In-The-Money
Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to (A)
the _product of_ (x) the Per Share Common Payment, _multiplied by_ (y)
the aggregate number of Company Common Shares issuable in respect of all In-
The-Money Options outstanding and held by such Person as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (assuming all such In-The-Money Options were exercised
in full), _minus_  (B) the aggregate Exercise Price that would be paid to the
Company in respect of such In-The-Money Options had such In-The-Money Options
been exercised in full (and assuming concurrent payment in full of the
Exercise Price 

 



14  of each such In-The-Money Option solely in cash) and _minus_ (C) any
applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(vi) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary

payable by Parent at the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.9(a)_ in respect
of the PPA Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Representative
Expense Fund Account and all Company Common Shares and Company Options exceed
the Estimated Purchase Price and (ii) following the Actual Adjustment, in no
event shall the aggregate consideration paid or payable by Parent pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of the PPA Escrow Account, the Indemnity Escrow
Account, the Representative Expense Fund Account and all Company Common Shares
and Company Options (or other capital stock of the Company) exceed the
Purchase Price.

 

(b) _Determination of the Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Representative (A) a proposed
calculation of the Net Working Capital, (B) a proposed calculation of the
amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (C) a proposed calculation of the amount
of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, (D) a proposed calculation of the amount

in the case of each of (A) through (E), the components thereof. The proposed
calculations described in the previous sentence shall collectively be
referred to herein from time to time as the " _Proposed Closing Date
Calculations_ ". The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be accompanied
by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of Parent certifying that
the information set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations was
calculated in good faith in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, if Parent fails to timely deliver
any of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, then, at the election of the
Representative, either: (x) the Actual Adjustment shall be deemed to equal
zero; or (y) the Representative shall retain a nationally or regionally
recognized independent accounting firm to review the calculation of the
amount of Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness and Company Expenses used for the Estimated Purchase Price
Calculations and make any adjustments necessary thereto to make such amounts
consistent with the provisions of this _Section 2.9(b)_ ( _provided_ that
such accounting firm may only make adjustments based on noncompliance with the
standards set forth in this Agreement for the determination of the Purchase
Price), the determination of such accounting firm being conclusive and binding
on the Parties. In the event of such failure to timely deliver the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations, the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, make its financial records reasonably available to
such accounting firm in connection with its services and all fees and expenses
of such accounting firm shall be paid by Parent.

 

(ii) If the Representative does not give written notice of dispute (a "
_Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within 30 days of receiving the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations
shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, 

 



15  Company Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes
hereunder (including, without limitation, the determination of the Actual
Adjustment); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in the event that Parent does
not provide any materials reasonably requested by Representative within five
days of request therefor (or such shorter period as may remain in such 30-day
period) in accordance with  _Section 2.9(b)(iv)_, such 30-day period shall
be extended by one day for each additional day required for Parent to fully
respond to such request, and (B) the Purchase Price Dispute Notice may include
only objections based on (x) noncompliance with the standards set forth in
this _Section 2.9(b)_ for the preparation of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations or (y) mathematical errors in the calculation of the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations. The Purchase Price Dispute Notice shall be
accompanied by a certificate signed by the Representative certifying that the
information set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice was calculated in
good faith in accordance with this Agreement. If the Representative gives a
Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent (which Purchase Price Dispute Notice
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and amounts in dispute and all
other items and amounts not so disputed shall be deemed final) within such
30-day period, Parent and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date
Parent receives the applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from the
Representative and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. If the
Representative and Parent do not agree upon a final resolution with respect
to such disputed items within such 30-day period, then the remaining items in
dispute shall be submitted immediately to an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Representative. If Parent and the
Representative are unable to agree on the choice of an accounting firm within
ten Business Days after the expiration of the aforementioned 30-day period,
then Parent and the Representative shall select a nationally-
recognized independent accounting firm by lot (after excluding their
respective regularly used accounting firms). Any accounting firm so agreed to
or selected (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be required to render a
determination of the applicable dispute within 45 days after referral of the
matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor; _provided_ that the
Accounting Firm may (i) only consider those items and amounts as to which the
Representative and Parent have disagreed within the time periods and on the
terms specified above and (ii) only make adjustments based on noncompliance
with the standards set forth in this Agreement for the determination of the
Purchase Price. The determination made by the Accounting Firm with respect to
the remaining disputed items shall not exceed or be less than the amounts
proposed by the Representative and Parent, as the case may be. The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon
between the Representative and Parent, and any associated engagement fees
shall initially be borne 50% by the Representative and 50% by Parent; 
_provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with
_Section 2.9(b)(iii)_. The fees of such Accounting Firm allocable to the
Representative shall not be the personal obligations of the Representative and
shall be paid by the Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders)
from the Representative Expense Fund. The determination of such Accounting
Firm shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Agreement.
Parent shall revise the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as appropriate to
reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this _Section
2.9(b)(ii)_, and, as revised, such

 



16  Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final
Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, Company Expenses and Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder (including, without limitation, the determination of the
Actual Adjustment).

(iii) In the event the Representative and Parent submit any unresolved
objections to the Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section
2.9(b)(ii)_, the responsibility for the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be as follows:

(A) if the Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of Parents position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred to herein
as the " _Low Value_ "), then all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be paid by the Representative from the Representative Expense Fund
and the Representative shall deliver written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to make such payment;

(B) if the Accounting Firm resolves all of the remaining objections in favor
of the Representatives position (the Purchase Price so determined is referred
to herein as the " _High Value_ "), then Parent shall be responsible for all
of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm; and

 

(C) if the Accounting Firm neither resolves all of the remaining objections in
favor of Parents position nor resolves all of the remaining objections in
favor of the Representatives position (the Purchase Price so determined is

and expenses of the Accounting Firm equal to (x) the difference between the

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Parent shall pay to the

immediately available funds, in each case, within three Business Days after
the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)_.

 



17 (ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within

Percentage Interest.

Section 2.10 _Option Plans_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take the
appropriate actions pursuant to the Option Plan (and the underlying option
grant agreements) that are necessary to give effect to the provisions of
_Section 2.8(c)_ and _Section 2.9(a)(v)_ with respect to the Company
Options. The Option Plan shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and no
holder of Company Options or any participant in the Option Plan shall have any
rights thereunder, including, without limitation, any rights to acquire any
equity securities of any Group Company, the Surviving Entity or any
Subsidiaries thereof or any other Person, other than, in the case of the In-
The-Money Options, to receive a portion of the Purchase Price as provided
herein.

 

Section 2.11 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,

in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Entity or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, and the Representative, on behalf of
the Company Stockholders, shall assist in any such actions (including by
executing and delivering, in the name and on behalf of the Company
Stockholders or in its capacity as the Representative, all such deeds, bills
of sale, assignments and assurances).

 

Section 2.12 _Payment of Funded Indebtedness and Company Expenses_. At least
two Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent

Section 2.13  _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person under this Agreement such
amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be, so withholds any such amounts, such amounts shall be (A) timely paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Entity and (B) treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties agree that no non-United States Taxes are required to be deducted or
withheld from the payments made pursuant to  _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_.

ARTICLE 3

EXCHANGE OF COMPANY CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Payment_. At the Closing, each Company Stockholder may deliver
to the Exchange Agent for cancellation the stock certificates representing
such Company Stockholders Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (collectively, such Company Stockholders " _Company
Certificates_ ") together with an executed and completed copy of the letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (but in any
event, within five Business Days), the Exchange Agent shall pay the
consideration to be paid to such Company Stockholder pursuant to _Section
2.9(a)(iv)_, without interest thereon. From time to time after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Entity to make
available, to the Exchange Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary
for the payment of the consideration payable to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_, it being understood that any interest
earned on funds made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be turned over to Parent.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange Procedures_. To the extent that a Company Stockholder
has not delivered the Company Certificates representing all of such Company
Stockholders shares of Company Common Shares as of the Closing, together with
an executed and completed copy of the Letter of Transmittal, then, promptly
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to the applicable
Company Stockholders: (a) the Letter of Transmittal and (b) instructions for
effecting the surrender of each Company Certificate in exchange for the amount
to be paid to 

 



19  such Company Stockholder pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_. Upon surrender
of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, the Company
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be marked as canceled, and the
holder of such Company Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and as soon as reasonably practicable after the surrender thereof
(but in any event, within ten Business Days), the Exchange Agent shall pay the
consideration payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_,
without interest thereon. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Company Certificate. If payment of such
consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Company Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Company Certificate and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable.

 

Section 3.3 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates_. If any Company
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (a) the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, (b) the execution and delivery to the Surviving
Entity by such Person of an indemnity agreement in customary form and
substance and (c) the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Surviving Entity may reasonably direct, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the
amount of cash, without interest, that such Person would have been entitled
to receive had such Person surrendered such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificate to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 

Section 3.4 No _Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article 3_ , neither the Company, Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving
Entity shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Company Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on
which any consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity, any such consideration shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Company Common Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders of such
Company Common Shares who have properly exercised and demanded appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with the DGCL in connection with the
Merger (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the consideration payable therefor pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_,
if any, and holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment
of the appraised value of Company Common Shares in accordance with
the provisions of the DGCL, unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have

 



20  become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration payable therefor pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_, if any,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent notice of any
written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any
other related instruments received by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to (a)
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and
(b) with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any such
demands or related claims arising out of the exercise of appraisal rights or
dissenters rights with respect to the Merger by any holder of Dissenting
Shares solely for a cash payment made by the Company prior to the Effective
Time.

Section 3.6 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares; Closing of
Company Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, each holder of
Company Common Shares shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury
shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ or Dissenting Shares),
the right to surrender his or her Company Certificates in exchange for payment
of the consideration payable therefor pursuant to  _Section 2.9(a)(iv)_, if
any, or, in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her
right to receive payment for his or her Company Common Shares pursuant to the
DGCL. All consideration paid upon the surrender of a Company Certificate in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Shares formerly represented by such Company Certificate. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer
of Company Common Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall
be exchanged as provided for in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
even if a holder of Company Common Shares (other than a holder of Dissenting
Shares) is not entitled to receive any portion of the Purchase Price with
respect to such holders Company Common Shares, such shares shall
nevertheless be cancelled as of the Effective Time and such holder shall cease
to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company from and after the
Effective Time (subject in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares to
perfection of his or her right to receive payment for his or her Company
Common Shares pursuant to the DGCL).

its respective jurisdiction of formation or organization (as applicable). Each
Group Company has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate

(b) Each Group Company is duly qualified or licensed to transact business and
is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction in which
the property owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in

per annum); and _provided further_ , that the Surviving Entity may substitute
therefor policies containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous in the aggregate to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such

matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.

entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be third party

agreement with the Company the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such Person or its
representatives and terminate access by each such Person and
its representatives to any online or other data rooms containing any
information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may respond to any unsolicited
proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating that the Company
is subject to a definitive agreement regarding a transaction and is unable to
provide any information related to the Group Companies or entertain any
proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning
an Acquisition Transaction for as long as such definitive agreement remains in
effect. The Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) advise

rights under the Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements with respect
to the availability of the Financing at or prior to Closing; and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event any portion
of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain promptly any such portion from
alternative sources, including, on terms and conditions (including economic
terms, termination rights, flex provisions and funding conditions)
substantially similar to those included in the Commitment Letter as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, in an amount sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Financing that is available, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Alternative Financing_ ")
and to obtain, and, when obtained, to promptly provide the Company with a copy
of, a new financing commitment that provides for financing in an amount that
is sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the
Financing is available to be drawn down by Parent, in an aggregate amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been
satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing), Parent shall draw on such Financing and shall consummate the
Closing. Parent shall give the Company notice promptly upon becoming aware of
any material breach or threatened (in writing) material breach by any party
to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, and Parent shall
promptly give the Company notice in writing upon becoming aware of any
termination or threatened (in writing) termination of the Commitment Letter, 

 



47   _provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not be considered
for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing conditions set
forth in _Article 7_ or give rise to a right of termination under _Article
8_. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend,
modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace the Commitment Letter in a
manner that expands on the conditions precedent or contingencies to
the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in such
agreements or that could otherwise impair, delay or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Within (i) 45 days after the end of each fiscal month of the Company, the
Company shall deliver to Parent unaudited statements of operations and cash
flows for the Company for such fiscal month and the unaudited balance sheet of
the Company as of the last day of such fiscal month and (ii) 60 days after the
end of each fiscal quarter of the Company, the Company shall deliver to
Parent unaudited statements of operations and cash flows for the Company for
such fiscal quarter and the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the
last day of such fiscal quarter (the financial statements contemplated by (i)
and (ii), the " _Additional Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_ ");
_provided_ that Parent shall have no further obligation under this _Section
6.15_ from and after the Closing Date. The Additional Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements (including notes and schedules thereto) (i) shall have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods covered thereby, except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and except for the absence of footnotes and subject to year-end adjustments
and (ii) shall fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Group Companies as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and
comprehensive income (loss) and changes in cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject to the absence of footnotes and to normal year-end
adjustments).

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, for all purposes of
_Section 7.2(b)_, unless (i) the Company shall have committed any
intentional breach of _Section 6.15(a)_ and (ii) such breach alone, or
together with all other such breaches, was the primary cause of Parents
failure to obtain the Financing, the Company shall not be deemed to be in
breach of any of its obligations under, and it shall be deemed to have
complied with all of its obligations contained in, _Section 6.15(a)_.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirm their obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, irrespective and independently of the availability of Financing,
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Article
7_.

Section 6.16 _Guarantee_.

 

(a) Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Company the due and punctual payment and performance of, and compliance by
Parent and Merger Sub with, all obligations, covenants, warranties and
undertakings agreed by Parent or

 



48  Merger Sub to be performed, observed or complied with by Parent or Merger
Sub and contained in or arising under this Agreement, including the full and
punctual payment by Parent, when due, of the Purchase Price as provided in
_Section 2.9_ (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ").

(b) The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be satisfied
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The liabilities and
obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this _Section 6.16_ are
independent of any liabilities or obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under or
in respect of this Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought
and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce its obligations under this
_Section 6.16_, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Parent
or Merger Sub or whether Parent or Merger Sub is joined in any such action or
actions.

 

(c) The Guarantors obligations under this _Section 6.16_ shall not be
released or discharged by any or all of the following: (i) any change in the
time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of
the Guaranteed Obligations or any other liabilities or obligations of Parent
or Merger Sub under or in respect of this Agreement, or any other amendment
or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement; (ii) any express
amendment or modification of or supplement to this Agreement, or any
assignment or transfer of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any
failure on the part of Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply with this
Agreement; (iv) any waiver, consent, change, extension, indulgence or other
action or any action or inaction under or in respect of this Agreement; (v)
any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment,
composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to Guarantor,
Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective properties, or any action taken by
any trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles; (vi) any change in the name or
ownership of Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person referred to herein; or
(vii) any termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Guarantor represents that, directly or indirectly through one or more
wholly owned Subsidiaries, it owns 100% of the outstanding equity interests
of Parent.

(e) The Guarantor hereby waives (i) notice of acceptance of this guarantee,
(ii) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of the Guarantor and
(iii) any right to require that any action be brought against Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person, or to require that the Company seek enforcement of
any performance against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person prior to any
action against the Guarantor under the terms hereof.

(f) Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of the Company in
the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights under this _Section 6.16_
shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a
release of the Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

(g) The Guarantor agrees that this guarantee shall continue to be effective
or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if all or any part of any payment
made thereunder is at any time avoided or rescinded or must otherwise be
restored or repaid as a result of the bankruptcy of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantor, or otherwise avoided or recovered directly

 



49  or indirectly from the Company as a preference, fraudulent transfer or
otherwise, irrespective of any notice of revocation given by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantor prior to such avoidance or recovery.

(h) The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 

(i) The Guarantor is an exempted limited company, duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its
businesses as now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power
or authority would not materially impact its ability to perform
its obligations hereunder.

(ii) The Guarantor has all necessary power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
that are applicable to the Guarantor. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that
are applicable to the Guarantor have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the Guarantor and no other proceeding (including,
without limitation, by its equityholders) on the part of the Guarantor is
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby that are applicable to the Guarantor. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and constitutes
a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Guarantor, enforceable against
the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except (i) to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (ii) that the availability of equitable
remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance, is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be
brought.

 

(iii) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Guarantor nor the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions
contemplated hereby that are applicable to the Guarantor will (a) conflict
with or result in any breach of any provision of the Guarantors Governing
Documents, (b) except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ result in a violation or
breach of, or cause acceleration, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract to which the Guarantor is a party or by which it or
any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (c) violate any Law or writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity applicable to the Guarantor
or any of its properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c)
above, for violations which would not materially impact the Guarantors
ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 6.17 _Section 280G Payments_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall, with respect to such payments and/or benefits that are reasonably
likely to, separately or in the aggregate, without regard to the measures
described herein, constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the applicable rulings and final
regulations thereunder (" _Section 280G Payments_ "), use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a vote satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code, including exerting its 

 



50  reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers, such that no portion of the
Section 280G Payments will constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. The Company shall forward to Parent, and
allow Parent to review and comment upon, prior to submission to the Companys
stockholders copies of all material documents prepared by the Company in
connection with this  _Section 6.17_.

Section 7.4  _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No Party may rely on the

ARTICLE 8

 

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



53 (b) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_, _Section 7.2(b)_ or 
_Section 7.2(c)_; _provided_ that, prior to any termination of this Agreement
under this _Section 8.1(b)_, the Company shall be entitled to cure any such
breach (if capable of being cured) during a 30-day period following receipt
of written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ if such breach by the Company is cured during such 30-day
period so that such conditions would then be satisfied);

(c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_
or  _Section 7.3(b)_; _provided_ that, prior to any termination of this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)_, Parent or Merger Sub shall be entitled

(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is
the result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its respective obligations
or covenants under this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that if the Closing
has not occurred by the Termination Date due solely to the failure of the
condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ to be satisfied because any Other
Antitrust Approval has not been obtained as of the Termination Date, then the
Termination Date shall automatically extended to a date determined in good
faith by Parent and the Representative (which extension shall in no event be
less than 30 days);

 

(e) by the Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the
Termination Date, unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result
of a breach by the Company of its obligations or covenants under this
Agreement; _provided_ , however, that if the Closing has not occurred by the
Termination Date due solely to the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_ to be satisfied because any Other Antitrust Approval has not
been obtained as of the Termination Date, then the Termination Date shall
automatically extended to a date determined in good faith by Parent and the
Representative (which extension shall in no event be less than 30 days);

(f) from and after 48 hours following the execution of this Agreement, by
Parent if the Required Company Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained;
or

(g) by either Parent or by the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have

enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order,
decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(g)_ shall have used reasonable best efforts to remove such
order, decree, ruling, judgment or injunction.

 



54 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this entire Agreement shall forthwith
become void (and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers, directors
or equityholders) with the exception of (a) _Section 4.17_ , the provisions
of this _Section 8.2_, the last sentence of _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.6_
and _Article 11_ , and (b) any liability of any Party for any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.

Section 8.3 _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Law, including the DGCL, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. After the Effective Time, subject
to applicable Law, including the DGCL, this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Representative. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except as provided in the
immediately preceding two sentences and there shall be made no amendment that
by Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders without the
further approval of such Company Stockholders, and any amendment by any Party
or Parties effected in a manner which does not comply with this _Section 8.3_
shall be void.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company contained
herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company, the Representative
or any Company Stockholder with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. Any waiver of
any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition, of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS;

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the Company and of Parent and Merger Sub
contained in _Article 4_ or _Article 5_ , as the case may be, or in any

the case may be, shall, regardless of any investigation, information or
knowledge with respect thereto survive the Closing until the earlier of (a) 30
days after the date of Parents receipt of audited financial statements of
the Company for the year ended December

 



55  31, 2011 or (b) the date that is one year after the Closing Date (in either
case, the " _Survival Period Termination Date_ "). Claims for breaches of
covenants that contemplate performance prior to Closing may be made at any
time prior to the Survival Period Termination Date. Any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate in accordance
with the preceding sentences will continue to survive if a written notice
shall have been timely given on or prior to such termination date until the
related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided in this _Article 9_ , but only with respect to matters reasonably
described in such notice. All covenants or agreements that contemplate
performance following the Closing shall survive in accordance with the
respective term as provided in this Agreement or, if none, until the

indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall survive until the date
that is two years after the Closing Date.

officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and/or agents (each a " _Purchaser
Indemnitee_ ") harmless from any damages, losses, liabilities, obligations,
actions, proceedings, claims of any kind, interest, costs or expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, and
other costs or expenses incurred in the collection of any judgments with
respect to actions, proceedings or claims) (each a " _Loss_ ") suffered or
paid, directly or indirectly, as a result of, in connection with, or arising
out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
(A) contained in _Article 4_ or (B) in any certificate delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, (ii) any
breach by the Company of any of the covenants or agreements contained herein
which are to be performed by the Company on or before the Closing Date, and
(iii) the exercise of appraisal rights by the holders of the
Dissenting Shares (it being understood that such Losses shall be the
difference between the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares and the Per
Share Common Payment applicable to such shares _plus_ any other reasonable
costs or expenses incurred in connection therewith).

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 9_ , each of Parent and
the Surviving Entity agree to indemnify, defend (subject to _Section 9.3_)
and hold the Company Equityholders and their respective Affiliates, officers,

harmless from any Loss suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as a result
of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub (A) contained in _Article 5_ or (B)
in any certificate delivered to the Company or the Representative pursuant to
_Section 7.3(c)_, (ii) any breach by Parent of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein and (iii) any breach by the Surviving
Entity (including, without limitation, by way of being the successor of
Merger Sub and the Company) of any of its covenants or agreements contained
herein which are to be performed by the Surviving Entity after the Closing
Date (except to the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ and except if the applicable Company
Indemnitees are not third party beneficiaries of such covenant or agreement
contained herein).

 



56 (c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this  _Section
9.2_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
for the applicable period set forth in _Section 9.1_, except for claims for
indemnification asserted prior to the end of such applicable period (which
claims shall survive until final resolution thereof).

(d) The rights of the Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of _Section 9.2(a)_, and the rights of Company Indemnitees to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.2(b)_, shall not be
affected by (i) in the case of Purchaser Indemnitees, any Purchaser
Indemnitees knowledge at or prior to the execution of this Agreement or at or
prior to the Closing of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) in the case of Company
Indemnitees, any Company Indemnitees knowledge at or prior to the execution
of this Agreement or at or prior to the Closing of any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger
Sub in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Claims_.

(a) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Person, including any
Governmental Entity, who is not a Party or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") is made against any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this
_Article 9_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated
to indemnify such Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Purchaser
Indemnitee seeking indemnification, such Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly
notify the Representative, in each case, such notified Party, the "
_Responsible Party_ ")) of such claims; _provided_  that the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Responsible Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall identify specifically
the basis under which indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section 9.2_
and enclose true and correct copies of any written document furnished to the
Indemnified Party by the Person that instituted the Third Party Claim. The
Responsible Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to assume
the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party at the expense of the Responsible Party, of the defense
thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Responsible Party
in connection therewith; _provided_ that such assumption and control shall
occur only if (i) the Third Party Claim involves solely a claim for monetary
damages ( _provided_ that if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction
or other equitable relief or relief for other than monetary damages against
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, can be readily separated from any
related claim for monetary damages, the Responsible Party shall be entitled to
assume the control of the defense of the portion relating to monetary
damages), (ii) the Responsible Party acknowledges in writing its irrevocable
and unconditional obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder
(subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 9_ ), (iii) the defense
of such Third Party Claim by the Responsible Party would not reasonably be
expected to adversely effect the Indemnified Partys relationship with any of
the Material Customers and (iv) in the case of a Purchaser Indemnitee seeking
indemnification, taking into account all other pending claims for
indemnification, the provisions of _Section 9.4(d)_ relating to the Escrow
Account would not reasonably be expected to prevent any Purchaser Indemnitee

 



57  from being fully indemnified (subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article 9_ ) with the then remaining funds in the Escrow Account with respect
to such Third Party Claim in the event of an adverse determination. If the
Responsible Party shall assume the conduct and control of any such Third Party
Claim, the Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate
in such defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Responsible Party if (A) the Indemnified Party shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that an actual
or potential conflict of interest makes representation by the same counsel or
the counsel selected by the Responsible Party inappropriate or (B) the
Responsible Party shall have authorized the Indemnified Party to employ
separate counsel at the Responsible Partys expense). So long as the
Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim if it waives any right to indemnity therefor
unless the Responsible Party shall have consented to such payment or
settlement. If the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within 30 days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim
of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to
this Agreement. The Responsible Party shall not, except with the consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or discharge, or admit any
liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim unless the relief
consists solely of money Losses to be paid by the Responsible Party and
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person(s)
asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release
from all liability with respect to such claim.

(b) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder, and each Party (or a duly authorized representative of such
Party) shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the
Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.2(a)_, and of the Company Indemnities pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_, as applicable, are subject to the following limitations:

 

(a) The amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of any amounts
actually recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses
incurred in procuring such recovery) by the Purchaser Indemnitees or Company
Indemnitees, as applicable, under insurance policies or other collateral
sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained
outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Losses ( _provided_ , that the
amount deemed to be so recovered under insurance policies shall be net of (A)
the deductible for such policies and (B) any increase in the premium for such
policies arising out of or in connection with such Losses).

(b) The Purchaser Indemnitees or the Company Indemnitees, as applicable,
shall not be entitled to recover Losses for any particular claim or series of
claims arising out of

 



58  the same facts pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, as
applicable, other than with respect to breaches of the Fundamental
Representations and Warranties, unless such Losses equal or exceed $100,000.

(c) The Purchaser Indemnitees or the Company Indemnitees, as applicable,
shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ or
_Section 9.2(b)_(i), as applicable, other than with respect to breaches of
the Fundamental Representations and Warranties, until the total amount which
the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Company Indemnitees, as applicable, would
recover under _Section 9.2(a)_(i) or _Section 9.2(b)_(i), as applicable,
exceeds $4,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case, the Purchaser
Indemnitees or the Company Indemnitees, as applicable, shall only be entitled
to recover Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount.

(d) The funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, at any given time, shall be the
sole source of recovery with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_, and in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be
entitled to recover more than the amount of the funds available in the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Article 9_ shall in any way limit or restrict the
availability of the PPA Escrow Account to fund obligations under _Section
2.9_.

(e) In no event shall any Company Equityholders liability for Losses exceed
the net proceeds actually received by such Company Equityholder hereunder.

(f) In no event shall the liability of Parent and Merger Sub for Losses
pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 

(g) No Purchaser Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee, as applicable, shall be
entitled to indemnification for any claim if and to the extent (but only to
the extent) the Losses with respect to such claim were accounted for in the
Actual Adjustment.

(h) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach for
indemnification purposes and the amount of any Losses that are the subject
matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement and each certificate delivered pursuant hereto (in
each case other than the Qualified Representations) shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to the term(s) "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" contained therein.

(i) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith;  _provided_
, that such failure to mitigate Losses in accordance with the foregoing shall
not relieve the applicable Responsible Party of its indemnification
obligations under this _Article 9_ except to the extent that any Losses
were directly the result of such failure to mitigate.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the
Closing, on the date that the Indemnity Escrow Funds are reduced to zero, the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no further rights to indemnification under
_Section 9.2(a)_. Where a 

 



59  Purchaser Indemnitee recovers, under insurance policies or from other
collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter for which such Purchaser
Indemnitee was indemnified pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)_, such Purchaser
Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to the Representative the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred
by such Purchaser Indemnitee in procuring such recovery), but not in excess
of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such
Purchaser Indemnitee in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by
the Representative in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter; _provided_ that, prior to the Survival Period Termination Date, any
such recovered amount shall be deposited into the Escrow Account to fund the
indemnification obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_ (rather than be paid
over to the Representative).

Section 9.5 _The Representative_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to perform certain
administrative functions in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Representative shall have no liability to, and shall not be
liable for any Losses of, any Party or to any Purchaser Indemnitee in
connection with any obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such Losses shall be
proven to be the direct result of gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement.

Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, but subject to _Section 11.15_, from and after the Closing,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 9_ shall be the
exclusive remedy for the Parties for any misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty, covenant or other agreement or provision contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, except in the event
of fraud and except for any claims under _Section 2.9(a)_, _Section 2.9(b)_
and  _Section 2.9(c)_.

Section 9.7 _Manner of Payment; Escrow_.

 

(a) Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Company
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article 9_ shall be effected by wire transfer
of immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an account
designated in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees or Company
Indemnitees, as the case may be, within 15 days after the final
determination thereof; _provided_ that any indemnification owed by the
Company Equityholders to the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ shall be satisfied from the funds then remaining in the Escrow
Account.

 

(b) Any funds remaining in the Escrow Account as of the Survival Period
Termination Date (minus the aggregate amount claimed by the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to claims made against such funds and not fully resolved
prior to such date) shall be released to the Representative for distribution
to each applicable Company Equityholder according to each respective Company
Equityholders Percentage Interest. At any time following the Survival Period
Termination Date, to the extent the funds held in the Escrow Account exceed
the aggregate amount claimed by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims
made prior to such Survival Period Termination Date and not fully resolved
prior to the time of determination, the

 



60  excess funds shall be promptly released to the Representative for
distribution to each applicable Company Equityholder according to each
respective Company Equityholders Percentage Interest.

(c) The Representative and the Surviving Entity shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make any
distributions from the Escrow Account expressly provided for herein.

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Entity shall
have no obligations, responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever to the Company
Equityholders with respect to the distribution to the Company Equityholders
by the Representative of funds received by the Representative from the PPA
Escrow Account, Indemnity Escrow Account or Representative Expense Fund
Account.

 

Section 9.8 _Distribution of Representative Expense Fund_. In addition to any
post-Closing payments made pursuant to  _Section 2.9_ and _Section 9.7_,
and any payments that are not required to be paid pursuant to the Sale Bonus
Plan (with such amounts (the " _Unpaid Amounts_ ") to be paid by the
Representative to the Company Equityholders based on their respective
Percentage Interests, _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
maximum amount payable with respect to the Change of Control Payments shall
have been included in the Company Expenses as of the Closing and (ii), other
than payment of the Company Expenses or the distribution of the funds provided
by the Headstrong Employee Share Trust to certain Company employees through
the Companys payroll system (as permitted under the terms of the Headstrong
Employee Share Trust) in connection with the payment of the Company Expenses
at Closing in accordance with _Section 2.12_, none of Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall have any liability or
obligation whatsoever pursuant to the Sale Bonus Plan, the Headstrong Employee
Share Trust or for the Unpaid Amounts), promptly following the later of the
Survival Period Termination Date and the resolution of all outstanding
indemnification claims made by Parent in accordance with this _Article 9_ ,
(a) the Representative shall prepare and deliver to the Escrow Agent written
instructions with respect to any amount remaining in the Representative
Expense Fund following the payment of any amounts pursuant to _Section
10.1(d)_ hereof to the Representative in connection with costs and expenses
incurred by the Representative resulting from the performance of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the taking of
any and all actions in connection therewith (such remaining portion, the "
_Expense Fund Excess Amount_ ") and (b) the Escrow Agent shall promptly (and
in any event within two Business Days) following receipt of such written
instructions pay from the Representative Expense Fund, in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, to each applicable Company Equityholder the applicable
portion of the Expense Fund Excess Amount set forth in the written
instructions in accordance therewith and determined according to each
respective Company Equityholders Percentage Interest.

Section 9.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. 

 



61 ARTICLE 10

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY EQUITYHOLDERS

Section 10.1  _Authorization of Representative_.

(a) By virtue of adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders and
without further action by any Company Stockholder, the Representative is
hereby irrevocably appointed, authorized and empowered to act as a
representative for the benefit of the Company Equityholders, as the exclusive
agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Company Equityholder, in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, which shall include the power and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or
changes therein as to which the Representative, in its sole discretion, shall
have consented) and to agree to such amendments or modifications thereto as
the Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable;

 

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as the Representative, in its sole discretion,
may deem necessary or desirable;

(iii) to collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds and property
payable to the Representative from the Indemnity Escrow Account and the PPA
Escrow Account as described herein or otherwise payable to the Representative
pursuant to this Agreement (including the Expense Fund Excess Amount), and,
subject to any applicable withholding retention Laws, and net of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Representative (including,
without limitation, any Company Expenses paid by the Representative), the
Representative shall disburse and pay the same, no later than three Business
Days from the date of receipt of such moneys, proceeds and/or property by the
Representative, to each of the Company Equityholders to the extent of each
respective Company Equityholders Percentage Interest;

 

(iv) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the Company Equityholders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests
of the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein or the transactions
provided for herein or therein (including, without limitation, in connection
with any and all claims for indemnification brought under _Article 9_ ), and
to take any and all actions which the Representative believes are necessary
or appropriate under the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement for and on
behalf of the Company Equityholders, including, without limitation, asserting
or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ")
against Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Entity, defending any Third
Party Claims or Claims by the Purchaser Indemnitees, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with
Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective representatives regarding
such Claims, and,

 



62  in connection therewith, to (A) assert any claim or institute any action,
proceeding or investigation, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any
claim, action, proceeding or investigation initiated by Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any other Person, or by any federal, state or local Governmental
Entity against the Representative and/or any of the Company Equityholders or
the Escrow Funds, and receive process on behalf of any or all Company
Equityholders in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and
compromise or settle on such terms as the Representative shall determine to be
appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to
any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation, (C) file any proofs of
debt, claims and petitions as the Representative may deem advisable or
necessary, (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted under the Escrow
Agreement and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or
award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it being
understood that the Representative shall not have any obligation to take any
such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any
such actions;

(v) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Company Equityholder and/or
the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document
in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ that no such failure to act on
the part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or in the Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or
interest by the Representative or by such Company Equityholder unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving Party or by the Representative;
and

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in
its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or
convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other agreements, documents
or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection
herewith and therewith.

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its third party and reasonable internal
expenses incurred as the Representative pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_. In
connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any instrument,
agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing
to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any Company Equityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct or breach of the Escrow Agreement by the Representative and (ii)
the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public
accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue,
and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the Representative
pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the Representative to
liability to any Company Equityholder,

 



63  except where such reliance is a result of the Representatives willful
misconduct. Each Company Equityholder shall indemnify, pro rata based upon
such Company Equityholders Percentage Interest, the Representative against
all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys, accountants and other
experts fees and the amount of any judgment against them, of any nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, any and all expenses whatsoever
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claims whatsoever), arising out
of or in connection with any claim, investigation, challenge, action or
proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or
omissions of the Representative hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or
otherwise in its capacity as the Representative. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or proceeding which
finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative hereunder for its
willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon
written notice from the Representative to the Company Equityholder as to the
existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification
amount, each Company Equityholder shall promptly deliver to
the Representative full payment of his or her ratable share of the amount of
such deficiency, in accordance with such Company Equityholders Percentage
Interest.

 

(c) At any time from the Closing Date until payment of any remaining amounts
in the Representative Expense Fund in accordance with _Section 9.7(b)_, upon
written notice to the Escrow Agent from the Representative of documented costs
and expenses (including all fees and disbursements of counsel, financial
advisors and accountants) incurred by the Representative in connection with
the performance of its rights or obligations under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and the taking of any and all actions in connection
therewith, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Representative the amount of
such costs and expenses from the Representative Expense Fund. In connection
with the performance of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and the taking of any and all actions in connection
therewith, the Representative shall not be required to expend any of the
amounts held in the Representative Expense Fund (though, for the avoidance of
doubt, it may do so at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion)
and in no event shall the Representative be required to incur any costs or
expenses or expend any amount in excess of amounts held in the Representative
Expense Fund.

(d) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement. 

(e) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be
legally binding upon the Company Equityholders.

 

(f) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Equityholder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger.

agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or

under this Agreement, and each Party hereby agrees to waive the defense in
any such suit that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law and to

or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this _Section 11.15_ shall be in addition to,

are collectively referred to as the " _Escrow Amounts_ ".

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises and
undertakings set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in the Merger
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable
with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between
the parties, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the
Merger Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any
Person has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such
agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
those of the Merger Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to this
Agreement, or any other agreement among the parties hereto, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall control. 2\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. Purchaser and the Representative hereby
appoint the Escrow Agent as escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein
and in the Merger Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
appointment, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein.

 

3\. _Deposit of Funds into Escrow Accounts_.

(a) As directed in accordance with Section 2.9 of the Merger Agreement,
Purchaser has deposited with the Escrow Agent for the benefit of Purchaser and
the Representative, as applicable, (i) the PPA Escrow Amount to be held in
the PPA Escrow Account maintained by the Escrow Agent, (ii) the Escrow Amount
to be held in the Escrow Account maintained by the Escrow Agent and (iii) the

Section_ 11.15(b)5.

 

(b) Receipt, investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amounts shall be
confirmed by the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by account statement
sent to the parties hereto, and the Escrow Agent shall be notified by the
parties hereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, of
any discrepancies in any such account statement.

 

4\. _Holding of Escrow Amounts_. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow
Amounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

5\. _Investment of Escrow Amounts_. During the term of this Agreement, each of
the PPA Escrow Amount, Escrow Amount and Representative Expense Fund Amount
shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent in (i) separately
segregated JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. money market deposit accounts (each an "
_MMDA_ "), each of which shall be segregated apart from the general funds of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or (ii) such other investments as shall be jointly
directed in writing by Purchaser and the Representative and as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Escrow Agent (" _Alternative Investments_ ").
MMDAs have rates of return that may vary from time to time based upon market
conditions. Directions regarding Alternative Investments shall be in writing
and shall specify the type of the investments to be purchased and/or sold.
The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales of
investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital markets
operations or those of any affiliated entity. The Escrow Agent or any of its
affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any Alternative

exchange rates and other valuation information (including, without
limitation, market value, current value or notional value) of any Alternative
Investment furnished in any report or statement is furnished for the exclusive
use of Purchaser and the Representative. The Escrow Agent has
no responsibility whatsoever to determine the market or other value of any
Alternative Investment and makes no representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy of any such valuations or that any values
necessarily reflect the proceeds that may be received on the sale of an
Alternative Investment. Periodic statements shall be provided to Purchaser and
the Representative reflecting transactions of the Escrow Accounts. Purchaser
and the Representative, upon written request to the Escrow Agent, shall
receive a statement of  transaction details upon completion of any securities transaction in the
Escrow Accounts without any additional cost. The Escrow Agent shall have the
right to liquidate any investments held in order to provide funds necessary
to make required payments under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no
liability for any loss sustained as a result of: (i) any investment or
Alternative Investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (ii) any
liquidation of any investment prior to its maturity or (iii) the failure of
Purchaser and the Representative to give the Escrow Agent instructions to
invest or reinvest the Escrow Amounts. In the absence of joint written
instructions from Purchaser and the Representative, the Escrow Agent shall
invest the Escrow Amounts in MMDAs.

6.  _Procedures for Disbursement of Escrow Amounts_. Except for disbursements
made pursuant to _Section 8(a)_, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to make
disbursements from the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the
following provisions, but not otherwise:

(a) _Joint Instructions_. If a certificate or written instruction is jointly
executed by Purchaser and the Representative, and delivered to the Escrow
Agent, which certificate or instructions specifically reference this Agreement
and this _Section Section 11.15(_a), and which certificate or
instructions instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute the Escrow Amounts or
such portion thereof in a particular manner to any Person or Persons in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Amounts or such portion shall
be so distributed by the Escrow Agent.

(b) _Method of Payments_. All payments and releases hereunder shall be made as

such bank account or accounts designated in writing to the Escrow Agent (i)
by Purchaser in the case of payments to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnitee
hereunder, (ii) by the Representative in the case of payments to the
Representative hereunder or (iii) in the case of payments to third parties,
as Purchaser and the Representative may mutually agree in writing.

7.  _Escrow Agent s Duties and Fees_.

(a) _Duties Limited_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties
as are expressly set forth herein and no other duties shall be implied. Except
as provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall not be subject to, or have any
liability or responsibility under, nor be obliged to recognize, any
other agreements, directions or instructions of any of the parties hereto or
any other Person in carrying out its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the primary cause of such loss was due to the Escrow Agents
gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct.

 

(b) _Reliance_. The Escrow Agent may rely upon, and shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon, any written notices, instructions or
requests furnished to it pursuant to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties in a timely fashion without
inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow
Agent shall also be protected in refraining from acting upon any such notices,
instructions or requests furnished to it  and believed by it not to be genuine or timely furnished. The Escrow
Agreement shall not be liable to Purchaser, the Representative, any
beneficiary or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction
setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to or related to the transfer
or distribution of the Escrow Amounts, or any portion thereof, unless such
instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with 
_Section 12_ below and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any
applicable security procedures as may be required thereunder. The Escrow Agent
may execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly
or through agents or attorneys, and shall be liable only for its gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct (as finally adjudicated in a court of
competent jurisdiction) in the selection of any such agent or attorney. The
Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons
to be selected and retained by it. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be
uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions,
claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its reasonable opinion,
conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely
all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing
by all of the other parties hereto or by a final non-appealable order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable
for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage
of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if
the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to
solicit any payments which may be due to it or due in respect of the Escrow
Accounts, including, without limitation, the Escrow Amounts, nor shall the
Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or
correctness of any amounts deposited hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have no
duty or obligation to make any calculations of any kind hereunder.

 

(c) _Indemnification_. Purchaser and the Representative jointly and severally
hereby agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors,
employees, successors, assigns, managers, attorneys, accountants, experts and
agents (the " _Agent Indemnitees_ ") for, and hold such indemnities harmless
against, any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties,
judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation,
investigations, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, the
reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one outside counsel and all
expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively "
_Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with (i) the Escrow Agents
execution and performance of this Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the
enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the
Agent Indemnitees, except in the case of any Agent Indemnitee to the extent
that such Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction
to have been primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct of such Agent Indemnitee, or (ii) its following any instructions or
other directions, whether joint or singular, from Purchaser or the
Representative, except to the extent that its following any such instruction
or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The parties hereby
grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security
interest in the Escrow Amounts for the payment of any claim for
indemnification, compensation, expenses and amounts due to the Escrow Agent
hereunder. The obligations contained in this _Section Section_ 11.15(b)7
_(c)_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation,
replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent. (d) _Successor Escrow Agents_. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged
from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving notice in writing of such
resignation to Purchaser and the Representative not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date thereof, specifying the date upon which
such resignation shall take effect. In addition, Purchaser and the
Representative acting jointly, shall have the right to terminate the
appointment of the Escrow Agent by giving it thirty (30) days notice in
writing of such termination, specifying the date upon which such termination
shall take effect. In the event of the resignation or termination of the
Escrow Agent, the parties hereto shall appoint a successor before the
effective date thereof and shall give written notice to the Escrow Agent then
serving of such appointment. Upon demand of the successor escrow agent, and
payment of the Escrow Agents fees and expenses pursuant to _Section Section
11.15(_e), all funds and property in the Escrow Accounts shall be turned over
promptly to such successor escrow agent, who shall thereupon be bound by all
of the provisions hereof. If the parties hereto shall fail to name a successor
escrow agent prior to the effective date of the Escrow Agents resignation or
termination hereunder, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other
appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon
all of the parties hereto. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such
thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Amounts
(without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a
designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the
directions of a final non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, at which time the Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall
cease and terminate. 

(e) _Fees_. (i) Purchaser agrees to (1) simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement and from time to time thereafter, pay the Escrow Agent for
services rendered hereunder with respect to the PPA Escrow Account, Escrow
Account and Representative Expense Account in accordance with the schedule set
forth on _Schedule 1_ attached hereto, and (2) reimburse the Escrow Agent for
any out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by it in carrying out its
duties hereunder with respect to the PPA Escrow Account and the Escrow
Account.

 

(ii) The Representative agrees to reimburse the Escrow Agent for any out-of-
pocket expenses reasonably incurred by it in carrying out its duties
hereunder with respect to the Representative Expense Account. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to withdraw the expenses set forth in the preceding sentence
directly from the Representative Expense Account.

 

(f) _Additional Documents_. Purchaser and the Representative agree to execute
and deliver to the Escrow Agent such additional documents as it may
reasonably request to evidence termination of this Agreement and to evidence
their consent to the distribution and/or release of the Escrow Amounts from
the Escrow Accounts.

 

8\. _Taxes_.

(a) Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amounts for all tax
purposes. The income earned in respect of the Escrow Amounts shall be
allocated for tax purposes to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay any taxes
payable in respect of any income earned on the Escrow Amounts; provided,
however, that, in order to enable Purchaser to satisfy  its tax obligations, the Escrow Agent shall disburse from the Escrow
Amounts, at the end of each quarter, an amount equal to 40% of such income
earned during such quarter. The Escrow Agent shall prepare and file all tax
returns, and the Escrow Agent shall file Forms 1099 and/or Form 1042-S, or
other applicable tax forms, consistent with such treatment.

(b) Purchaser and the Representative shall jointly provide the Escrow Agent on
or prior to any disbursement, a detailed schedule indicating the allocation of
the disbursement amount from the Escrow Amounts between (i) principal amount
and (ii) imputed interest. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
schedule and shall report to the IRS and any other taxing authority as
required by law based upon the information so provided (including by filing
IRS Form 1099-INT and/or 1042-S, or any other required form).

(c) Any other tax returns required to be filed in respect of the Escrow
Amounts shall be prepared and filed by Purchaser and the Representative, as
applicable, with the IRS and any other taxing authority as required by law,
including but not limited to any applicable reporting or withholding pursuant
to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (" _FIRPTA_ "). Purchaser
and the Representative acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent shall have
no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of such other income tax
return or any applicable FIRPTA reporting or withholding with respect to the
Escrow Amount or any income earned by the Escrow Amount. Other than as
provided in _Section 8(a)_, in the absence of a joint written direction from
Purchaser and the Representative, all proceeds of the Escrow Amounts shall be
retained in the Escrow Accounts and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow
Agent as provided in this Agreement.

 

9\. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event that any dispute arises with respect to
this Agreement or in the event that any claim with respect to the Escrow
Accounts is disputed, or the Escrow Agent is faced with inconsistent claims or
demands by the parties hereto, then the Escrow Agent is authorized and
directed to retain in its possession without liability to any Person some
or all of the Escrow Amounts (but not in excess of the amount in dispute)
until such dispute shall have been settled either by the mutual agreement of
the parties involved or by court order, judgment, decree, attachment or levy
(a " _Final Resolution_ "). It is hereby understood that any Final Resolution
that is received by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section Section_
11.15(c)9 directing the release of all or any portion of the Escrow Amounts
shall be accompanied by a letter from counsel stating that the Final
Resolution is final and non-appealable along with a letter of the payee(s),
specifying the amounts, time(s) and complete wire transfer information,
confirmed pursuant to _Section Section_ 11.15(c)12. The Escrow Agent may,
but shall be under no duty to, institute or defend any legal proceeding which
relates to this Agreement. The parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse
in connection with any dispute between Purchaser and the Representative
without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. The parties to this
Agreement hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any
lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. 

10\. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service_. The parties to this Agreement
consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
and of any federal court located in the State of New York in connection with
any actions or proceeding arising out of or in relation to this Agreement and
each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue,
forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds to the jurisdiction of such
courts. In any  such action or proceeding the parties hereto hereby absolutely and
irrevocably waive personal service of any summons, complaint, declaration or
other process and agrees that service thereof may be made by certified or
registered first class mail directed to the parties hereto at the addresses
set forth in _Section Section_ 11.15(c)11.

11\. _Notices and Funds Transfer Information_. All communications hereunder
shall be in writing and except for communications from Purchaser and the
Representative setting forth, claiming, objecting to or in any way related to
the transfer of distribution of funds, including but not limited to funds
transfer instructions (all of which shall be specifically governed by _Section
12_ below), shall be deemed to be duly given after it has been received if it
is sent or served:

(a) by facsimile;

 

(b) by overnight courier; or

 

(c) by prepaid registered mail, return receipt requested;

to the appropriate notice address set forth below or at such other address as
any party hereto may have furnished to the other parties in writing.

 

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the
Escrow Agent, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the
date received by an officer of the Escrow Agent or any employee of the Escrow
Agent who reports directly to such officer at the below referenced office. Any

12\. _Security Procedures_.

(a) Notwithstanding any contrary as set forth in _Section 11_, any
instructions setting forth, claiming containing, objecting to or in any way
related to the transfer or distribution of funds, including but not limited to
any such funds transfer instructions that may otherwise be set forth in a
written instruction permitted pursuant to _Section 6_ of this Agreement,
maybe given to the Escrow Agent only by confirmed facsimile and no instruction
for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Amounts, or any
portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered and effective unless the Escrow
Agent actually shall have received such instruction by facsimile at the number
provided to Purchaser and the Representative by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with _Section 11_ and as further evidenced by a confirmed
transmittal to that number. (b) In the event Escrow Accounts funds transfer instructions are received
by the Escrow Agent by facsimile, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the Person or
Persons designated on _Schedule 2_ hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon
the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the Person or Persons so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed
only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. In
the event that the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized
representatives identified in _Schedule 2_ hereto, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
any one or more of Purchasers or the Representatives (as applicable)
executive officers (" _Authorized Officers_ "), which shall include the titles
of, in the case of Purchaser, Treasurer and Vice President and Senior Legal
Counsel and, in the case of the Representative, President, Vice President and
Secretary, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such Authorized Officer shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any
such Authorized Officer. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any
funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Purchaser or the Representative to identify (i) the
beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank or (iii) an intermediary bank. The
Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
Person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank designated.

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that the Escrow Agent is authorized to use the
following funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to Purchaser
under this Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth in _Section
12(b)_ above:

Bank Address: 11170 N Central Expressway, Dallas TX

ABA Number: 026009593

 

Account Name: Genpact International Inc.

 

Account Number: 375-657-0988

_

 

ABA Number:  _  
_ Account Name:  _  
_

Account Number:  _  
_

 

(e) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures
are commercially reasonable. All funds transfer instructions shall be
executed by an authorized signatory as set forth on _Schedule 2_ hereto.

13.  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by and upon
the receipt by the Escrow Agent of a joint written notice of termination
executed by each of Purchaser and the Representative directing the
distribution of all property then held by the Escrow Agent under and pursuant
to this Agreement. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if and when
all of the Escrow Amounts (which includes all the securities in which any of
the Escrow Amounts shall have been invested) shall have been distributed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

14\. _Miscellaneous_. 

(a) _Benefit of Parties_. This Agreement and the various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person (other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any
rights or remedies hereunder. Any corporation or association into which the
Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated,
or to which it may sell or transfer its escrow services business and assets
as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or association
resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to
which it is a party, shall be and become successor escrow agent hereunder and
vested with all the trusts, powers, discretions, immunities, privileges and
all other matters as was its predecessor, without the execution or filing of
any instrument or any further act, deed or conveyance on the part of any of
the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. Except
as otherwise provided herein, no assignment or attempted assignment of this
Agreement or any interest hereunder shall be effective without the written
consent of parties hereto. Any transfer or assignment of any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder in violation of the terms hereof shall be
void and of no force or effect.

(b) _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL
RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW
PRINCIPLES.

(c) _Force Majeure_. No party to this Agreement is liable to any other party
for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the
terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, floods, war, terrorism,
electrical outages, strikes, equipment or transmission failure, or other
causes reasonably beyond its control.

(d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which taken together shall constitute one instrument. All signatures of the
parties to this Agreement may be transmitted by  facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the
original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be
binding upon such party.

 

(e) _Amendments; Waivers_. This Agreement may not be changed, amended,
terminated, augmented, rescinded or discharged (other than by performance),
in whole or in part, except by a writing executed by all of the parties
hereto, and no waiver of any of the provisions or conditions of this Agreement
or any of the rights of a party hereto shall be effective or binding unless
such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the party claimed to have given
or consented thereto. Except to the extent that a party hereto may have
otherwise agreed in writing, no waiver by that party of any condition of this
Agreement or breach by the other party of any of its obligations or
representations hereunder or thereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
other condition or subsequent or prior breach of the same or any other
obligation or representation by the other party, nor shall any forbearance by
the first party to seek a remedy for any noncompliance or breach by the other
party be deemed to be a waiver by the first party of its rights and remedies
with respect to such noncompliance or breach.

 

(f) _Patriot Act Disclosure_. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 (" _USA PATRIOT Act_ ") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any Person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge that
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agents identity
verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which
may be used to confirm the parties identity including without limitation
name, address and organizational documents (" _identifying information_ ").
The parties hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the
Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying information
required as a condition of opening an account with or using any service
provided by the Escrow Agent.

(g) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains all of the terms agreed upon
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

(h) _Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that any property in the
Escrow Accounts shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court
order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a
court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court
order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply
with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of
such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

Extraordinary Services and Out-of Pocket Expenses

 

Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, and
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorneys or accountants
fees and expenses will be considered extraordinary services for which related
costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Banks
then standard rate. Disbursements, receipts, investments or tax reporting
exceeding 25 items per year may be treated as extraordinary services thereby
incurring additional charges. The Escrow Agent may impose, charge, pass-

services provided by the Escrow Agent, including but not limited to,
transaction, maintenance, balance-deficiency, and service fess and other
charges, including those levied by any governmental authority.

Disclosure and Assumptions



    |  |

Please note that the fees quoted are based on a review of the transaction
documents provided and an internal due diligence review. JPMorgan
reserves the right to revise, modify, change and supplement the fees quoted
herein if the assumptions underlying the activity in the account, level of
balances, market volatility or conditions or other factors change from those
used to set our fees.

    |  |

The Parties acknowledge and agree that they are permitted by U.S. law to make
up to six (6) pre-authorized withdrawals or telephonic transfers from an MMDA
per calendar month or statement cycle or similar period. If the MMDA can be
accessed by checks, drafts, bills of exchange, notes and other financial
instruments ("Items"), then no more than three (3) of these six (6) transfers
may be made by an Item. The Escrow Agent is required by U.S. law to reserve
the right to require at least seven (7) days notice prior to a withdrawal from
a money market deposit account.

Telephone call-backs shall be made to each of Purchaser and the Representative
when joint instructions are required pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. Periodically, Purchaser and the Representative may issue payment orders to the
Escrow Agent to transfer funds by federal funds wire. The Escrow Agent
reviews the orders to determine compliance with the governing documentation
and to confirm signature by the appropriate party, in accordance with this
Schedule 2. The Escrow Agents policy requires that, where practicable, it
undertake callbacks to a party other than the individual who signed the
payment order to verify the authenticity of the payment order.

Inasmuch as a person is the only employee in his or her office who can confirm
wire transfers, the Escrow Agent shall call him or her to confirm any federal
funds wire transfer payment order purportedly issued by him or her. Such
persons continued issuance of payment orders to the Escrow Agent and
confirmation in accordance with this procedure shall constitute such persons
agreement (1) to the callback security procedure outlined herein and (2) that
the security procedure outlined herein constitutes a commercially reasonable
method of verifying the authenticity of payment orders. Moreover, Purchaser
and the Representative agree to accept any risk associated with a deviation
from this policy. _Exhibit C - Form of Letter of Transmittal_ EXHIBIT C

Substitute Form W-9. Each person surrendering Company Common Shares that is a
"U.S. person" is required to supply the Exchange Agent with such holders
correct Taxpayer Identification Number (" _TIN_ ") on the Substitute Form W-9
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , and to certify whether such holder is subject
to backup withholding. Failure to provide the TIN information on the form may
subject the holder to backup withholding at a rate of 28% on payments made to
such surrendering holder with respect to such holders Company Common Shares.
If such holder is an individual, the TIN is the individuals social security
number. If the surrendering holder has not been issued a TIN and has applied
for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future, then the
surrendering holder should write "Applied For" in the box in Part I. Such
surrendering holder must also complete the "Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer
Identification Number" below in order to avoid backup withholding. If "Applied
For" is written in the box in Part I, and the surrendering holder does not
provide the Exchange Agent with a properly certified TIN within 60 days, the
Exchange Agent will withhold 28% of the Aggregate Equity Consideration. If the
holder is subject to  

---|---|---  backup withholding, then such holder must cross out item (2) in Part III of
the Substitute Form W-9. Each person surrendering Company Common Shares that
is not a U.S. person generally should provide the Exchange Agent with a
properly completed applicable IRS Form W-8 to avoid backup withholding. See
also "Important Tax Information" in this Letter of Transmittal.

 IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

Under federal income tax law, a person who holds Certificates surrendered for
exchange is required to provide the Exchange Agent with such holders
properly certified TIN on Substitute Form W-9 or otherwise establish a basis
for exemption from backup withholding (including by providing an applicable
IRS Form W-8). If such holder is an individual, the TIN is such holders
social security number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct
TIN, the holder may be subject to a penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS"). In addition, delivery to such holder of the check for
the Aggregate Equity Consideration may be subject to backup withholding at a
rate of 28%.

Certain holders of Certificates (including, among others, all corporations
and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding
and reporting requirements. An exempt holder of Certificates that is a U.S.
person should indicate its exempt status on Substitute Form W-9 by writing
the word "EXEMPT" on the line in Part II. A foreign individual may qualify as
an exempt recipient by submitting to the Exchange Agent a properly completed
applicable IRS Form W-8 (which the Exchange Agent will supply upon request or
is available online at www.irs.gov), signed under penalties of perjury,
attesting to the exemption status of the holder of Certificates. See the
enclosed Substitute Form W-9 for additional instructions.

 

If (i) the holder does not furnish the Exchange Agent with a TIN in the
required manner, (ii) the IRS notifies the Exchange Agent that the TIN
provided is incorrect, or (iii) the holder is required but fails to certify
that it is not subject to backup withholding, backup withholding will apply.
If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent is required to withhold 28%
of any payment made to the holder of the Certificates or other payee. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons
subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld.
If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes and the required
information is timely furnished, a refund may be obtained from the IRS.

 

What Number to Give the Exchange Agent

The holder is required to give the Exchange Agent the TIN (e.g., the social
security number or employer identification number) of the registered holder of
the Certificates. If the Certificates are held in more than one name or are
not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed publication titled
"Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9." _Exhibit D - Form of Surviving Entity Certificate of Incorporation_ FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no
director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Article SIXTH shall eliminate or limit the liability of a
director or officer (i) for any breach of the directors or officers duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or
officer derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal
of this Article SIXTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any director or officer of the Corporation for or with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring prior
to such amendment or repeal.

_SEVENTH_ : The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section
145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may
be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said
Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-

in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely
affect any right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time  of such repeal or modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to
such repeal or modification.

The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses
(including without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any
director or officer within 15 days of the presentation of same to the
Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as
the Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured
undertaking to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that
such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation
to advance costs and expenses shall be mandatory, and not discretionary, and
shall include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in asserting
affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims. Such undertaking to
repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable director or
officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer, provided
that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party
making such undertaking.

_EIGHTH_ : Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the Corporation
shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot. _Exhibit E - Form of Estimated Purchase Price Calculations_ For illustrative purposes only with amounts estimated as of February 28, 2011

Internal Revenue Service by the transferee and that any false statement made
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment or both. Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I am a responsible officer of the
