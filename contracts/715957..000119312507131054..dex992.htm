upon whether any Title Defects have been cured, or Sellers have failed to cure any Title Defects which they provided notice that they would attempt to cure, and Sellers and Purchaser have been unable to agree on the Title Defect Amounts for such
Title Defects, the cure and/or Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5)&nbsp;year
period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title Arbitrator&#146;s determination shall be made within 45 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section&nbsp;3.5(g) and 3.5(h) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful
to make a proper determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect cures and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, and DEPI shall be responsible for the remaining one-half of the
costs and expenses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
