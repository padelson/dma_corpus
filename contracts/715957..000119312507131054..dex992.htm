ARTICLE 2\.

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Interests (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be Two Billion Five Hundred Million dollars
($2,500,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "), adjusted as provided
in Section 2.3.

Section 2.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Shares of each
Company and to the DEPI Additional Assets, the DOTEPI Additional Assets and
the Reserves Additional Assets as set forth in the Interests Schedule (each
an " _Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "). The adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 shall be applied to  



 

14  the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company, the
DEPI Additional Assets, the DOTEPI Additional Assets and the Reserves
Additional Assets based upon the owner of the specific Lease, Well or other
asset to which the adjustment relates, if determinable. Any adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 that are not specific to any
Company or Additional Asset group (for example, general and administrative
expense of the EandP Business under Section 2.3(h)(ii)) shall be applied pro
rata to the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company,
the DEPI Additional Assets, the DOTEPI Additional Assets, and the Reserves
Additional Assets, as previously adjusted, in proportion to the amount of
each. Each Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be
referred to herein as the " _Interest Purchase Price_."

(b) Each Seller shall be entitled to the portion of the Purchase Price equal
to the Interest Purchase Price for the various Interests it is selling.

(c) Within seventeen (17) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall prepare in good faith and deliver to DEPI (i) a draft
schedule of the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Prices (the final agreed or
determined version being referred to herein as the " _Interests Schedule_ ")
and (ii) a draft schedule setting forth a proposed detailed allocation of
each Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets associated with the
Shares for each Company, with the DEPI Additional Assets, with the DOTEPI
Additional Assets and with the Reserves Additional Assets, respectively (the
final agreed or determined version being referred to herein as the "
_Allocated Values Schedule_ "). Each such allocation shall be reasonably
acceptable to Sellers. Purchaser and DEPI on behalf of Sellers shall
attempt to reach agreement in writing upon such allocations within five (5)
Business Days after DEPIs receipt of the schedules. If the Parties are unable
to reach agreement within such five (5) Business Day period, Sellers may use
their allocations (which shall, to the extent there is no dispute, conform to
Purchasers) instead of Purchasers for sending notices to holders of
preferential rights to purchase or similar rights pursuant to Section 3.6(a),
and the disputed allocations shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator
pursuant to Section 3.5(i) for resolution and determination of the final
schedules. For any Well, Unit or PUD Lease with a disputed allocation for
which a preferential right to purchase or similar right is validly exercised,
Purchaser shall be credited pursuant to Section 3.6(e)(iii) with the Allocated
Value for the Well, Unit or PUD Lease based on the allocation determined by
the Title Arbitrator, rather than the allocated value amount included by
Sellers in their notice.

(d) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Target Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best information
available to Sellers, a schedule setting forth the following items:

(i) the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.1
allocated to Interests other than the Additional Assets;

(ii) the liabilities of the Companies and the Subsidiary as of the Closing (as
required for the allocations under clause (iii)); 

(iii) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under clause
(i) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (ii) that are
part of the  



 

15  adjusted grossed-up basis within the meaning of Treasury Regulation §
1.338-5 among the classes of assets of the Companies and any Subsidiary
(other than any Company or Subsidiary that is not a member of a selling
consolidated group within the meaning of Treasury Regulations §
1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(2)) as of the Closing, which allocations shall be made in
accordance with Section 338(b)(5) and (h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and shall be consistent with the allocations in the
Interests Schedules and the Allocated Values Schedule;

(iv) the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.1
allocated to the Additional Assets;

(v) the liabilities associated with the Additional Assets as of the Closing
(as required for the allocations under clause (vi)); and 

(vi) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under clause
(iv) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (v) that are
includable in the Purchasers tax basis in the Additional Assets among the
classes of the Additional Assets as of the Closing, which allocations shall be
made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and shall be consistent with the Interests Schedule and the
Allocated Values Schedule.

Sellers shall at Purchasers request make reasonable documentation available
to support the proposed allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not
later than fifteen (15) days following receipt of Sellers proposed allocation
schedule, Purchaser shall deliver to DEPI a written report containing any
changes that Purchaser proposes to be made in such schedule (and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail). The Parties shall undertake to
agree on a final schedule no later than six (6) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. In the event the Parties cannot reach agreement by that date,
the Sellers allocation shall be used pending adjustment under the following
paragraph.

Within thirty (30) days after the determination of the Purchase Price under
Section 8.4(b), the schedule described above in this Section 2.2(d) shall
be amended by Sellers and delivered to Purchaser to reflect the Purchase
Price following final adjustments. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in
the preparation of the amended schedule as described in Section 9.4. If the
Sellers amendments to the schedule are not objected to by Purchaser (by
written notice to DEPI specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail)
within thirty (30) days after delivery of Sellers adjustments to the
schedule, it shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties. In the event that
the Parties cannot reach an agreement within twenty (20) days after Seller
receives notice of any objection by Purchaser, then, any Party may refer the
matters in dispute to Ernst and Young LLP or another mutually acceptable
independent appraiser (the " _Independent Appraiser_ ") to assist in
determining the fair value of each separate class of Company Assets or
Additional Assets, as the case may be, solely for the purposes of the
allocation described in this Section 2.2(d). Should Ernst and Young LLP fail or
refuse to agree to serve as Independent Appraiser within twenty (20) days
after written request from any Party to serve, and the Parties fail to agree
in writing on a replacement Independent Appraiser within ten (10) days after
the end of that twenty (20) day period, or should no replacement Independent
Appraiser agree to serve within forty-five (45) days after the original
written request pursuant to this sentence, the  



 

16  Independent Appraiser shall be appointed by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association. The Independent Appraiser shall be
instructed to deliver to Purchaser and Sellers a written determination of the
valuation and any revisions to the schedule within thirty (30) days after the
date of referral thereof to the Independent Appraiser. Purchaser and Sellers
agree to accept the Independent Appraisers determinations as to the
appropriate adjustments to the schedule. The Independent Appraiser may
determine the issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement, as it reasonably deems appropriate in the
circumstances and with reference to the amounts in issue. The Parties do not
intend to impose any particular procedures upon the Independent Appraiser, it
being the desire and direction of the Parties that any such disagreement
shall be resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably
practicable. The Independent Appraiser shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of the allocation
schedule submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest, or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser
shall bear its own legal fees and costs of presenting its case. DEPI shall
bear one half and Purchaser shall bear one half of the costs and expenses of
the Independent Appraiser.

The allocations set forth in the schedule described in this Section
2.2(d) shall be used by Sellers, Purchaser, the Companies and the Subsidiary
as the basis for reporting asset values and other items, including the
determination of the deemed sale price and the adjusted grossed-up basis of
the assets of the applicable Companies and the Subsidiary in accordance with
Treasury Regulation § 1.338 5 or similar applicable law, for purposes of all
Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or any successor
form)). The allocations set forth in the schedule described in this Section
2.2(d) shall also be used by Sellers and Purchaser in preparing Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement (which Form 8594 shall
be completed, executed and delivered by such parties as soon as practicable
after the Closing but in no event later than 15 days prior to the date such
form is required to be filed). Sellers and Purchaser agree not to assert, and
will cause their Affiliates not to assert, in connection with any audit
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset values or other items
inconsistent with the amounts set forth in the schedule described in this
Section 2.2(d).

Section 2.3 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Interest Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be adjusted with respect to the Shares of each Company, the DEPI
Additional Assets, the DOTEPI Additional Assets and the Reserves Additional
Assets as follows, but only with respect to matters (i) in the case of Section

transferred to Purchasers control at the Closing;

Section 2.5 _Procedures_.

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, (i) liquid hydrocarbons
shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass
through the pipeline flange connecting into the storage facilities located on
the lands subject to the applicable Lease or Unit or, if there  



 

22  are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or
similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they
are transported from those lands, and (ii) gaseous hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass through
the delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the point of entry into
the pipelines through which they are transported from the lands subject to
the applicable Lease or Unit. Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative
procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
are not available. 

Surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling on or before, or after, the Effective Date, or the Closing
Date, as applicable. Production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of
production, and severance Taxes, shall be prorated based on the amount
of hydrocarbons actually produced, purchased or sold, as applicable, on or
before, and after, the Effective Date, or the Closing Date, as applicable.

(b) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle (and Sellers shall cooperate with
the handling of) all joint interest audits and other audits of Property Costs
with respect to the Assets, including those covering periods on or prior to
the Effective Date, provided that Purchaser shall not agree to any
adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Sellers are liable, or any
compromise of any audit claims to which Sellers would be entitled, without the
prior written consent of DEPI, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
Purchaser shall provide DEPI with a copy of all applicable audit reports and
written audit agreements received by Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned Company or
the Subsidiary and relating in whole or in part to periods on or prior to the
Effective Date.

the Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary associated with each such PUD
Lease (the " _PUD Lease Exhibit Supplement_ "). Such supplement shall be
prepared in consultation with Purchaser, and shall be based on the best
information available to Sellers at the time. From and after the PUD Lease
Exhibit Delivery Date, this Agreement and the PUD Lease Exhibit Supplement
shall be read and construed as one document.

Section 3.2 _Definition of Defensible Title_.

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means that
title of each Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable,
which, subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

(i) Entitles the Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, to receive, throughout the duration of the productive life of any
Unit, Well or PUD Lease (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding
royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production of oil and gas), not less than the "net
revenue interest" share shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 of all oil, gas and
other minerals produced, saved and marketed from such Unit, Well or PUD Lease,
except (1) decreases in connection with those operations in which the Seller
or the Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, subject to Section 6.4, may
elect after the date hereof to be a nonconsenting co-owner, (2) decreases
resulting from reversion of interest to co-owners with respect to operations
in which such co-owners elect, after the date hereof, not to consent, (3)
decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after the date
hereof, of pools or units, (4) decreases required to allow other working
interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to make up past
under deliveries and (5) as otherwise expressly stated in Exhibit B-2 or D-2;



 

24 (ii) Obligates the Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, as

not greater than the "working interest" shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 without
increase throughout the productive life of such Unit or Well, except as
stated in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 and except increases resulting from
contribution requirements with respect to defaulting co-owners under
applicable operating agreements or applicable Law and increases that

than Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Defect_ " means any lien,
charge, encumbrance, obligation or defect including without limitation a

Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean any right, circumstance or
condition that operates to increase the net revenue interest of a Seller or
Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary in any Unit, Well or PUD Lease above

proportionate increase in such Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the
Subsidiarys working interest above that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2.

Section 3.3 _Definition of Permitted Encumbrances_. As used herein, the term "
_Permitted Encumbrances_ " means any or all of the following:

(a) Lessors royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests
and other burdens to the extent that they do not, individually or in
the aggregate, reduce a Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys
net revenue interests below that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 or increase a
Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys working interests above
that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 without a corresponding increase in the net
revenue interest;

(b) All leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements,
production sales contracts, division orders and other contracts, agreements

the Subsidiarys net revenue interests below that shown in Exhibits B-2 and
D-2 or increase a Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys
working interests above that shown in Exhibits B-2 and D-2 without a
corresponding increase in the net revenue interest;

(c) Rights of first refusal, preferential purchase rights and similar rights
with respect to the Assets;

(d) Third-party consent requirements and similar restrictions which are not
applicable to the sale of the Interests contemplated by this Agreement

expired or which need not be satisfied prior to a transfer;

(e) Liens for Taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, being
contested in good faith by appropriate actions;

(f) Materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees,

in good faith by appropriate actions;

(g) All rights to consent, by required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance

(h) Rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release
the Assets, or any of them;

(i) Easements, rights-of-way, covenants, servitudes, permits, surface leases
and other rights in respect of surface operations to the extent they do not,
individually or in the aggregate, reduce a Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or
the Subsidiarys net revenue interest below that shown on Exhibit A-2 or
increase a Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys working
interest beyond that shown on Exhibit A-2 without a corresponding increase in
net revenue interest or which do not prevent or unreasonably and adversely
affect operations as currently conducted on the lands covered by the Assets;

(j) Calls on production under: (i) existing Contracts that provide that the
holder of such call on production must pay an index-based price for any
production purchased by virtue of such call on production; and (ii) those
Contracts identified on Schedule 3.3(j);

(k) Any termination of any Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the

DEPI has knowledge thereof as of the date hereof;

 

(l) All rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authorities to
control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner or to assess Tax
with respect to the Assets, the ownership, use or operation thereof, or
revenue, income or capital gains with respect thereto, and all obligations and
duties under all applicable Laws of any such Governmental Authority or under
any franchise, grant, license or permit issued by any Governmental Authority
which do not prevent or unreasonably and adversely affect operations as
currently conducted on the lands covered by the Assets;

(m) Any lien, charge or other encumbrance on or affecting the Assets which is
expressly waived, assumed, bonded or paid by Purchaser at or prior to Closing
or which is discharged by Sellers, any Wholly-Owned Company or any Subsidiary
at or prior to Closing;



 

26 (n) any lien or trust arising in connection with workers compensation,
unemployment insurance, pension or employment laws or regulations;

(o) The matters described in Schedule 4.4;

(p) Any matters shown on Exhibits B-2 and D-2; and

(q) Any other liens, charges, encumbrances, defects or irregularities which do
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the use or ownership of the Assets subject thereto
or affected thereby (as currently used or owned) and which would be accepted
by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning and
operating oil and gas properties, including, without limitation (in each case
to the extent the same would be accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser
engaged in the business of owning and operating oil and gas properties), the
absence of any lease amendment or consent by any royalty interest or mineral
interest holder authorizing the pooling of any leasehold interest, royalty
interest or mineral interest and the failure of Exhibits B-1, B-2, D-1 and D-2
to reflect any lease or any unleased mineral interest where the owner thereof
was treated as a non-participating co-tenant during the drilling of any well.

Section 3.4 _Allocated Values_. The " _Allocated Value_ " for any Well, Unit
or PUD Lease equals the portion of the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price for
the Company Shares or Additional Asset group to which such Well, Unit or PUD
Lease is related that is allocated to such Well, Unit or PUD Lease on the
Allocated Values Schedule, increased or decreased by a share of each
adjustment to the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price under Sections 2.3(c),
(d), (e), (f), (g) and (h). The share of each adjustment allocated to a
particular Well, Unit or PUD Lease shall be obtained by taking the portion of
that adjustment allocated on the Interests Schedule to the Shares or
Additional Asset group to which the Well, Unit or PUD Lease is related and
further allocating that portion among the various Assets related to such
Shares or Additional Asset group on a pro rata basis in proportion to the
Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to each such Asset. Sellers have
accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

Section 3.5 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 3.1, Purchaser must
deliver a claim notice or notices to DEPI on or before September 3, 2008 (the
" _Title Claim Date_ "). Each such notice shall be in writing and shall
include:

(i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s);

(ii) the Units, Wells or PUD Leases affected;

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Units, Wells or PUD Leases subject to the
alleged Title Defect(s);

 



 

27 (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Sellers (as well as any
title attorney or examiner hired by Sellers) to verify the existence of the
alleged Title Defect(s); and

(v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Values of
those Units, Wells or PUD Leases are reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s)
and the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based.

Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of Section 3.1 of which
Sellers have not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

(b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the
Title Claim Date, deliver to DEPI a notice including:

(i) a description of the Title Benefit;

(ii) the Units, Wells or PUD Leases affected;

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Units, Wells or PUD Leases subject to such
Title Benefit; and

(iv) the amount by which the Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value
of those Units, Wells or PUD Leases is increased by the Title Benefit, and
the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based.

Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser
a similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title
Benefit discovered by Sellers. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived all
Title Benefits of which no Party has given notice on or before the Title
Claim Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice which
it was obligated to give under this Section 3.5(b).

(c) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before seventy-five (75) days
after the Title Claim Date any Title Defects of which Sellers have been
advised by Purchaser. No reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase
Price with respect to a Title Defect for purposes of Closing. If the Title
Defect is not cured as agreed by Sellers and Purchaser at the end of
the seventy-five (75) day post-Title Claim Date period, or if Sellers and
Purchaser cannot agree, and it is determined by the Title Arbitrator that such
Title Defect is not cured at the end of the seventy-five (75) day post-Title
Claim Date period, the adjustment required under this Article 3 shall be made
pursuant to Section 8.4(b). Sellers election to attempt to cure a Title
Defect shall not constitute a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect.

(d) With respect to each Unit, Well or PUD Lease affected by Title Defects
reported under Section 3.5(a), the Unit, Well or PUD Lease shall, if an
Additional Asset, be assigned at Closing or, if held by a Wholly-Owned Company
or the Subsidiary, remain in the Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary,
subject in each case to all uncured Title Defects, and (subject to Section
3.5(c) and the remainder of this Section 3.5(d)) the Unadjusted Purchase Price
 



 

28  shall be reduced by an amount (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") equal to the
reduction in the Allocated Value for such Unit, Well or PUD Lease caused by
such Title Defects, as determined pursuant to Section 3.5(g). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5(d), no reduction shall be made in
the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect that is: 

(i) older than ten (10) years old and, except for unreleased production
payments or similar interests or unreleased encumbrances, a Title Defect
Amount of less than Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (if such Title
Defect has not resulted in the suspense of the payment of proceeds of
production);

(ii) involves a counterparty no longer in existence or in bankruptcy or
receivership; or

(iii) consists of an alleged defect in the authorization, execution, delivery,
acknowledgement, or approval of any instrument in a Sellers, Wholly-Owned
Companys or the Subsidiarys chain of title; and

in the case of each of subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) above, for which DEPI
at its election executes and delivers to Purchaser a separate written
indemnity agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, under which DEPI agrees to fully, unconditionally and
irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its successors and
assigns from any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from such Title
Defect.

(e) With respect to each Unit, Well or PUD Lease affected by Title Benefits
reported under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported under
Section 3.5(b)), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by
an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the
Allocated Value for such Unit, Well or PUD Lease caused by such Title
Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.5(h), but in no event will the
aggregate adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of Title
Benefits exceed the aggregate adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price due
to Title Defects.

(f) This Article 3 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to DEPIs breach
of its warranty and representation in Section 3.1. Except as provided in this
Article 3 and the Conveyances, Purchaser releases, remises and forever
discharges Sellers and their Affiliates and all such parties stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives from any
and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, in law or
in equity, known or unknown, which Purchaser might now or subsequently may
have, based on, relating to or arising out of, any Title Defect or other
deficiency in title to any Asset.

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;



 

29 (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the
appropriate Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys interest in
the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for any Unit, Well or PUD Lease and (B) the net revenue interest or
percentage stated on Exhibit B-2 or D-2 (as appropriate), then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Unit, Well
or PUD Lease multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net
revenue interest or percentage ownership decrease and the denominator of which
is the net revenue interest or percentage ownership stated on Exhibit B-2 or
D-2, provided that if the Title Defect does not affect the Unit, Well or PUD
Lease throughout its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount
determined under this Section 3.5(g)(iii) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease
of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Unit, Well or PUD Lease so affected, the portion of the
respective Sellers, Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys interest in
the Unit, Well or PUD Lease affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of
the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the
life of the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease, the values placed upon the
Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other factors as are necessary
to make a proper evaluation;

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) an
individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given prior
to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with respect
thereto exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($2,500,000), (B)
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any given Unit, Well or PUD Lease shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Unit, Well or PUD Lease and (C) there shall be no adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price for Title Defects unless and until the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts that are entitled to an adjustment under Section
3.5(g)(v)(A) and for which Claim Notices were timely delivered exceed Twenty-
Five Million dollars ($25,000,000), and then only to the extent that such
aggregate Title Defect Amounts exceed Twenty-Five Million dollars
($25,000,000);

(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title
Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) or (iv) above shall not be
greater than the amount that can reasonably be shown to be the reasonable
cost and expense of curing such Title Defect; and

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.



 

30 (h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the
denominator of which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit B-2 or D-2,
provided that if the Title Benefit does not affect a Unit, Well or PUD Lease
throughout the entire life of such Unit, Well or PUD Lease, the Title Benefit
Amount determined under this Section 3.5(h) shall be reduced to take into
account the applicable time period only. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 3, (A) an individual claim for a Title Benefit which
is reported under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported
under Section 3.5(b)) prior to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title
Benefit Amount with respect thereto exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Thousand
dollars ($2,500,000).

(i) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts by ten (10) Business Days after the Title Claim
Date. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, the Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and
finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.5(i). Within
twenty (20) Business Days following the Title Claim Date, Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to a title
attorney with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas titles in the state
in which the Units, Wells or PUD Leases (or majority of Units, Wells or PUD
Leases) in question are located as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser
and DEPI on behalf of Sellers or absent such agreement during the 10 Business
Day period, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association
(the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). Likewise, if by the end of the seventy-five (75)
day post-Title Claim Date cure period under Section 3.5(c), Sellers and
Purchaser have been unable to agree upon whether any Title Defects have been
cured, or Sellers have failed to cure any Title Defects which they provided
notice that they would attempt to cure, and Sellers and Purchaser have been
unable to agree on the Title Defect Amounts for such Title Defects, the cure
and/or Title Defect Amounts in dispute shall be submitted to the Title
Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall not have worked as an employee or
outside counsel for either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5)
year period preceding the arbitration or have any financial interest in the
dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall
be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be
made within 45 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
Section 3.5(g) and 3.5(h) and may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. Additionally, the Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested third Persons to advise the arbitrator, including title
attorneys from other states and petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Title Defect cures and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any
Party with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Purchaser shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, and DEPI shall be
responsible for the remaining one-half of the costs and expenses.



 

31 Section 3.6 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase_.

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send (i) notices
to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on
Schedule 4.11 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.11
in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such
rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing
of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8\. The consideration payable under
this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase
right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset. Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and
waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise
thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Sellers
shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the
benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents
and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate, and after Closing shall cause the
Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary to cooperate, with Sellers in
seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential
rights.

(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is
prohibited or a fee is payable (unless the same has been paid by Purchaser)
without the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement
is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Lease(s) to which the Contract
relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived
consent requirement, Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract
can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, the Contract
shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all
amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
performance of any obligations under such Contract to the extent that
Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to perform under such
Contract until such consent is obtained. In cases in which the Asset subject
to such a requirement is a Lease and the third Person consent to the transfer
of the Lease is not obtained by Closing, Purchaser may elect to treat the
unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title Defect and receive the appropriate
adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 by giving DEPI
written notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.5(a), except that such
notice may be given up to six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If
an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.5 is subsequently satisfied
prior to the date of the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
under Section 8.4(b), Sellers shall be reimbursed in that final adjustment
for the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price,
the Lease, if not previously transferred to Purchaser under the first sentence
of this Section 3.6(b), shall be transferred, and the provisions of this
Section 3.6 shall no longer apply to such consent requirement.



 

32 (c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for
such Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing if owned
by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be
deleted from Exhibits B and/or D to this Agreement, as applicable, for all
purposes.

(d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to
purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for
exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 3.6, such Assets shall be included in the
transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price at
Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and Sellers
shall, at their sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall continue
to be responsible for the compliance therewith.

(e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise the
same (whether before or after Closing), then:

(i) If the affected Assets are owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves,
DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves shall convey them to the holder on the terms and
provisions set out in the applicable preferential right provision. If the
affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser
agrees to transfer the affected Assets back to the applicable Seller on the
terms and provisions set out herein to permit such Seller to comply with this
obligation (or, if the applicable Seller so requests, shall transfer the
affected Assets directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in
the applicable preferential purchase right provision);

(ii) If the affected Assets are owned by a Wholly-Owned Company or the
Subsidiary, the Company or Subsidiary shall transfer them to the holder on the
terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential purchase right
provision. If Closing has already occurred, Purchaser shall cause the Company
or Subsidiary to perform this obligation;

(iii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), the applicable Seller(s) shall credit
Purchaser with the Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to
Section 3.6(e)(i) or (e)(ii);

(iv) Such Seller(s) shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder
(which shall, if received by a Company or Subsidiary after Closing, be paid to
such Seller(s) by such Company or Subsidiary or by Purchaser as agent for and
on behalf of such Company or Subsidiary);

(v) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves and
were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchase Price
adjustments calculated in the same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3(h)
shall be calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the date of the
reconveyance and the net amount of such adjustment, if positive, shall be
paid by Purchaser to such Seller and, if negative, by such Seller to
Purchaser;



 

33 (vi) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves and were
previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves, as
applicable, shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser with respect to
such Assets under Section 12.1, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by or arising out of
or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such Asset from the
Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding, however, any such
Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by the actions of, or
implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned
Company or the Subsidiary after Closing, breach of any contract by Purchaser
or any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary after Closing, or gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned Company
or the Subsidiary after Closing; and

(vii) In the event that the value of any Property operated by any Seller,
Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary is materially impaired by the exercise
of a preferential purchase right with respect to a Property also operated by
such Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary on which infrastructure
is used by the first Property without the benefit of an agreement for such use
which would survive the transfer of title to the third party preferential
purchase right holder, Purchaser may claim such material impairment as a
Title Defect.

Section 3.7 _Limitations on Applicability_. The representation and warranty
in Section 3.1 shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date and shall have no
further force and effect thereafter, provided there shall be no termination of
Purchasers or Sellers rights under Section 3.5 with respect to any bona
fide Title Defect or Title Benefit claim properly reported on or before the
Title Claim Date.

or governing instruments of the Subsidiary, (ii) result in default (with due
notice or lapse of time or both) or the creation of any lien or encumbrance

Subsidiary and have made available to Purchaser for inspection the
ownership interest certificates and transfer books, and the minute books, of
the Subsidiary.

(e) _Title to Equity Interests of the Subsidiary_. The issued and outstanding
membership interests in the Subsidiary are owned of record as described in

governing instruments. Other than this Agreement and the ownership agreement

and outstanding partnership interests of DEPI Survivor LP shall then become
Shares for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be transferred to
two Delaware limited liability companies each of which is wholly-owned by
Purchaser as part of the Interests at Closing. Prior to Closing, DOTEPI shall
cause DNG I, LP to undergo a multi-survivor merger under which DNG I, LP is

transferred to two Delaware limited liability companies each of which is
wholly-owned by Purchaser as part of the Interests at Closing. DEPI shall
bear and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the Companies and the
Subsidiary from and against all costs incurred in connection with the multi-

agrees to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for
carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement.

expense of Purchaser, statements of revenues and direct operating expenses
for the EandP Business for the most recent three (3) fiscal years ending prior

such lesser period as determined by Purchaser) related thereto that will be
required of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with their Form
8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
pursuant to the Exchange Act related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, together with any quarterly or interim period statement of revenues
and direct operating expenses required in connection with such Form 8-K filing

provide suitable electronic detail in the form of lease operating statements
by property adequately supporting all statements provided.

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall request Deloitte
and Touche LLP, Sellers external auditor (" _Deloitte_ "), after discussing
specifications with Purchaser, to (i) perform an audit of the Statements of
Revenues and Expenses on Purchasers behalf and to issue its opinion with
respect to the Statements of Revenues and Expenses for the period(s) specified
by Purchaser (the Statements of Revenues and Expenses and related audit
opinions being hereinafter referred to as the " _Audited Statements of Revenue
and Expenses_ ") and (ii) provide its written consent for the use of its audit
reports with respect to Statements of Revenues and Expenses in reports filed
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as required by such Laws. Both DEPI, DRI or one of their Affiliates and
Purchaser shall sign the engagement letter for Deloitte and provide
such information as may be reasonably requested from time to time by
Deloitte. Purchaser shall bear all fees charged by Deloitte pursuant to such
engagement. Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to cause Deloitte to: (i)
provide Purchaser a fee estimate before commencing the audit and (ii) provide
timely budget versus actual comparisons to Purchaser. Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate in the completion of such audit and delivery of the Audited
Statements of Revenue and Expenses to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as
soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than fifteen (15) days prior to
the  



 

55  last due date that such Audited Statements of Revenue and Expenses would be
required to be filed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with a report on
Form 8-K or an amendment thereto under the Exchange Act. Sellers shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the progress of such audit and provide
a reasonably complete draft of the statements of revenues and expenses within
45 days after Closing.

(c) Sellers and their Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and
provide Purchaser and KPMG LLP with reasonable access during normal business
hours to their records (to the extent such information is then available) and
personnel as Purchaser may reasonably require to enable Purchaser to review

contemplated by Section 6.18(a) or any other required reports, at Purchasers
sole expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Sellers and
their Affiliates be required to create new records relating to the
Assets pursuant to this Section 6.18(c) and the access to be provided to
Purchaser and KPMG LLP pursuant to this Section 6.18(c) shall not interfere
with Sellers and such Affiliates ability to prepare its own financial
statements or its regular conduct of business.

(d) Purchaser shall promptly reimburse DEPI on behalf of Sellers and their
Affiliates for all internal and external expenses incurred by Sellers and
their Affiliates pursuant to this Section 6.18.

that all of DEPIs, DOTEPIs and Reserves right, title and interest in
overriding royalties located in San Juan and Rio Arriba Counties, New Mexico
(the " _Carlsbad Royalties_ ") are to be excluded at Closing as part of the
Excluded Assets. Sellers were not able to complete the exclusion of the
Carlsbad Royalties from Exhibit D-1 prior to the date hereof. Sellers agree to
deliver to Purchaser, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof, a supplement to Exhibit D-1 excluding all Carlsbad Royalties not
already excluded from Exhibit D-1. Such supplement shall be deemed to be a
part of Exhibit D-1 for all purposes of this Agreement and the Carlsbad
Royalties shall be Excluded Assets for all purposes of this Agreement.

60 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
later of (i) the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day following the Closing
Date and (ii) the date on which the parties or the Title Arbitrator, as

Purchaser and Sellers (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "), for review and final
determination by arbitration. Should Ernst and Young LLP fail or refuse to

replacement Accounting Arbitrator within ten (10) days after the end of that
twenty (20) day period, or should no replacement Accounting Arbitrator agree
to serve within forty-five (45) days after the original written request
pursuant to this sentence, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be appointed by
the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section. The Accounting Arbitrators determination shall be made within forty-
five (45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be bound by the terms of Section 2.3 and may not increase the Purchase
Price more than the increase proposed by Sellers nor decrease the Purchase
Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as applicable. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed aspects of Purchase Price adjustments
submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest (except as
expressly provided for in this Section) or penalties to any Party with respect
to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case. DEPI shall bear one-half and Purchaser
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator.
Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchasers
sixty (60) day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii)
the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Arbitrator finally determine
the Interest Purchase Prices, (x) Purchaser shall pay to each Seller the
amount by which the portion of any Interest Purchase Price(s) to which that
Seller is entitled exceeds the portion of the Closing Payment received by that
Seller or (y) each Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the
portion of the Closing Payment received by that Seller exceeds portion of the
any Interest Purchase Price(s) to which that Seller is entitled, as
applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall bear
interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Agreed Rate.



 

61 (c) Purchaser shall assist Sellers, to the extent reasonably necessary, in
preparation of the final statement of the Interest Purchase Prices under
Section 8.4(b) by furnishing invoices, receipts, reasonable access to
personnel and such other assistance as may be requested by Seller to
facilitate such process post-Closing.

set forth on Schedule 8.4(d), for the credit of the applicable Sellers, or to
such other bank and account as may be specified by Sellers in writing. All
payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic
transfer or immediately available funds to a bank and account specified by
Purchaser in writing to Sellers, for the credit of Purchaser.

ARTICLE 9\.

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1 _Liability for Taxes_.

(a) _Taxes with Respect to Additional Assets_. Subject to Sections 9.1(e) and
9.1(f), from and after Closing, DEPI shall be liable for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser and each of the Wholly-Owned Companies and
the Subsidiary from and against, all Taxes with respect to the Additional
Assets attributable to any Pre-Closing Period including income Taxes arising
as a result of any Sellers gain on the sale of the Additional Assets as
contemplated by this Agreement. From and after Closing, Purchaser shall be
liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and its
Affiliates from and against, all such Taxes attributable to any Post-Closing
Period. Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers or their Affiliates for any Taxes
with respect to the Additional Assets attributable to any Post-Closing Period
that are paid by Sellers or their Affiliates no later than twenty (20)
calendar days after the Purchasers receipt of notice from DEPI of
Purchasers liability therefor. DEPI shall reimburse Purchaser for any Taxes
with respect to the Additional Assets attributable to any Pre-Closing Period
that are paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates no later than twenty (20)
calendar days after DEPIs receipt of notice from Purchaser of DEPIs
liability therefor.

(b) _Pre-Closing Taxes of Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary_. Subject
to Sections 9.1(e), from and after Closing, DEPI shall be liable for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and each of the Wholly-Owned
Companies and the Subsidiary from and against, any Taxes imposed on or
incurred by any Company or Subsidiary and attributable to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or to the portion, determined as
described in Section 9.1(d), of any taxable period beginning on or prior to
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date which is allocable to the
portion of such period occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Period_ ").

(c) _Post-Closing Taxes of Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary_. From
and after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless  



 

62  each Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any Taxes imposed on or
incurred by a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary and attributable to any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, or to the portion,
determined as described in Section 9.1(d), of any taxable period beginning on
or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date which is
allocable to the portion of such period occurring after the Closing Date (the
" _Post-Closing Period_ ").

(d) _Straddle Period Taxes_. Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this
Agreement to determine the portion of any Taxes or earnings and profits of or
with respect to any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary for a taxable
period beginning on or prior to and ending after the Closing Date (each such
period, a " _Straddle Period_ ") which is attributable or allocable to the
Pre-Closing Period or the Post-Closing Period, the determination shall be made
as if each of the Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary was not a member
of its respective Sellers consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group
for Tax purposes and, any Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period that are
based on or related to income, gains or receipts will be computed (by an
interim closing of the books) as if such taxable period ended as of the
Closing Date and any other Pre-Closing Period Taxes (except production Taxes
and other Taxes measured by units of production, and severance Taxes) will be
prorated based upon the number of days in the applicable period falling on or
before, or after, the Closing Date. To the extent necessary, a Seller shall
estimate Taxes based on the Sellers liability for Taxes with respect to the
same or similar Tax Item (as defined in Section 9.2(a)) in the immediately
preceding year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) any
franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to each Wholly-Owned Company or the
Subsidiary shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income,
operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured,
regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is
obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax and (ii) any ad valorem or
property Taxes paid or payable with respect to the Assets shall be allocated
to the taxable period applicable to the ownership of the Assets regardless of
when such Taxes are assessed. Sellers shall, within 60 days after
the determination of the Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b), prepare for
Purchaser a pro forma Tax Return for any taxable period beginning on or
before, but ending after, the Closing Date, that shall include, pursuant to
the method described in this Section 9.1(d), the income Tax liability
associated with the Companies for the period beginning on the first day of
such taxable period and ending on the Closing Date. Such pro forma Tax Return
shall be used by Purchaser for purposes of preparing a Tax Return for such
Straddle Period.

(e) _Period After Effective Date_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event Closing occurs after the Effective Date, from
and after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any Taxes (including
Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, but excluding federal income
Taxes and state and local Taxes determined using federal income tax
principles, production Taxes and other Taxes measured by units of production,
and severance Taxes) that are allocable to the period from but excluding the
Effective Date to and including the Closing Date, and shall reimburse any such
Seller or Affiliate for any such amount paid by it (or paid prior to Closing
by any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary) no later than 20 calendar days
after the Purchasers receipt of notice from DEPI of Purchasers liability
therefor; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be obligated under this
Section 9.1(e) for any Taxes attributable to a Sellers gain on the sale of
Interests as contemplated by this Agreement. The amount of Taxes allocable to
the time period described in the previous sentence will be determined in a
manner similar to and consistent with the determination of Pre-Closing
Period Taxes under Section 9.1(d).



 

63 (f) _Production Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, production Taxes and other Taxes measured by units of production,
and severance Taxes, shall not be subject to Section 9.1 and responsibility
therefor and payment thereof shall be exclusively addressed by Sections
1.3(xv), 2.3, 2.4 and 8.4.

(g) _Indemnity Period_. The indemnities for Taxes provided for in this Article
9 shall not be subject to any limitation set forth in Article 12, and shall
continue until the applicable statute of limitations closes the taxable year
to which the subject Taxes relate.

Section 9.2  _Preparation and Filing of Company Tax Returns_.

(a) With respect to each Tax return, declaration, report, claim for refund
or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule
or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof (a " _Tax Return_
") that is required to be filed for, by or with respect to a Wholly-Owned
Company or the Subsidiary with respect to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause such Tax Return to be
prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all items of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit or other items (collectively " _Tax Items_
") required to be included therein and shall cause the Wholly-Owned Company or
the Subsidiary to timely file (assuming it has authority to do so) such Tax
Return with the appropriate taxing authority and shall timely pay the amount
of Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return.

(b) With respect to each Tax Return that is required to be filed for, by or
with respect to a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary with respect to a
taxable period ending after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause such Tax
Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax
Items required to be included therein, and shall cause each Wholly-Owned
Company or the Subsidiary to file timely such Tax Return with the appropriate
taxing authority and shall pay timely the amount of Taxes shown to be due on
such Tax Return.

(c) Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Article
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior
years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for changes required by
changes in Law.

(d) If either (i) DEPI or Purchaser may be liable for any material portion of
the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be filed or caused to be
filed by the other (or, in the case of Purchaser, by any Seller) (or any Tax
Item reported on such Tax Return is likely to materially affect the Tax
liability of such Party) or (ii) in any case with respect to any taxable
period beginning on or before but ending after the Closing Date, the Party
responsible under this Agreement for filing such return or causing such
return to be filed (the " _Tax Return Preparer_ ") shall prepare and deliver
to the other Party (the " _Tax Payor_ ") a copy of such return and any
schedules, work papers and other documentation then available that are
relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return for which the Tax
Payor is or may be liable under this Agreement not later than forty-five (45)
days before the date on which the Tax Return is due to be filed (taking into
account any valid extensions) (the " _Due Date_ "). The Tax Return Preparer  



 

64  shall not file such return or cause such return to be filed until the
earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Tax Payor indicating
the Tax Payors consent thereto, or the Due Date. The Tax Payor shall have
the option of providing to the Tax Return Preparer, at any time at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how the
Tax Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable (or any
item that is likely to affect the Tax liability of such party) reflected on
such Tax Return. The Tax Return Preparer shall, in preparing such return, but
subject to Section 9.2(c), cause the items for which the Tax Payor is liable
under this Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the Tax Payors
instructions unless, in the opinion of a partner of a nationally recognized
law firm retained by the Tax Return Preparer, complying with the Tax Payors
instructions would more likely than not subject the Tax Return Preparer to any
criminal penalty or to civil penalties under sections 6662 through 6664 of the
Code or similar provisions of applicable state, local or foreign Law, or
unless complying with the Tax Payors instructions would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Tax Return Preparer or its Affiliates or would be
inconsistent with past practice.

Section 9.3 _Allocation Arrangements_. Effective as of the Closing, any tax
indemnity, sharing, allocation or similar agreement or arrangement (a " _Tax
Sharing Agreement_ ") that may be in effect prior to the Closing Date between
or among, a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, on the one hand, and its
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and Subsidiary), on
the other hand, shall be extinguished in full as the Tax Sharing Agreement
relates to such Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, and any liabilities or
rights existing under any such agreement or arrangement by or with respect to
a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary shall cease to exist and shall no
longer be enforceable.

Section 9.4 _Access to Information_.

(a) From and after Closing, each Seller shall grant, and shall cause its
Affiliates to grant, to Purchaser (or its designees) access at all reasonable
times to all of the information, books and records relating to a Wholly-Owned
Company or the Subsidiary or the Assets within the possession of the Seller or
its Affiliates (including without limitation work papers and correspondence
with taxing authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client
communications with any of Sellers legal counsel and personnel files), and
shall afford Purchaser (or its designees) the right (at Purchasers expense)
to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Purchaser (or its designees) to prepare Tax
Returns, to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties
arising under, this Agreement.

(b) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Sellers (or Sellers
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and
records relating to the Wholly-Owned Companies or the Subsidiary within the
possession of Purchaser or the Wholly-Owned Companies or the Subsidiary
(including without limitation work papers and correspondence with taxing
authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client communications
with any of Purchasers legal counsel and personnel files), and shall
afford Sellers (or Sellers designees) the right (at Sellers expense) to
take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Sellers (or Sellers designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to
conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions
of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties arising under,
this Agreement.



  

65 (c) Each of the Parties hereto will preserve and retain all schedules, work
papers and other documents relating to any Tax Returns of or with respect to
Taxes of the Wholly-Owned Companies or the Subsidiary or to any claims, audits
or other proceedings affecting the Wholly-Owned Companies or the Subsidiary
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions)
applicable to the taxable period to which such documents relate or until the
final determination of any controversy with respect to such taxable period,
and until the final determination of any payments that may be required with
respect to such taxable period under this Agreement.

(d) At any Partys request, the other Parties shall provide reasonable access
to such Partys and its Affiliates (including the Wholly-Owned Companies and
the Subsidiarys) personnel who have knowledge of the information described in
this Section 9.4.

Section 9.5 _Contest Provisions_.

(a) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand (the "
_Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief tax officer (or other
appropriate person) of DEPI or Purchaser, as the case may be (the " _Tax
Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the
Tax Indemnified Person of written notice of any pending or threatened audits,
adjustments, claims, examinations, assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax
Audit_ ") which are likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other
party. If the Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice to the
other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any
Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit if such failure to give
notice materially adversely affects the other partys right to participate in
the Tax Audit.

(b) If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only DEPI
would be liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement, DEPI shall have
the option, at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
beginning after the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only Purchaser
would be liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall, at its expense,
control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent that such
Tax Audit relates to Tax Items for which Purchaser is liable to indemnify DEPI
under Section 9.1. 

(c) If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both DEPI and Purchaser could
be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, such Tax Items
will be distinguished and each Party will have the option to control the
defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such Tax
Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or before
and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be identified as
being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for
which the other party is liable, DEPI, at its expense, shall have the option
to control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit, provided that such
party defends the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return and provided
further that no such matter shall be settled without the written consent of
both parties, not to be unreasonably withheld.



 

66 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party whose liability
for Taxes for any period may be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense and shall have the right to consent to any settlement of such
Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the extent that such
settlement would have an adverse effect with respect to a period for which
that party is liable for Taxes, under this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 9.6 _Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Seller s Tax Liability_.

(a) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall not and
shall not permit its Affiliates, including the Wholly-Owned Companies and the
Subsidiary, to take any action on or after the Closing Date which could
increase any Sellers liability for Taxes (including any liability of DEPI to
indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under this Agreement).

(b) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, DEPI and Sellers shall
not, and shall not permit their Affiliates, to take any action on or
after the Closing Date which could materially increase any Purchasers or its
Affiliates, including any Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys,
liability for Taxes (including any liability of to indemnify for Taxes under
this Agreement).

(c) Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, Purchaser shall not and
shall not permit its Affiliates, including the Wholly-Owned Companies and the
Subsidiary, to amend any Tax Return with respect to a taxable period for which
DEPI may be liable to indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under Section 9.1.

Section 9.7 _Refunds_.

(a) Purchaser agrees to pay to DEPI any refund received (whether by payment,
credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any interest thereon) after the
Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including the Wholly-Owned Companies
and the Subsidiary, in respect of any Taxes for which DEPI is liable or
required to indemnify Purchaser under Section 9.1. Purchaser shall cooperate
with DEPI and DEPIs Affiliates in order to take all necessary steps to claim
any such refund. Any such refund received by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
the Wholly-Owned Companies or the Subsidiary shall be paid to DEPI within
thirty (30) days after such refund is received. Purchaser agrees to notify
DEPI within ten (10) days following the discovery of a right to claim any
such refund and upon receipt of any such refund. Purchaser agrees to claim any
such refund as soon as possible after the discovery of a right to claim a
refund and to furnish to DEPI all information, records and assistance
necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

(b) Purchaser shall make, and shall cause the Wholly-Owned Companies and the
Subsidiary to make, elections under Section 172(b)(3) and any other applicable
provision of the Code and Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) and §
1.1502-21T(b)(3)(ii)(B) and any other applicable Treasury Regulations, and
under any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign tax law in any
state, locality or foreign jurisdiction in which any Wholly-Owned Company or
the Subsidiary files a combined, consolidated or unitary return with
any Seller, to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to any Tax
Item of any Wholly-Owned  



 

67  Company or the Subsidiary arising in any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date that could be carried back to a taxable year of such Wholly-
Owned Company or the Subsidiary ending before the Closing Date.

Section 9.8 _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Article 9 and any other provision of this Agreement, except Section 13.3
hereof, this Article 9 shall control.

Section 9.9 _Election Under Section 338(h)(10)_. Sellers and Purchaser agree
that they shall make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
under any comparable provisions of state or local law with respect to the
purchase of the Interests (other than Interests in any Company or Subsidiary
that is not a member of a selling consolidated group within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations § 1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(2)). Purchaser shall prepare copies
of IRS Form 8023 and any similar state or local forms, partially completed
with the identity of the parties, and shall deliver them to Sellers at least
five days prior to Closing. Sellers shall execute such forms at Closing and
shall deliver them to Purchaser. Purchaser shall execute and complete copies
of IRS Form 8023 and similar state or local forms, with the advice and consent
of Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld) not later than sixty (60) days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such forms or the Tax
Returns to which such forms must be attached. If any changes are required in
these forms as a result of information that is first available after such
forms are completed, the parties will promptly agree on such changes. Except
to the extent required by applicable Law, neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall
take any action inconsistent with, or fail to take any action necessary for,
the validity of the election described in this Section 9.9.

ARTICLE 10\.

U.S. EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

Section 10.1 _Employees_.

(a) " _Company Onshore Employees_ " shall mean all those individuals other
than Excluded Employees (i) who are either Designated Employees or Selected
Employees and (ii) who accept an offer of employment with whichever of
Purchaser or its Affiliates is designated by Purchaser in its sole discretion
to make the offer of employment pursuant to Section 10.2 and who are credited
with at least one (1) hour of service for Purchaser or its Affiliates.

(b) " _Designated Employees_ " are those individuals (i) who, as of the
Closing Date are (x) employed by DEPI, DOTEPI, Reserves, the Wholly-Owned
Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries and are rendering services primarily
with respect to the Assets or (y) employed by Dominion Resources Services,
Inc. and are rendering services primarily with respect to the Assets or (z)
employed pursuant to the college recruiting program of the Companies or their
Affiliates with respect to the Assets and (ii) who are not U.S. Temporary
Employees. Seller shall provide Purchaser and its Affiliates not later than
thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement the individuals to whom
Purchaser or its Affiliates must offer employment in accordance with Section
10.2(a). Seller will make good faith effort to provide the list in less than
thirty (30) days. In no event shall the number of Designated Employees exceed
207 unless Purchaser approves a higher number.



 

68 (c) " _Selected Employees_ " are those individuals (i) who, as of the Closing
Date are (x) employed by DEPI, DOTEPI, Reserves, the Wholly-Owned Companies
or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries and are rendering services with respect to the
Assets or (y) employed by Dominion Resources Services, Inc. and are rendering
services with respect to the Assets, (ii) who are not U.S. Temporary
Employees and (iii) who are selected by Purchaser and its Affiliates from a
list provided to Purchaser and its Affiliates not later than forty (40) days
after the execution of this Agreement the individuals to whom Purchaser or
its Affiliates must offer employment in accordance with Section 10.2(a).

(d) From the date hereof through a date eighteen (18) months from the Closing
Date, none of Purchaser, its Affiliates, its wholly-owned Affiliates
designated to receive conveyances pursuant to Section 8.2, or any of its other
Affiliates which have assisted Purchaser with or otherwise participated in
the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement will, directly or
indirectly, solicit (provided that in no event will general advertising be
deemed solicitation for purposes of this Section 10.1(d)), or offer
employment to any other employee of any of Sellers or their Affiliates without
the prior written consent of DEPI.

Section 10.2 _Employment_.

(a) Subject to the above, Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to employ
Designated Employees or to pay to Sellers a dollar amount representing the
value of the severance those individuals to whom Purchaser does not make an
offer of employment would have received under Section 10.2(c) had they been
employed by Purchaser and later involuntarily terminated without cause, and
which Sellers terminate their employment without cause within twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to employ
Company Onshore Employees effective as of the date as of which such employee
is credited with one (1) hour of service for Purchaser or its Affiliates.
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause the Purchaser or its Affiliate who is
the employer of such employees to employ such employees for a period of at
least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (i) at levels of total
compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and benefits, including the
amounts provided in this Section 10.2, that are comparable, in the aggregate,
to the levels total cash compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and
benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the levels of total cash
compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and benefits as noted under the
Plans and Programs on Schedule 4.2(j)(i) in effect as of the Closing Date and
(ii) at a work location no more than 50 miles from the individuals work
location as of the Closing Date. In determining comparability for the twelve
(12) month period following the Closing, in no event will the base pay and
annual incentive bonus opportunity for each such employee be less than his or
her base pay and annual incentive bonus opportunity with Seller as of the
Closing Date. In determining comparability, any long term incentive
opportunity, retention plans or retention programs, gross-up payments due to
tax penalties resulting from Code Section 280G and 4999, Six Sigma and Spot
Cash Programs listed on Part II of Schedule 4.2(j)(i), Equity-Based Programs
listed on Part III of Schedule 4.2(j)(i) and amounts paid or payable from the
Success Pool listed on Part V of Schedule 4.2(j)(i) shall be excluded.
Benefits shall be comparable to the Company Onshore Employees workforce as a
whole, and may or may not be equal to the benefits individual  



 

69  Company Onshore Employees would receive under the Plan and Programs on
Schedule 4.2(j)(i) in effect as of the Closing Date. Purchaser will have
fulfilled its comparability obligations under Section 10.2(a) with respect to
Company Onshore Employees if Purchaser complies with the requirements of (i)
Section 10.2(a) with respect to base pay and annual incentive bonus
opportunity, (ii) Section 10.5, (iii) payments of the "Special Bonus" as
outlined below, and (iv) offering participation in Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans (as defined in Section 10.4.) that will provide substantially similar
or greater value as is provided currently. Purchaser and its Affiliates will
pay, or will cause its Affiliates to pay, to each Company Onshore Employee as
of the Closing Date a special one time cash bonus that equals the sum of A
plus B, where: "A" is the product of 5.0% multiplied by the respective
Company Onshore Employees annual base salary as of their first hour of
service with Purchaser, and "B" is the amount necessary to pay the federal,
state, and local income and withholding taxes on the amount determined in A
and B (at the time payable and based on reasonable assumptions regarding the
Company Onshore Employees tax rates), with the intent that the after-tax
amount received by each Company Onshore Employee from Purchaser or its
Affiliates when paid shall be the amount calculated in A (the " _Special
Bonus_ "). One-half of the Special Bonus will be paid within 30 days of the
Closing Date and the remainder paid on the earlier of the first anniversary
of the Closing Date or the termination of such Company Onshore Employee
without cause. If the Company Onshore Employee is terminated for cause or the
Company Onshore Employee terminates his/her employment prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, then he/she shall forfeit all rights to any
remainder of the Special Bonus. Purchaser shall not be required to create any
new employee benefit plans over and above its existing Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans (as defined below), to effectuate the provision of comparable benefits
contemplated herein.

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ or continue the
employment of any Excluded Employee; provided, however, that any offer to a
Excluded Employee must include the terms and conditions specified on Schedule
10.2(c)(ii) for Managing Directors or Schedule 10.2(d) for Executives. 

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ or continue the
employment of any Selected Employee; provided, however, that any offer to an
Selected Employee must include the terms and conditions applicable to
Designated Employees in accordance with Section 10.2.

(d) If (i) the employment of any Company Onshore Employee with Purchaser is
involuntarily terminated, other than for cause under the severance plan on
Schedule 10.2(c)(i) or (ii) a Company Onshore Employee resigns his or
her employment with Purchaser by reason of the relocation, without his or her
consent, of his or her work location more than 50 miles from the individuals
work location as of the Closing Date within twelve (12) months of the Closing
Date, then, upon execution of a release of liability agreement by each
affected Company Onshore Employee, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide,
or cause to be provided, the terminated Company Onshore Employee with
whichever of the following results in the greater value to such Company
Onshore Employee: (i) salary continuation and health benefits until the end of
the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, (ii) severance
benefits which are comparable, in the aggregate, to the severance benefits
set out on Schedule 10.2(c)(i) and which, with respect to salary continuation,
health benefits, outplacement services and annual incentive plan payment are
no less than the benefits set out on Schedule 10.2(c)(i), or (iii) for Key
Employees, the severance benefits provided by the special award letters as set
out in Schedule 10.2(c)(iii).



 

70 (e) If a Designated Employee or a Selected Employee receives cash severance or
other severance related compensation or benefits from DEPI or its Affiliates
but is subsequently employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates within twelve (12)
months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser or its Affiliates shall pay
promptly to Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash severance
and other severance related compensation and benefits provided by Sellers and
their Affiliates to such employee in connection with the termination of such
employees employment with Sellers and their Affiliates. If an Executive or
Managing Director is employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates within twenty
four (24) months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
pay promptly to Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash
severance and other severance related compensation and benefits provided to
such Executive or Managing Director by Sellers and their Affiliates, if any,
in connection with the termination of such Executives or Managing
Directors employment with Sellers.

Section 10.3 _Plan Participation_. Effective as of the day after the Closing
Date, the Companies and Subsidiary shall cease to be participating employers
in all Employee Plans sponsored by Sellers or any of their ERISA Affiliates
for Company Onshore Employees (" _Company s U.S. Benefit Plans_"), all
Company Onshore Employees shall cease to accrue additional benefits for any
periods after the Closing Date, Company Onshore Employees shall be entitled to
such benefits, if any, from Companys U.S. Benefit Plans provided to similarly
situated employees employed by an entity ceasing to be an ERISA Affiliate of
Sellers (including continued benefits under flexible spending arrangements if
applicable continuation coverage is elected) and Sellers shall, if applicable,
provide all Company Onshore Employees with appropriate notice of such
cessation of participation and accruals in accordance with Section 204(h) of
ERISA and Code Section 4980F (and the related regulations), at least forty
five (45) days in advance of the Closing Date. Except as is set forth in this
Section 10.3, Section 10.2(b), Section 10.2(c), Section 10.2(d), Section 10.4,
Section 10.6 and Section 10.9, after the Closing Date, neither Purchaser and
its Affiliates nor the Companies or Subsidiary shall have any liability with
respect to any Company U.S. Benefit Plan.

Section 10.4 _Participation in Purchaser Plans_. As of the day after the
Closing Date, all Company Onshore Employees shall, if applicable, be eligible
to participate in and, if elected, shall commence participation in the
employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or arrangements (whether
written or unwritten) of Purchaser or its Affiliates covering similarly
situated employees primarily engaged with respect to operations in the
U.S. (collectively, " _Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans_ "). Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plan (provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts
to remove any restrictions including restrictions in any insurance policy),
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to such Company Onshore Employees and their spouses and
dependents, if applicable, under the Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans other
than, but only to the extent of, limitations or waiting periods that were in
effect with respect to such employees under the Companys U.S. Benefit Plans
that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plan (provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use reasonable efforts
to remove  



 

71  any restrictions under any Purchaser U.S. Employee Plan or related insurance
policy), provide each such Company Onshore Employee with credit for any year-
to-date co-payments and deductibles paid as of the Closing Date in satisfying
any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans.

Section 10.5 _Service Credit_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause to be
provided to each Company Onshore Employee credit for prior service with
Sellers or their Affiliates for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility,
benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans, including fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick leave policies,
severance plans or policies, and matching contributions under
defined contribution plans, other than for benefit accruals under defined
benefit pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
and retiree medical plans maintained or provided by Purchaser or its wholly-
owned subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such Company Onshore Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Under Purchasers vacation
plan, each Company Onshore Employee shall be entitled in 2007 to the Company
Onshore Employees earned but unused vacation as of the Closing Date. Each
Company Onshore Employee will not be allowed to carry forward any unused
vacation time beyond 2007 unless allowed under Purchasers vacation policy.
Each Onshore Employee shall receive industry service credit as provided under
Purchasers vacation policy.

Section 10.6 _Defined Contribution Plan_. To the extent allowable by law,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take any and all necessary action to cause
the trustee of a tax qualified defined contribution plan of Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Company Onshore Employee, to
accept a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees distribution
from Sellers tax qualified defined contribution plan (excluding securities,
but including plan loans from pre-tax contributions). 

Section 10.7 _Vesting_. As of the Closing Date, Sellers shall take all
necessary action to cause the tax qualified defined contribution and defined

Onshore Employees in their account balances and/or accrued benefits under such

73 Section 10.13 _No Implied Rights_. The provisions of this Article 10 are not
intended to confer on any person, other than the Parties, any rights or
remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to create or amend any
Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans, whether to reflect the terms of this Article 10
or otherwise. Nothing herein shall preclude the ability of Purchaser and its
Affiliates from amending or terminating any Purchaser U.S. Employee Plan at
anytime on or after the Closing Date without resulting in any liability
hereunder.

ARTICLE 11\.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

Section 11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to Closing: (i) by the mutual prior written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;
or (ii) by either Sellers or Purchaser, if Closing has not occurred on or
before October 1, 2007 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1 if the Closing
has failed to occur because such Party negligently or willfully failed to
perform or observe in any material respect its covenants and agreements
hereunder.

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or
effect (except for the provisions of Sections 1.2, 1.3, 4.12, 5.10, 6.3, 6.6,
11.1, 11.2, 13.1, 13.2, 13.4, 13.8, 13.9, 13.17, 13.18 and 13.19 and of the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall continue in full force and
effect). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1 shall not relieve any Party
from liability for any willful or negligent failure to perform or observe in
any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein that
were to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing. In the event this
Agreement terminates under Section 11.1 and any Party has willfully or
negligently failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed
at or prior to Closing, then the other Party, subject to Section 13.19, shall
be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be
entitled to recover court costs and attorneys fees in addition to any other
relief to which the other Party may be entitled (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, damages recoverable by the other Party for a termination under this
Article 11 shall include, without limiting similar damages of Purchaser or
Sellers to the extent not described below, all applicable damages (it being
agreed that the following damages do not constitute consequential, special,
or punitive damages for the purpose of Section 13.19) constituting: (i) all
out of pocket costs paid by it and its Affiliates in connection with the
terminated transaction, including brokers, agents, advisors and attorneys
fees; (ii) with respect to Sellers as the other Party, all costs of
additional employee retention payments and/or costs of temporary or contract
workers to replace workers departing after the termination of this transaction
for a period of one year to the extent those costs of Seller exceed the
baseline costs that would have been incurred by Seller in maintaining the
employees of Seller as if the terminated transaction had never been agreed
upon; (iii) with respect to Sellers as the other Party, the amount, if any,
by which the Unadjusted Purchase Price exceeds the aggregate unadjusted sales
price for the subsequent sale or sales comprising in aggregate the sale of the
 



 

74  Interests to a third Person or third Persons to the extent such sale or
sales are completed within a period of one year following the termination of
the transaction; and (iv) interest at the Agreed Rate on the outstanding
amount of the excess described in clause (iii) from the Target Closing Date
until the last of any such subsequent sale or sales of the Interests are
consummated not to exceed one year following the termination of the
transaction).

ARTICLE 12\.

are included in clauses (a) or (b) below), any claims regarding the general
method, manner or practice of calculating or making royalty payments with
respect to the Properties, and continuing obligations under any agreements

Schedule 4.4, regardless of the Assets to which such actions, suits or
proceedings relate;

(h) amounts owed by any Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary to any
Affiliate (other than a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary) at the end of
the Closing Date that are not incurred for the provision of goods or services,
for employment related costs, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business,
with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets; or

(i) any Current Liabilities that are composed of Property Costs that arise
between December 31, 2006 and the Effective Date that are outstanding at the
Effective Date (provided that Sellers retention of the same, and their
classification as "Retained Seller Obligations," shall terminate on the Cut-
off Date).

Section 12.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers and their current and former Affiliates (other than the
Companies and the Subsidiary) and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents (" _Seller Group_ ") from and against all Damages
incurred or suffered by Seller Group:

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the Assumed Seller
Obligations;

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or
operation of the Assets, whether before or after the Closing Date;

(iii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Purchasers breach of any
of Purchasers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6;

(iv) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any

Agreement or in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.3(d);

(v) consisting of Environmental Liabilities (except to the extent DEPI is
required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(ii) or Section
12.2(g)); or

(vi) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any transfer
of operatorship pursuant to Section 6.10.



 

76 even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any
Indemnified Person (but not such Indemnified Persons gross negligence or
willful misconduct), or a pre-existing condition, but excepting in each case
Damages against which DEPI would be required to indemnify Purchaser under
Section 12.2(b) at the time the claim notice is presented by Purchaser.

(b) From and after Closing, DEPI shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser, its current and former Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (" _Purchaser Group_ ") against and
from all Damages incurred or suffered by Purchaser Group:

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Sellers breach of any of
Sellers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6 (provided, however,
for purposes of interpretation of the preceding indemnity, Sellers covenants
and agreements qualified by "Material Adverse Effect" but not "material"
or materiality generally shall be deemed to have been made without the
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification);

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by DEPI contained in Article 4 of this
Agreement, or in the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.2(j) (provided, however, for purposes of interpretation of the preceding
indemnity, Sellers representations and warranties qualified by "Material
Adverse Effect" but not "material" or materiality generally shall be deemed
to have been made without the "Material Adverse Effect" qualification.);

(iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Retained Seller
Obligations;

(iv) caused by, arising out of or resulting from claims for injury or
death to any natural person attributable to or arising out of DEPIs,
DOTEPIs, Reserves or any Wholly-Owned Companys or the Subsidiarys
ownership or operation of the Assets or any part thereof prior to the
Effective Date; 

(v) caused by, arising out of or resulting from claims (whether brought by a
Governmental Authority, an individual pursuant to a qui tam or false claims
act proceeding, or otherwise) that DEPI, DOTEPI, Reserves or any Wholly-Owned
Company or the Subsidiary failed to pay, missed a payment of, or made an error
in the payment of, royalties (including minimum royalties, rentals, shut-in
payments and overriding royalties) during such Persons period of ownership or
operation of the Assets or any part thereof prior to the Effective Date, to
the extent attributable to such Persons failure to pay, consistent with then
current industry practices, royalties owing with respect to such Persons
share of production from specific Properties;

(vi) consisting of Environmental Liabilities for which Seller is required to
indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(ii) or Section 12.2(g));

(vii) related to off-site disposal of Hazardous Substances from the Assets
prior to the Effective Date for which the owner of the Assets may be liable;
or



 

77 (viii) constituting fines, or civil, criminal or regulatory penalties that may
be levied by a Governmental Authority for a violation of Environmental Laws
with respect to the Assets which occurred prior to the Effective Date.

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person (but not such Indemnified Persons gross negligence or
willful misconduct), or a pre-existing condition.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, Sellers and Purchasers exclusive remedy against each
other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 4, 5 and 6 (excluding
Section 6.6, which shall be separately enforceable by Sellers pursuant to
whatever rights and remedies are available to it outside of this Article 12)
and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Sections 8.2(j) or 8.3(d), as applicable, is set forth in this
Section 12.2. Except for the remedies contained in this Section 12.2 and
Section 11.2, and any other remedies available to the Parties at law or in
equity for breaches of provisions of this Agreement other than Articles 4, 5
and 6 (excluding Section 6.6), upon Closing, Sellers and Purchaser each
release, remise and forever discharge the other and their or its Affiliates
and all such Persons stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives from any and all suits, legal or administrative
proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest,
or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which
such Parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Sellers, Companys or Subsidiarys
ownership, use or operation of the Assets, or the condition, quality, status
or nature of the Assets, including rights to contribution under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended, breaches of statutory and implied warranties, nuisance or other
tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common law rights of contribution,
any rights under insurance policies issued or underwritten by the other Party
or Parties or any of its or their Affiliates and any rights under agreements
between the Companies or the Subsidiary and the Sellers or any other Affiliate
of the Companies, even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any released Person, or a pre-existing condition, but excluding, however, any
remaining balance owed by DEPI, DOTEPI, Reserves, any Company or any
Subsidiary to any other Affiliate at the end of the Closing Date for provision
of goods or services, or employment-related costs, or other ordinary course
of business expenses, with respect to the ownership or operation of the
Assets, the Companies or the Subsidiary. Without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, Purchaser agrees that from and after Closing its only
remedy with respect to any Sellers breach of its covenants and agreements in
Article 6 shall be the indemnity of DEPI in Section 12.2(b), as limited by the
terms of this Article 12. 

(d) " _Damages_ ," for purposes of this Article 12, shall mean the amount of
any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment incurred
or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the
indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property
damage, contract claims, torts or otherwise, including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts
reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or  



 

78  monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity;
provided, however, that "Damages" shall not include any adjustment for Taxes
that may be assessed on payments under this Article 12 or for Tax benefits
received by the Indemnified Person as a consequence of any Damages.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Sellers shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 12.2 for, and Damages shall not include,
(i) loss of profits, whether actual or consequential, or other consequential
damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification, or any punitive
damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages or punitive
damages suffered by third persons for which responsibility is allocated
between the Parties), (ii) any increase in liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment to the extent such increase is caused by the actions
or omissions of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date or (iii) except
with respect to claims for any Retained Seller Obligations or breach of
Sections 6.8, 6.9, 6.12 and 6.13, any liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment that does not individually exceed Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand dollars ($2,500,000).

(e) Any claim for indemnity under this Section 12.2 by any current or former
Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person
other than Sellers and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Sellers
or Purchaser under the terms of this Section 12.2 except as may be exercised
on its behalf by Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to this Section
12.2(e). Each of Sellers and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified
Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability
to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this
Section.

(f) Without prejudice to those Sections, this Section 12.2 shall not apply in
respect of title matters, which are exclusively covered by Article 3, Tax
matters other than Section 4.5, which are exclusively covered by Article 2 and
Article 9, or claims for Property Costs, which are covered exclusively by
Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 8.4. 

(g) (i) Purchaser may at its option notify DEPI in writing on or before ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of any matter disclosed by a
Phase I Investigation conducted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.1 which
Purchaser in good faith believes may constitute an Adverse Environmental
Condition (an " _Environmental Concern_ "). If the existence of such Adverse
Environmental Condition is suspected to exist in connection with the Phase I
Investigation but can only be determined through further investigation or
testing of soil, groundwater, or other materials or information (a
"Potential Adverse Environmental Condition"), Purchaser shall conduct a Phase
II environmental assessment with respect thereto within the timeframe provided
below and notify DEPI in writing in accordance with the procedure described
below of any item or information resulting from that Phase II environmental
assessment that the Purchaser believes in good faith constitutes an Adverse
Environmental Condition. Purchaser agrees that it is not permitted to conduct
a Phase II environmental assessment prior to Closing.

(ii) If Purchaser delivers timely notice of an Environmental Concern as
described above or of an alleged Adverse Environmental Condition confirmed
through a Phase II environmental assessment as described below and DEPI
confirms to its reasonable satisfaction that such Environmental Concern or
alleged Adverse  



 

79  Environmental Condition may constitute an Adverse Environmental Condition or
it is determined by the Environmental Arbitrator (defined below) that
such Environmental Concern or alleged Adverse Environmental Condition may
constitute an Adverse Environmental Condition (an "Agreed Environmental
Concern"), Seller shall provide indemnification pursuant to, and subject to
the limitations applicable to, Section 12.2(b)(vi) to the extent, and only to
the extent, of the Environmental Liabilities that arise from or relate
thereto.

(iii) Except for such disclosure to DEPI, Purchaser and DEPI shall maintain
the results of any environmental assessment and all findings in connection
therewith strictly confidential, subject to the terms of (including the
authorized disclosures pursuant to) the Confidentiality Agreement, as if each
Party were the "Recipient" and the other "DRI" thereunder. Each notice by
Purchaser under Section 12.2(g)(i) or Section 12.2(g)(iv) shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the Environmental Concern, including the
relevant excerpt from the Phase I Investigation or Phase II environmental
assessment, as appropriate.

(iv) With respect to any Potential Adverse Environmental Condition, Purchaser,
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date may conduct a Phase II
environmental assessment with respect thereto. Purchaser must notify Seller on
or before one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date of the
existence of any alleged Adverse Environmental Conditions, including a
copy of the relevant Phase II environmental assessment reports.

(v) If Purchaser and Seller do not agree on the existence of an Environmental
Concern or an Adverse Environmental Condition, the matter shall be submitted
to a nationally recognized independent environmental consulting firm mutually
acceptable to both the Purchaser and Seller (the "Environmental Arbitrator")
for review and final determination. The Environmental Arbitrator shall conduct
the arbitration proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on
all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining whether an Environmental
Concern or Adverse Environmental Condition exists, the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of Section 12.2(g) and the defined
terms contained in this Agreement. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as
an expert for the limited purpose of determining whether an Environmental
Concern or Adverse Environmental Condition exists and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. DEPI shall bear one half and Purchaser shall bear one half of the costs
and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator.

(vi) Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any
material remediation operations with respect to any claimed Damages relating
to a breach of DEPIs representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.6 or
any Claim relating to the subject matter of such representation or warranty or
any claim related to this Section  



 

80  12.2(g) without first giving Sellers notice of the remediation with
reasonable detail at least thirty (30) days prior thereto (or such shorter
period of time as shall be required by any Governmental Authority or required
to respond to any emergency situation). Sellers shall have the option (in
their sole discretion) to conduct (or have conducted on their behalf) such
remediation operations. If Sellers shall not have notified Purchaser of their
agreement to conduct such remediation operations within such specified period,
then Purchaser may conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) such operations.
Purchaser and Sellers agree that any remediation activities undertaken with
respect to the Assets, whether conducted by Purchaser or Sellers, for which
DEPI may have responsibility shall be reasonable in extent and cost effective
and shall be designed or implemented in such a manner as to achieve the least
stringent risk-based closure or remediation standard applicable to the
property in question under Environmental Laws, subject to the approval of any
Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such remediation activities,
and as necessary to permit the continued use of the affected property in the
same manner and for the same purposes for which it was being used at the
Closing Date. All remediation activities conducted by Sellers under this
Agreement shall be conducted to the extent reasonably possible so as not to
substantially interfere with Purchasers operation of the Assets.

(vii) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
Article 12 as an adjustment to the applicable Interest Purchase Price(s) in
the same manner as provided in Section 2.2(a).

Section 12.3 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
Section 12.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 12, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 12, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to
be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 12
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section
12.2(e)).

(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 12.2, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including
the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim
(the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is
based upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a "
_Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly
after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim;
provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim
as provided in this Section 12.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of
its obligations under Section 12.2 except to the extent such failure results
in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to
effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying
Persons ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.



 

81 (c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article 12\. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified
Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying
Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it
shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it
shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying
Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified
Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 12.3(d),
provided that the Indemnified Person may file initial pleadings as described
in the last sentence of paragraph (c) above if required by court or procedural
rules to do so within the thirty (30) day period in paragraph (c) above. An
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified
Persons liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a
settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from
all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the
Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person
shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to
(i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with respect to such
Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the
Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the
Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying
Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation
for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity with
respect to the Claim.



 

82 (f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder.

Section 12.4 _Casualty and Condemnation_.

(a) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty, Purchaser
shall nevertheless be required to close. In the event that the amount of the
costs and expenses associated with repairing or restoring the Assets affected
by such casualty and the Allocated Value, determined in the same manner as a
Title Defect in accordance with Section 3.5(g), for any Unit or Well taken
exceeds Twenty-five Million dollars ($25,000,000), Sellers must elect by
written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets
affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers sole cost,
as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date), (ii) to indemnify Purchaser through a document to be delivered at
Closing reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser against any costs or
expenses that Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets
subject to any casualty or (iii) to treat the costs and expenses associated
with repairing or restoring the Assets affected by such casualty or the
Allocated Value for any Unit or Well taken as a breach of DEPIs
representation under Section 3.1, but without regard to the limitations in
Section 3.5(g) (other than Section 3.5(g)(v)(B)). In each case, Sellers shall
retain (or, if applicable, receive an assignment from the Wholly-Owned Company
or the Subsidiary owning the affected properties of) all rights to insurance
and other claims against third Persons with respect to the casualty or taking
except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right
of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close;
provided, however, as its sole remedy for any expropriation, condemnation or
taking under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall be entitled to any
awards payable to Sellers, the Wholly-Owned Companies, or the Subsidiary
resulting from any such action up to the Allocated Value of the Asset; it
being understood and agreed that none of Sellers, the Companies or the
Subsidiary shall have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser with respect to
any such expropriation, condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain,

or before such termination date. The indemnities in Sections 12.2(a)(i),
12.2(a)(ii), 12.2(a)(v), 12.2(b)(iii) (to the extent related to Sections

for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds Twenty Five Million
dollars ($25,000,000), and then only to the extent such Damages exceed

indemnification for breach of those representations and warranties that
survive without time limit under the first sentence of Section 12.5(a), (ii)
indemnification for breach of those covenants contained in Sections 6.8, 6.9,

proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or
its Affiliates).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 9, Purchaser shall bear
any sales, use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods

recording fees and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon, or with

and accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, with copies of
such Records that pertain to (i) non-income Tax matters solely related to the
Wholly-Owned Companies, the Subsidiary or the Additional Assets; or (ii) if
such Records are necessary for Purchaser to adequately prepare Tax Returns or
to contest a Tax Audit pursuant to Article 9 with respect to any taxable
period falling partly in the Pre-Closing Period and partly in the Post-Closing
Period, with copies of such Records that are required by Purchaser for such
Tax Records or Tax Audit. Sellers may retain copies of any other Records.

(A) Sellers obligations under Article 9 (including to prepare Tax Returns and

(B) any claim for indemnification made under Section 12.2 of this Agreement
(excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications
with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser under this
Agreement)

for review and copying at Sellers expense and to the Wholly-Owned
Companies, the Subsidiary and their Affiliates personnel for the purpose of
discussing any such matter or claim.

Section 13.7 _Name Change_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make the
filings required in each Companys and Subsidiarys jurisdiction of
organization to eliminate the name "Dominion" and any variants thereof from

any case within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall (i) make all other filings (including assumed name filings)
required to reflect the change of name in all applicable records of
Governmental Authorities and (ii) eliminate the use of the name "Dominion"
and variants thereof from the Assets and the EandP Business, and, except with
respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have  



 

87  no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to any Seller
or any of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any
direct or indirect costs or expenses resulting from the change in use of
name, and any resulting notification or approval requirements.

Section 13.8 _Governing Law and Venue_. This Agreement and the legal relations
between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws
that would direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 13.9 _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Each Party consents to
personal jurisdiction in any action brought in any state or Federal court
located in the State of Delaware with respect to any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this
Agreement, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity, and each of the
Parties hereto agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with

Schedule pursuant to Section 2.2, the determination of a Title Defect Amount
or Title Benefit Amount pursuant to Section 3.5(i), the determination of
Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 8.4(b) or the determination of

to an expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted exclusively in
any Federal or state court in the State of Delaware and (solely in connection
with any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in relation to or in
connection with this Agreement) hereby: (a) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (b) waives any objection to laying

effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address
specified in Section 13.2. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service
of process shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware for any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement. Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby knowingly and
intentionally, irrevocably and unconditionally waives trial by jury in any
legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and for any
counterclaim therein.

Section 13.10 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for

obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to
whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent
to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.



 

88 Section 13.12 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or
any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party and any
transfer or delegation made without such consent shall be void; provided that
Purchaser may, without the consent of Sellers, (a) assign its rights and
duties under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any directly or
indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser that satisfies the
requirements of Section 5.11 and is designated in accordance with Section
8.2; but in no event shall such an assignment relieve Purchaser of its

their respective successors and assigns. In the event of any such assignment,
Purchaser shall execute and deliver the Guarantee provided for in Section
13.16.

Section 13.13 _Entire Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement, this
Agreement and the documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

Section 13.14 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by
an agreement in writing signed by Sellers and Purchaser and expressly
identified as an amendment or modification.
