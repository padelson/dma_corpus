Parent&#146;s application for the California Permit or in respect of any registration statement filed in
accordance with subsection (ii)(A) or (B)&nbsp;below. The Company and Parent will respond to any

their commercially reasonable efforts to have the California Permit granted as soon as practicable
after such filing. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the other such
information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, except with the consent of the

documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also
ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from
individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The
Parties each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as requested
by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.
