sheet of the Company Group as of the open of business on the Closing Date (the
" _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the calculation of the

from the Closing Balance Sheet, the amount of accrued and unpaid income Taxes
of the Acquired Subsidiaries, Nelco SG and Neltec SA, in each case, for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods other than (1) US federal income Tax , (2) state income
Tax of the Acquired Subsidiaries attributable to any such Acquired Subsidiary
being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group with

Neltec SA being a member of a consolidated group with ParkNelco (the "
_Closing Tax Amount_ ") and any unpaid Transaction Expenses, which shall
present the Cash Amount, Closing Tax Amount, and the Indebtedness Amount, in
the aggregate and separately for the Acquired Subsidiaries and each of Nelco
SG and Neltec SA (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Preliminary
Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared and the Net Working
Capital Amount shall be determined (the following referred to herein as the "
_Accounting Principles_ ") on a consolidated basis in accordance with Parent's
past practices to the extent compliant with GAAP, and, to the extent not
compliant with GAAP, in accordance with and compliant with GAAP. The parties
acknowledge that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and
determining the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Closing Tax Amount, and Net
Working Capital Amount and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated
by this _Section 2.5_ is to (i) measure the Cash Amount, Closing Tax Amount,
Indebtedness Amount and (ii) measure changes in the Net Working Capital Amount
against the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining the Cash Amount, Closing Tax Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Net Working Capital Amount. Buyer shall provide Parent and its accountants and
other representatives reasonable access to review Buyer's books and records
and any work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement
and the adjustments contemplated thereby. Parent and its accountants and other
representatives may make inquiries of Buyer and their respective accountants
regarding questions or disagreements, and Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. At the request of Parent, Buyer shall make available its personnel
and accountants to advise and assist Parent in its review of the Preliminary
Statement and any objections or disputes with respect thereto.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) If Parent has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, Parent
shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "
_Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
Buyer within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement
to Parent, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. Parent and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, Parent and Buyer shall submit such dispute to BDO USA, LLP, if BDO
USA, LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and Parent shall appoint by mutual
agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants other than Parent's accountants or Buyer's
accountants (the " _Valuation Firm_ "), to resolve the items that remain in
dispute. Any further submissions to the Valuation Firm must be written and
delivered to Parent and Buyer. The Valuation Firm shall make a final
determination of the Cash Amount, Closing Tax Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Net
Working Capital Amount, and the resulting Aggregate Final Consideration
calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such amounts are in
dispute, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including, the
Accounting Principles), without regard to principles of equity. The Valuation
Firm shall apply the provision of this Section 2.5 solely to the items in
dispute, and shall have no authority or power to alter, modify or amend, add
to or subtract from any term or provision of this Agreement. None of Buyer,
Parent nor any of their respective representatives or Affiliates shall have
any ex parte communications or meetings with the Valuation Firm regarding the
subject matter hereof without the other Party's prior written consent. The
Valuation Firm shall not assign a value to any disputed item greater than the
greatest value or smaller than the smallest value assigned to such item by
Buyer, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand. Buyer and Parent shall
request the Valuation Firm to render its decision in writing as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after its
engagement). The parties shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the
term of its engagement, including by executing a customary engagement letter.
The determination by the Valuation Firm of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness
Amount, Closing Tax Amount, Net Working Capital Amount and the resulting
Aggregate Final Consideration calculated with reference thereto, shall become
final and binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its
final resolution in writing to the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Valuation Firm shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to such Party bears to the amount contested as determined
by the Valuation Firm. The Valuation Firm shall act as an expert, not an
arbitrator.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 2.6 ** _ **Post-Closing Adjustment Payment.**_

  



  

(a) If the Aggregate Final Consideration is greater than the Aggregate
Estimated Consideration, Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days) pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the amount of such
excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent to Buyer.

  



  

(b) If the Aggregate Final Consideration is less than the Aggregate
Estimated Consideration, Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days) pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer the amount of such

designated by in writing by Buyer to Parent.

  



  

(c) The Transaction Expenses stated in the Preliminary Statement shall be
paid by Parent to the relevant member of the Company Group, for payment to the
persons to which such amounts are owed, at the same time as the payment under
_Section 2.6(a)_ or _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be made.

  



  

(i) If the Transaction Expenses set forth in the Preliminary Statement are
greater than as set forth in the Closing Statement, the excess shall be paid
by Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) as
may be specified in the Preliminary Statement, and

  



  

(ii) if the Transaction Expenses set forth in the Preliminary Statement
are less than as set forth in the Closing Statement, the excess shall be paid
by Buyer or the relevant parties that received the payment of Transaction
Expenses made by Parent in accordance with Section 2.3 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent to Buyer. The payments hereunder shall be made at the same time as
the payment under Section 2.6(a) or (b).

  



  

 **Article III** 
  
  _ **Representations and Warranties of Parent**_

  



  

Parent represents and warrants to Buyer that as of the date of this Agreement
(unless the particular statement speaks expressly as of another date, in which
case Parent represents and warrants to Buyer as of such other date), except as
disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered to Buyer simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "):

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 3.1 ** _ **Organization, Standing and Corporate Power**_.
Parent and each member of the Company Group is an entity validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of such Person's jurisdiction of formation and
has all requisite entity power and authority necessary to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it is now being
conducted. Parent and each member of the Company Group is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a
Company Group Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

 **Section 3.2 ** _ **Authority; Noncontravention.**_

  



  

(a) Parent has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of and performance by Parent under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, and the consummation of the Transactions, have been
duly authorized and approved by the board of directors of Parent, to the
extent required by Law, and no other corporate action on the part of Parent is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of and performance by Parent
under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents and the consummation by it
of the Transactions. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents have
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by Buyer, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(b)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents by Parent, nor the
consummation by Parent of the Transactions, nor compliance by Parent with any
of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) materially conflict with or
materially violate any provision of Parent Organizational Documents or Company
Group Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming that each of the consents,
authorizations and approvals referred to in _Section 3.3_ are obtained (and
any condition precedent to any such consent, authorization or approval has
been satisfied) and each of the filings referred to in _Section 3.3_ are made

otherwise liable, could be expected to require any payment or transfer of
money, property or other consideration on account of or in connection with the
Transactions or any subsequent termination of employment or services which
could constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code. The Company Group is not under any obligation to gross-up

Material at any real property currently owned, operated or leased any member
of the Company Group or any real property formerly owned, leased or operated

Company Group was owned by Parent), in a manner that has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to Liabilities for response costs,
corrective action costs, personal injury, property damage, natural resources

for inventory and obsolete personal property disposed of by Parent or a member
of the Company Group in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

businesses as the same are being conducted at the date of this Agreement.

each of the leases described on _Schedule 3.13(c)_ , and none of such leases
have been modified in any material respect, except to the extent that such
modifications are disclosed by the copies made available to Buyer. Neither
Parent nor any member of the Company Group is in default in any material
respect under any of such leases, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no other
party to any of the leases set forth on _Schedule 3.13(c)_ has a right to
terminate, accelerate performance under or otherwise modify any of the leases.

any easements appurtenant thereto, comprise all material real property used by
any member of the Company Group in the conduct of the Business. The use and
operation of the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property in the
conduct of the Business do not violate in any material respect any Law,
covenant, condition, restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement,
including any agreement executed with a Governmental Authority in relation to
the use of such property, except for such violation which does not and would
not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company
Group. No material improvements constituting a part of the Owned Real Property
or Leased Real Property encroaches on real property owned or leased by a
Person other than a member of the Company Group, except for such violation
which does not and would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the Company Group. There are no suits or proceedings pending nor,
to Parent's Knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Owned Real
Property, Leased Real Property, or any portion thereof or interest therein in
the nature or in lieu of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.

any member of the Company Group has received any notice from any insurance
carrier of, nor is it aware of, any defects or inadequacies in the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property that, if not corrected, would result in
termination of insurance coverage, increase its cost or otherwise affect the
insurability of the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property. To Parent's

Property or Leased Real Property within the last five years. To Parent's

action after the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to materially

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party

other in relation to) any proposed written communication to a Governmental
Authority, (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any developments,
meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any

discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. However, (i) each of Buyer and Parent
may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to " _Outside Administrative Counsel_ " only and any
such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or
their equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing
the non-public information and (ii) materials may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Parent or Company Group, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer shall,
and cause its Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best efforts and
take any and all steps reasonably necessary to obtain all clearances,

general, or any other Governmental Authority, and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the Transactions under any antitrust law and advise the other
party promptly of any material communication received by such party or any of
its Affiliates from the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general, or any other
Governmental Authority regarding any of the Transactions, and of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) such party
proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, DOJ, any state attorney general,
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of any
party will not require such party or its Affiliates to (i) sell or divest any

any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, (iii) commence any

otherwise) to any third party or to otherwise suffer any detriment, to obtain
any consent required for the consummation of the Transactions, to waive or
forego any right, remedy or condition hereunder; _provided_ that such party
will be permitted to grant accommodations or concessions regarding any of the
foregoing in its sole discretion so long as such accommodations or concessions
are paid prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of Parent, included as
Transaction Expenses in the Closing Statement.

  



  

 **Section 5.4 ** _ **CFIUS.**_

  



  

(a) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to jointly prepare
all information necessary to complete for Buyer to submit or cause to be
submitted to CFIUS: (i) promptly as practicable after the date hereof, a draft
of the CFIUS Notice; and (ii) promptly after responding to any comments
(either written or oral) from the CFIUS staff on the draft of the CFIUS Notice
(or as soon as possible after CFIUS staff confirms it has no comments to the
draft of the CFIUS Notice), a formal CFIUS Notice. Buyer and Parent shall each
promptly provide all necessary information within their respective control to
allow Buyer to complete the draft and formal versions of the CFIUS Notice.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Buyer shall take the lead in the drafting of the CFIUS Notice;
provided that no version of the CFIUS Notice shall be submitted to CFIUS
without the mutual written consent of the Parent and Buyer communicated
through their respective counsel. Following submission of the CFIUS Notice,
each of the Parent and Buyer shall cooperate (to the extent permitted by Laws)
and provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information requested by
CFIUS regarding such party during the CFIUS review process as promptly as
practicable, and in all cases within the amount of time allowed by CFIUS. No
party shall communicate with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such
filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
sufficient prior notice of such communication and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed written communication (subject to the terms of _Section 5.3(c)_ )
and, with respect to any oral communication, to attend and/or participate in
such conversation or meeting. Each of Buyer and Parent may designate any non-
public information provided to CFIUS as restricted or make any redactions
consistent with _Section 5.3(c)_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Buyer shall have no obligation to share with the Parent any
personal identifier information, as such term is defined under 31 C.F.R. §
800.402.

  



  

(c) The Buyer and Parent, in cooperation with each other, shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval, and without limiting the
foregoing, the parties shall consider and take all such commercially
reasonable actions and agree to such commercially reasonable requirements or
conditions to mitigate any national security concerns as may be requested or
required by CFIUS in connection with, or as a condition of, the CFIUS
Approval; provided, however, that no party shall be obligated to propose or
accept any mitigation or compromise to secure CFIUS Approval that would
materially adversely impact the value of this Agreement to the party or would
restrict the Buyer's business after closing this Agreement. In the event that
CFIUS informs the parties that it has a national security concern that cannot
be resolved with the period of the 30-day review or the 45-day investigation
period, Buyer shall have the option, with the consent of CFIUS, to withdraw
the notice and abandon the transaction (in which case there will be no CFIUS
Approval) or to withdraw the notice and refile the CFIUS Notice **.**

  



  

 **Section 5.5 ** _ **Public Announcements**_. Buyer, Parent and each of
their respective Representatives shall consult with Buyer and Parent before
issuing, and give Buyer and Parent the opportunity to review, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system (and then only after commercially reasonable advance notice
and consultation); _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.5_ shall not
preclude communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions
of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.6 ** _ **Access to Information; Contact with Employees;
Customers and Suppliers.**_

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent shall afford
to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to Parent's and each member of the Company Group's properties, books,
Contracts and records concerning the Business, and Parent shall furnish
promptly to Buyer such information concerning the Business as Buyer may
reasonably request; _provided_ that Buyer and its Representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of Parent or any member of the Company Group;
_provided_ _further_ that neither Parent nor any member of the Company Group
shall be obligated to provide such access or information if Parent determines,
in its sole reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or
a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, jeopardize
the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose such party to risk
of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_
_further_ that such access shall not extend to any sampling or analysis of
soil, groundwater, building materials or other environmental media of the sort
generally referred to as a Phase II environmental investigation unless Parent
agrees to provide such access to Buyer in writing, which consent to access
shall not be unreasonably withheld by Parent (it being understood an agreement
as to the scope of such environmental investigation will be a condition to
Parent's consent). Until the Closing, the information provided shall be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause its
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall
be submitted or directed exclusively to Benjamin Shore or such other
individuals as Parent may designate in writing from time to time.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its respective Representatives may
only contact and communicate with the employees, agents, customers, payors,
Representatives, service providers, regulators, suppliers and other material
business relations of Parent and/or members of the Company Group related to
the Transactions after prior consultation with, and written approval of,
Parent.

  



  

 **Section 5.7 ** _ **Access to Books and Records.**_

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
from and after the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the members of the Company Group to, provide Parent and its
authorized Representatives with access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to (i) the books and records (for the purpose of examining
and copying) of any member of the Company Group concerning the Business with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date and (ii)
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates for purposes of better understanding
such books and records. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Parent,
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any member of the Company Group to, for
a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of Parent or any member of
the Company Group for any period prior to the Closing Date without first
giving reasonable prior written notice to Parent and offering to surrender to
Parent such books and records or any portion thereof that Buyer or such member
of the Company Group may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

  



  

(b) Parent may, upon providing Buyer with notice specifying the materials
to be retained, retain copies of any Contracts, documents or records of any
member of the Company Group: (i) for archival purposes, (ii) which relate to
properties or activities of Parent, (iii) which are required to be retained
pursuant to any applicable Law or are subject to the attorney-client
privilege, or (iv) for financial reporting purposes, for Tax purposes or for
legal defense or prosecution purposes.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 5.8 ** _ **Indemnification and Insurance; Releases**_ **.**

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each member
of the Company Group to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
and former director, manager or officer of Parent or any member of the Company
Group, as applicable, and each person who served as a director, manager,
officer, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of Parent or any member of the
Company Group (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
(whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a " _D andO
Claim_"), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
any action or omission relating to their position with Parent or any member of
the Company Group occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the
Closing (including any DandO Claim relating in whole or in part to this
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of Parent and each member of
the Company Group to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in (A)
Parent Organizational Documents or the respective organizational documents of
each member of the Company Group as in effect on the date hereof and (B) any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee, which shall in each case
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Closing,
each member of the Company Group shall, and Buyer shall cause each member of
the Company Group to, cause the organizational documents of such member of the
Company Group to include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors
and officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnitees no less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the
organizational documents of such member of the Company Group as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the each
member of the Company Group to, pay and advance to each Indemnitee any
expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any DandO Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 5.8_ or the enforcement of an Indemnitee's rights under this _Section
5.8_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses (but only to the extent required by
applicable Law, Parent Organizational Documents, applicable organization
documents of any member of the Company Group or applicable indemnification
agreements as in effect on the date hereof). Any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an Indemnitee's conduct complies with an
applicable standard under applicable Law, Parent Organizational Documents,
applicable organizational documents of a member of the Company Group or
applicable indemnification agreements, as the case may be and as in effect on
the date hereof, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume
and control the defense of any DandO Claim relating to any acts or omissions
covered under this _Section 5.8_ with counsel selected by the Indemnitee,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_
, that Buyer (i) shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such DandO
Claim at its own expense and (ii) shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without Buyer's written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement includes
an unconditional release of Buyer from any liabilities arising out of such DandO
Claim. Buyer shall cooperate with the Indemnitees in the defense of any DandO
Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by an Indemnitee in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 5.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Buyer shall not (and Buyer
shall cause each member of the Company Group not to) settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any DandO Claim, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the Indemnitees
covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. Nothing in this _Section 5.8(c)_ shall relieve Buyer or Parent
of their obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Buyer
under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.8_
applies unless (A) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_ ).

  



  

(e) In the event that Buyer or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the
obligations of Buyer set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to members', managers', directors'
and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to Parent, any member of the Company Group or any of
their respective managers, directors or officers.

  



  

 **Section 5.9 ** _ **No Control of Other Party 's Business**_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct Parent's or any member of the Company Group's
operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and each member of the Company Group's respective
operations.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 5.10 ** _ **Updates**_. From the date hereof until the
Closing, if Parent becomes aware of any variances from the representations and
warranties contained in _ARTICLE III_ , Parent shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the delivery
of any such updated Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such variance or inaccuracy and shall not affect the
rights of Buyer to make any claim (whether for indemnification or otherwise)
against Parent for any such variance or inaccuracy.

  



  

 **Section 5.11 ** _ **Transferred Employees**_ _._ On the Closing Date
and after giving effect to the Reorganization Transactions, (a) Parent, PAPD
and Park Sales shall each terminate its respective employment relationship
with, and (b) Neltec shall enter into a new Contract or offer a new Contract,
on terms (including material terms as to employment, confidentiality and
protective covenants) acceptable to Buyer, with, in each case, the employees
identified on Schedule 3.16(a) (the "Transferred Employees"), and Parent, PAPD
and Park Sales shall retain and assume all liabilities arising prior to the
Closing under any applicable employment Contracts, each as set forth on
Schedule 10.13-5, relating to the pre-Closing employment relationship between
Parent, Park Sales and/or PAPD and each Transferred Employee. Subject to
Section 5.8, in connection with such employment transfers, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to identify key employees and assist Buyer
with arranging interviews with those employees to determine appropriate post-
Closing retention plans and compensation.

  



  

 **Section 5.12 ** _ **Employee Matters**_. During the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide the U.S. employees of each member of the Company Group and
the Transferred Employees (collectively, the "Applicable Employees") with
compensation, excluding compensation under equity-based plans of Parent and
its Affiliates, that is no less favorable in any material respect than the
compensation provided to such Applicable Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and with employee benefits that are at least substantially
similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Applicable
Employees under the applicable Company Group Plans and Parent Benefit Plans.
Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and
shall cause each member of the Company Group to, grant all of the Transferred
Employees credit for any service with Parent or any member of the Company
Group earned prior to the Closing Date (a) for eligibility and vesting
purposes and (b) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit
determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or maintained by Buyer or any member of
the Company Group on or after the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall (c)
cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work
requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence
of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or
satisfied by an Applicable Employee under any Company Group Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (d) cause any deductible, co-insurance
and out-of-pocket covered expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any
Applicable Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in
the year of initial participation. Parent and Parent's Affiliates (other than
the members of the Company Group) shall be solely responsible for satisfying
the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all
individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.12, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Applicable Employee any right to
continued employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific
employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any New Plan or Company Group Plan. Nothing in this Section
5.12 shall be deemed to limit the right of Buyer, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Applicable Employee
at any time.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 5.13 ** _ **Additional Employee Information**_. Not later than
two (2) weeks following the execution hereof, Parent will provide Buyer with a
complete and accurate list of each Applicable Employee providing services for
the benefit of the Business, his or her employer, dates of hire, work
location, position, title, and salary grade (if any), FLSA classification (if
applicable), current base salary or wage rate, and commissions, bonus or other
material compensation paid in each of the last three (3) years.

  



  

 **Section 5.14 ** _ **Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation**_ **.**

  



  

(a) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates which it Controls to, (i) engage in or assist others in engaging in
the Restricted Business; (ii) have an interest in any Person that engages in
the Restricted Business, including as a partner, shareholder, member,
employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or (iii) intentionally
interfere in any material respect with the business relationships (whether
formed prior to or after the date of this Agreement) between the Company Group
and customers or suppliers of the Company Group as such business relationships
relate to the Restricted Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person
traded on any national securities exchange if Parent is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person.

  



  

(b) During the Restricted Period, Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates to, hire or solicit any employee of the Company Group as
of the Closing Date or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or
hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
provided, that nothing in this _Section 5.14(b)_ shall prevent Parent or any
of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the Company Group or Buyer or (ii) after 180 days from the date
of termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been
terminated by the employee.

  



  

(c) During the Restricted Period, Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates which it Controls to, directly or indirectly solicit or
entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the
Company Group or potential clients or customers of the Company Group for
purposes of diverting their business or services from the Company Group.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be
precluded from soliciting, enticing, or attempting to solicit or entice (i)
any client, customer or supplier of the Retained Business with respect to the
business products and services of such businesses or (ii) any other client,
customer or supplier of the Company Group with respect to any line of business
other than the Restricted Business.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the restrictions contained
in this _Section 5.14_ will not prohibit, in any way: (i) the acquisition of a
controlling interest or merger with any Person, or a division or business unit
thereof (and the continued ownership and operation thereof by Parent or its
Affiliates), which does not derive more than 40% of its gross revenue from the
Restricted Business; or (ii) the conduct of any Retained Business or any line
of business other than the Restricted Business. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall restrict any business or activity related
to the aerospace operations conducted by Parent or any of its Affiliates,
joint ventures, Subsidiaries or divisions as of the Closing Date and any
natural extensions thereof.

  



  

(e) Parent acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
_Section 5.14_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in
the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Parent of any such
obligations, Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies
that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

  



  

(f) Parent acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
5.14_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 5.14_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this _Section 5.14_ and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.14_ , nothing
herein shall restrict Parent from selling any equipment or facilities located
at its facilities in Fullerton, CA or Newburgh, NY (and not otherwise included
in this Agreement) to any Person, including to any Person who is a competitor
of any member of the Company Group.

  



  

 **Section 5.15 ** _ **No Solicitation of Other Bids**_ **.**

  



  

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) or any of its or their Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. Parent shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Company) and all of its and their
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation, liquidation,
recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination transaction
involving the Company; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of the Company; or (iii) the sale, lease,
exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of the Company's
properties or assets.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 5.15_ ,
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after
receipt thereof by Parent or its Representatives) advise Buyer orally and in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making the same.

  



  

(c) Parent agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 5.15_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

  



  

 **Section 5.16 ** _ **Liquidation of Nelco PRC**_.

  



  

(a) Prior to Closing, Parent shall and shall cause Nelco SG to use
reasonable best efforts to dissolve and liquidate Nelco PRC as quickly and
diligently as possible.

  



  

(b) Within forty-five (45) days of the date hereof, Parent and Buyer shall
use their best efforts to enter into a supplemental agreement (the " _PRC Side
Letter_ ") that shall provide that Parent shall, at Parent's sole cost and
expense, dissolve and liquidate Nelco PRC in accordance with applicable Laws
and set forth such other details concerning the dissolution and liquidation
process as the parties may agree if Nelco PRC shall not have been fully and
completely dissolved and liquidated in accordance with applicable Laws by the
Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Parent shall timely and fully provide Buyer with such information and
reports as requested by Buyer regarding Nelco PRC and its dissolution and
liquidation.

  



  

(d) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, at Parent's expense, in
connection with the dissolution and liquidation of Nelco PRC.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller agree that the value of the Nelco PRC Equity is $0 and the tax and
accounting attributes of Nelco PRC will not be used for any purposes in
connection with the provisions of _ARTICLE II_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 5.17 ** _ **Transition Services**_.

  



  

Prior to Closing, the parties agree to act in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to enter into a commercially reasonable transition
services agreement (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ ") pursuant to
which:

  



  

(a) Parent and its Affiliates will provide to Buyer and the Company Group
certain services customarily provided in a transition services agreement which
Parent or its Affiliates currently provide to the Company Group for such
reasonable periods of time as may be reasonably necessary for Buyer to
transition the Company Group to another provider of such services.

  



  

(b) Buyer and the Company Group will provide to Parent and its Affiliates
certain services which are currently available from the Company Group to
assist the Parent and its Affiliates with, among other things, (i) the wind

and the PRC Side Letter), (ii) periodically inspecting and addressing issues

support relating to the transition of the Retained Business' research and
development activities out of the Company Group's Arizona facility; and (iv)
certain limited transitional support of the Company Group's information
technology personnel in connection with the replacement of their roles within
the Retained Business.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties will not be required to
expose confidential information to the other parties, devote resources to the
material detriment of its business or violate any Applicable Laws in the
provision of transition services.

  



  

(d) The transition services agreement will generally provide that services
will be provided by the parties in exchange for compensation intended to do no
more than reimburse the parties for the reasonable costs of providing the
services.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be

5.3_.

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this

days following receipt of written notice from Parent stating Parent's
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ and
the basis for such termination; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if it is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement hereunder; _provided_ _further_ that neither a breach by Buyer of
_Section 4.5_ nor the failure to deliver the Aggregate Estimated Consideration
and the other Closing payments pursuant to _ARTICLE II_ , to be made at or
before the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject to cure hereunder
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent.

  



  

 **Section 7.2 ** _ **Effect of Termination**_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party, specifying the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void (other than this Section 7.2 and Article X (other than
Section 10.8), all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and
there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer, Parent any member of the
Company Group or their respective directors, managers, officers, employees or
Affiliates hereunder; provided, however, that no party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any willful breach of
this Agreement by such party or failure by such party to consummate the
Transactions to occur under this Agreement at the Closing in circumstances in
which all of the conditions to Closing for the benefit of such party set forth
in Article VI have been satisfied or waived; and provided further, however,
that should Buyer elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)
as a result of the institution or overt threat of institution of a suit or
proceeding against Parent or any member of the Company Group by any one or
more stockholders of Parent seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, or prohibit
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall, upon written demand of Buyer,
reimburse Buyer for all of its reasonably-documented out of pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, including without limitation the
fees and expenses of its counsel and its accounting, tax, and other advisors
and consultants. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Article VIII** 
  
  _ **INDEMNIFICATION**_

  



  

 **Section 8.1 ** _ **Survival**_. The Standard Representations of (a)
Parent and (b) Buyer (and Buyer's and Parent's right to seek a claim for
indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ in respect thereof) shall survive
the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the " _General Survival End
Date_ "). The Fundamental Representations of (a) Parent and (b) Buyer (and
Buyer's and Parent's right to seek a claim for indemnification under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ in respect thereof) and Buyer's right to seek a claim for
indemnification with respect to the Fullerton Liabilities, the Nelco PRC
Liabilities or breach of Parent's obligations set forth in _Section 5.16_
shall survive the Closing indefinitely (the " _Fundamental Survival Period_
"). The Compliance Representations of Parent (and Buyer's right to seek a
claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ in respect thereof) and
Buyer's right to seek a claim for indemnification under _Section 8.3(a)(i)(3)_
for Indemnified Taxes or breach of Parent's obligations set forth in _ARTICLE
IX_ (the " _Tax Indemnification_ ") shall survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect until the sixtieth (60th) day following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations period associated with such
liabilities in question (the " _Compliance Representation Survival End Date_
"). The representations of Parent set forth in _Section 3.11_ , above (and
Buyer's right to seek a claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ in
respect thereof), shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect until the date that is six (6) years following the Closing Date (the "
_Environmental Representation Survival End Date_ ") and the representations of
Parent set forth in _Section 3.12_ , above (and Buyer's right to seek a claim
for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ in respect thereof), shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until the date that
is three (3) years following the Closing Date (the " _IP Representation
Survival End Date_ "). The covenants and agreements of the parties contained
in this Agreement that are required to be performed (a) prior to the Closing
shall survive until the Closing and terminate at the Closing, and (b) after
the Closing shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the representations, warranties
and covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement that
are required to be performed prior to the Closing shall not survive beyond the
Closing and there shall be no liability in respect thereof, whether such
liability has accrued prior to or after the Closing, on the part of any party,
its Affiliates or any of their respective partners, officers, directors,
managers or agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any good faith written
claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VIII_ in respect of any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is made with reasonable
specificity prior to the General Survival End Date, the Fundamental Survival
End Date, the Compliance Representation Survival End Date, the Environmental
Representation Survival End Date or the IP Representation Survival End Date,
as applicable, shall survive until such claim is finally resolved pursuant to
_Section 8.5_.

  



  

 **Section 8.2 ** _ **Exclusive Remedy**_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, from and after the Closing, the rights provided in
this _ARTICLE VIII_ (but subject to the limitations set forth herein and for
the avoidance of doubt excluding the remedies available under _Section 10.8_ )
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer Indemnified Persons
with respect to any Damages suffered or incurred in connection with or arising
from any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or
failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any
covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement or the IP
Assignment Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer, on behalf of
itself and each Buyer Indemnified Person, hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against Parent or any of its equityholders or any of their respective
Affiliates arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 8.3 ** _ **Indemnification.**_

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Parent_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ , from and
after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_
") shall be indemnified by Parent from and against any and all actual out-of-
pocket losses, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses, but excluding all expenses and costs incurred in connection with
making claims under and disputes regarding this Agreement), settlement
payments, awards, judgments, fines or obligations (collectively, " _Damages_
") incurred or suffered by Buyer Indemnified Persons and resulting from (1)
any breach or inaccuracy of any Parent Representation, (2) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement, (3) Indemnified
Taxes or breach of Parent's obligations under _Article IX_ that result in
Damages other than Indemnified Taxes, (4) the Parent Benefit Plans, (5) the
Fullerton Liabilities, (6) any Nelco PRC Liabilities or breach of Parent's
obligations set forth in _Section 5.16_ , (7) any Transaction Expenses or
Indebtedness of the Company Group outstanding as of the Closing to the extent
not paid or satisfied, or caused to be paid or satisfied, by Parent at or
prior to the Closing, or if paid by Buyer at or prior to the Closing, to the
extent not deducted in the determination of the Aggregate Final Consideration
or (8) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent contained in the IP
Assignment Agreement.

  



  

(ii) From and after the Closing, subject to any applicable time period
limitations set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.4_ , Buyer Indemnified
Persons shall have the right to seek indemnification for Damages from Parent
in respect of the indemnification provisions of _Section 8.3(a)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Section 8.4_.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, but subject in each case to _Section 8.2_ , even if a Buyer
Indemnified Person would otherwise be entitled to recover Damages pursuant to
this _ARTICLE VIII_ , Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 8.3_ _(a)_ _(i)_ _(1)_ for: (A) any individual
Damages or series of related Damages (other than the Fullerton Liabilities,
Nelco PRC Liabilities, Damages that relate to the Tax Indemnification or those
arising out of breaches of the Fundamental Representations, the Compliance
Representations or from fraud) arising out of substantially similar or related
facts and circumstances unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
Damages exceeds $25,000 (the " _Threshold Basket_ ") in which case Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other terms and provisions of this
_Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ (including the Basket), be entitled to indemnification
for the full amount of such Damages; (B) any Damages unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds 1% of the Base Consideration (the
" _Basket_ ") (other than with respect to the Fullerton Liabilities, Nelco PRC
Liabilities, the Tax Indemnification, Fundamental Representations, Compliance
Representations or fraud), _provided_ that only Damages satisfying the
Threshold Basket count toward satisfying the Basket, in which case Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent
the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds the Basket and (C) Damages in
an aggregate amount exceeding 10% of the Base Consideration (the " _Cap_ ")
(other than with respect to the Fullerton Liabilities, Nelco PRC Liabilities,
the Tax Indemnification, Fundamental Representations, Compliance
Representations or fraud). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (x) no Damages may be claimed hereunder by any
Buyer Indemnified Person to the extent that such Damages have been taken into
account in the determination of the Aggregate Final Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)_ , and (y) in no event shall Parent be responsible toward any
Buyer Indemnified Person for any Damages (including any Damages with respect
to Fundamental Representations or Compliance Representations) in excess of the
Aggregate Final Consideration.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this _ARTICLE VIII_ and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 8.4_ , from and after the Closing, Parent and its officers,
directors, managers, equityholders, agents, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, assigns,
heirs, successors and predecessors (the " _Parent Indemnified Persons_ " and
together with the Buyer Indemnified Persons, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
shall be indemnified by Buyer, from and against any and all Damages incurred
or suffered by Parent Indemnified Persons and resulting from (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation and warranty of Buyer contained in _Article
IV_ , (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing, (iii) any
breach by Buyer or any member of the Company Group of any of their covenants
or agreements contained herein which are to be performed by such Person after
the Closing, or (iv) breach of Buyer's obligations under _Article IX_ that
result in Damages.

  



  

(c) _Materiality for Determination of Damages_. For purposes of this
_ARTICLE VIII_ , any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Company Group Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty solely for purposes of
determining the amount of Damages incurred. By way of clarification, all
references to materiality or Company Group Material Adverse Effect shall be
included in the representations or warranties as written in this Agreement for
purposes of determining whether a breach of such representation or warranty
occurred in the first instance.

  



  

 **Section 8.4 ** _ **Indemnification Procedures.**_

  



  

(a) Any Indemnified Person seeking indemnification or reimbursement
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall promptly provide to (i) Parent, in the
case of indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ , or (ii) Buyer, in the
case of indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ (in each case, as
applicable, the " _Indemnifying Person_ "), in each case, a written notice of
any good faith claims that it may have pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ (a "
_Claim Notice_ "), and in the event that there be asserted against any
Indemnified Person any written claim or demand by a third-party for which such
Indemnified Person may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_ARTICLE VIII_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall
provide to the Indemnifying Person a Claim Notice with respect thereto as
promptly as practicable following such Indemnified Person's receipt of such
claim (and no fewer than twenty (20) calendar days prior to a scheduled
appearance date in a litigated matter). Each Claim Notice shall contain the
amount or a good faith estimate of the potential Damages (the " _Damage
Estimate_ ") against which such Indemnified Person seeks indemnification, to
the extent then ascertainable, and a statement that such Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ with respect to
such Damage Estimate and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any failure by such Indemnified Person to give
such notice promptly shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any
indemnification obligations hereunder unless and only to the extent the
Indemnifying Person is prejudiced by such failure, or unless the Claim Notice
is not given prior to the General Survival End Date, the Fundamental Survival
End Date, the IP Representation Survival End Date, Environmental
Representation Survival Date or the Compliance Representation Survival End
Date, as applicable.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) With respect to each Third-Party Claim that is the subject of a Claim
Notice, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.4(c)_ ,
to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim, at its own
expense, with counsel approved by such Indemnified Person (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) by notice to such
Indemnified Person delivered within twenty (20) calendar days after the
receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim (or such lesser number of days set
forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event
of a litigated matter) (the " _Response Period_ "); provided, that if the
Indemnifying Person is Parent, such Indemnifying Person shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x)
is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or
customer of the Company, or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to
have irrevocably waived its right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim
if it does not give notice of its desire to so defend on or prior to
expiration of the Response Period, _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
respond within the Response Period shall not waive or in any way limit any of
the Indemnifying Person's or other Indemnifying Person's rights to object to
such Indemnified Person's rights to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_ for such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Person notifies such Indemnified
Person within the Response Period that it desires to defend against a Third-
Party Claim, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and employ separate counsel of
its choosing. Such Indemnified Person shall participate in any such defense at
its own expense unless (i) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Person; or (ii) the Indemnifying Person or any of the other
Indemnifying Persons, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Person, on the
other hand, are each named parties to the proceedings and, in the reasonable
opinion of outside counsel to such Indemnified Person, a conflict or potential
conflict (other than by virtue of delivery of a Claim Notice) exists between
the Indemnifying Person and/or any of the Indemnifying Persons, on the one
hand, and such Indemnified Person, on the other hand, that would make such
separate representation advisable, in either case, the reasonable attorneys'
fees, disbursements and expenses of such separate representation shall be
eligible to be indemnifiable Damages; _provided_ , _however_ , all Buyer
Indemnified Persons or Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to
reimbursement for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) in connection with any Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person may
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim that
it has elected to assume the defense of but shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in or
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would materially restrict the future activity
or conduct of the applicable Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
any material non-monetary condition or obligation being imposed on any
applicable Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates or (iii) any material
adverse effect on the business of the applicable Indemnified Person or any of
its Affiliates.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.4_ to the contrary, an
Indemnified Person shall have the obligation to assume and control the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Person and shall consult with the Indemnifying Person regarding
the strategy for defense of such claim, if the Indemnifying Person expressly
elects not to defend such Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim or
has not duly assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim as provided in
_Section 8.4(b)_. In the event an Indemnifying Person has elected not to
control the defense of an applicable Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying
Person shall have no liability with respect to a Third-Party Claim settled or
compromised without such Indemnifying Person's consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Indemnified Person
and the Indemnifying Person shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by providing access to each
other's relevant business records and other documents and employees. The
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall keep each other
reasonably informed with respect to the status of such Third-Party Claim as
either may request from time to time.

  



  

 **Section 8.5 ** _ **Final Resolution**_. A Claim Notice, any amounts
claimed therein and any other matters set forth therein shall be deemed to be
"finally resolved" for purposes of this _ARTICLE VIII_ when (a) such Claim
Notice, amounts and matters have been resolved by a written agreement executed
by the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person or (b) such Claim
Notice, amounts and matters have been resolved by a final, nonappealable
order, decision or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator
with respect to such matter in dispute, or portion thereof.

  



  

 **Section 8.6 ** _ **Calculation of Damages.**_

  



  

(a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be calculated after reduction for (i) any Tax
benefit inuring to the Indemnified Person on account of such Damage and (ii)
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Person under any insurance
policies and any amounts recoverable pursuant to any indemnification right,
claim, recovery, settlement, reimbursement arrangement, Contract or payment by
or against a third party (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), in
each case relating to such Damages, net of the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in seeking such collection. In the event that an insurance, Tax
benefit or other recovery is made by any Indemnified Persons with respect to
any Damage for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of the insurance, Tax benefit or recovery
shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Person. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the parties agree that no amount shall
be due under this _ARTICLE VIII_ to the extent that it duplicates another
amount already paid or accounted for under this _ARTICLE VIII_ or in the
calculation of the Indebtedness Amount, Net Working Capital Amount,
Transaction Expenses or Closing Tax Amount.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE VIII_ , no
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE
VIII_ (i) for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special (including loss
of revenue, income or profits or a multiple thereof or similar valuation or
diminution in value), exemplary or punitive damages, except for punitive
damages solely to the extent actually paid to an unrelated third party as a
result of a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction in connection with a Third-Party Claim, (ii) for any breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement to the extent
any Indemnified Person knew or was aware of any facts, events or circumstances
constituting or resulting in such breach as of the date of this Agreement or
(iii) Damages attributable to Taxes of any member of the Company Group (A) for
any Post-Closing Tax Period, (B) for any breach by Buyer and/or its Affiliates
of _ARTICLE IX_ , (C) related to the amount, sufficiency or usability of any
net operating loss, capital loss, Tax basis or other Tax asset for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, or (D) as a result of changes in Tax Law occurring after
the Closing Date that have a retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or portion thereof).

  



  

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Person's right to indemnification pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_ on account of any Damages will be reduced by the amount of any
reserve reflected on the Company Group's books and records as of the Closing
Date established for the general category of items or matters similar in
nature to the specific items or matters giving rise to such Damage.

  



  

(d) If any Indemnifying Person makes any indemnification payment pursuant
to this _ARTICLE VIII_ **** or otherwise by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby under any theory of recovery, such Indemnifying Person
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment and to the extent permitted
by Law, to any rights and remedies of the Indemnified Person to recoup amounts
paid from third parties with respect to the matters giving rise to
indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
_ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ ), none of the statements or other items or
anything else in _ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ shall constitute or be deemed
to be a covenant or agreement, and all statements, items and anything else in
_ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ shall constitute and shall be deemed to be only
representations and warranties.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 8.7 ** _ **Acknowledgement by Buyer**_. Buyer acknowledges (on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its Representatives) that:
(a) it has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of Parent and each member of
the Company Group and has been afforded satisfactory access to the books and
records, facilities and personnel of Parent and each member of the Company
Group and for purposes of conducting such investigation and verification,
including, having an opportunity to discuss the business of Parent and each
member of the Company Group with management of Parent and each member of the
Company Group and ask questions of and receive answers from management of
Parent and each member of the Company Group, (b) Parent Representations
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Parent in
connection with the Transactions, (c) except for Parent Representations,
neither Parent, any member of the Company Group nor any other Person makes, or
has made, any other express or implied representation, warranty or statement
with respect to Parent, any member of the Company Group or the Transactions
and all other representations, warranties and statements of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including (i) regarding the completeness or accuracy of,
or any omission to state or to disclose, any information, including in the
estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information, document or
material provided to or made available to Buyer or its Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form, whether written or oral, in expectation of the Transactions,
including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of Parent or any
member of the Company Group, and (ii) any information relating to the future,
current or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, prospects, Contracts, assets or liabilities of Parent or any
member of the Company Group, or the quality, quantity or condition of Parent's
or any member of the Company Group's assets) are, in each case, specifically
disclaimed by Parent and each member of the Company Group and all other
Persons (including Representatives of Parent or any member of the Company
Group) and (d) Buyer and its Affiliates are not relying on any
representations, warranties or statements in connection with the Transactions
except Parent Representations. In connection with Buyer's investigation of
Parent and members of the Company Group, Buyer has received certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and income
from operations of Parent and members of the Company Group and certain
business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts. Without limiting the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 8.7_ , Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of
its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, hereby acknowledges that
none of Parent nor any member of the Company Group nor any of their respective
current or former Affiliates or Representatives is making any representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts, and that none of Buyer, nor any of its
Affiliates have relied on any such estimates, projections or other forecasts
or plans. Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, further
acknowledges that from and after the Closing (i) none of Parent, no member of
the Company Group nor any other Person shall have or be subject to any
liability to Buyer, or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Buyer or any other Person, or Buyer's or any other Person's use of, any such
estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information, document or
material provided to or made available to Buyer or its Affiliates in certain
"data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions, and (ii) neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates have
relied on any such information, document or material. Buyer shall not assert,
institute or maintain any action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding of
any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim, cross-claim or defense,
regardless of the legal or equitable theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the
agreements and covenants set forth in this _Section 8.7_. Parent shall have
the right to enforce this _Section 8.7_ on behalf of any Person that would be
benefitted or protected by this _Section 8.7_ if they were a party hereto. The
foregoing agreements, acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are
irrevocable.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 8.8 ** _ **Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments**_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the

otherwise required by Law.

Forms_ ") and Buyer shall cause AGC America to and Parent shall execute and
deliver, at Closing, two copies of the Section 338 Forms. Parent shall and
Buyer shall cause AGC America to timely file the Section 338 Forms as required

 **Section 9.2 ** _ **Tax Liabilities**_. No Acquired Subsidiary shall
have any liability for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period in respect of (1) US federal income Tax, (2) state income Tax,
in each case, attributable to any such Acquired Subsidiary being a member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group with Parent and/or its
Affiliates. Neltec SA shall not have any liability for income Tax attributable
to Neltec SA being a member of a consolidated group with ParkNelco for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and for the Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

  



  

 **Section 9.3 ** _ **Post-Closing Actions**_. Without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), Buyer and each member of the Company Group shall not (i)
amend any Tax Return relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) extend
or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or
other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (iii) make or change any Tax election or accounting method
that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any member of the
Company Group or (iv) initiate any communication with any Governmental
Authority to voluntarily disclose any failure to pay any Tax, file any Tax
Return or otherwise comply with any Tax Laws with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Buyer shall not make any election under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the acquisition of the Neltec SA Equity.

  



  

 **Section 9.4 ** _ **Transfer Taxes**_. Parent and Buyer shall each pay
50% of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax and other
similar Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest) with respect to the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and any penalties, interest or other additions with respect to the
Transfer Taxes. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer will file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable law, Parent will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

 **Section 9.5 ** _ **Tax Contests**_. Buyer shall notify Parent within
fifteen (15) days after receipt by Buyer or any member of the Company Group of
written notice of any pending federal, state, local or foreign Tax audit or
examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination relating to Taxes or a Tax Return with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (" _Tax Contest_ "). Parent shall have the right to
represent the interests of the Company Group and to employ counsel of its
choice at the expense of Parent with respect to any such Tax Contest
(including any such Tax Contest that is ongoing as of the time of the
Closing); and Buyer shall cause any member of the Company Group to execute any
powers of attorney necessary in order to allow Parent to control such contest
and to settle any such Tax Contest; provided that Parent shall not settle or
otherwise dispose of any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. If Parent elects not to represent the interests of any member of
the Company Group with respect to such Tax Contest, Buyer may represent the
interests of such member of the Company Group. Parent shall, at its expense,
be permitted to participate in any Tax Contest controlled Buyer. Buyer shall
not settle or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Contest without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 9.6 ** _ **Cooperation**_. Parent and Buyer and each member of
the Company Group shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation execution and
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, inquiry, claim for refund,
lawsuit, action, claim, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding at law or
in equity by or before a Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes (each a "Tax
Claim"). Such cooperation shall include access to records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Claim, making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent and
Buyer and each member of the Company Group, shall (a) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Business and the
operations of the Acquired Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the
respective taxable periods and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (b) to give the other party ninety
(90) days written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Parent or Buyer,
as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such
books and records; provided that, the requesting party shall bear all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the other party (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries and employee
benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such books,
records, information or employees.

  



  

 **Section 9.7 ** _ **Tax Refunds**_. Parent shall be entitled to any Tax
refunds (or any credit claimed in lieu of a Tax refund) that are received by
any member of the Company Group, that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of
any member of the Company Group. Buyer shall pay over to Parent any such
refund (or amount of such credit) within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of such refund (or credit). Buyer shall request a refund (rather than a credit
against future Taxes) with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and, at the
request of Parent, shall file any amended Tax Return to claim any such Tax
refund.

  



  

 **Section 9.8 ** _ **Straddle Period**_. In the case of any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts,
or payroll of each member of the Company Group for the period from the start
of such taxable period to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ")
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of each member
of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

  



  

 **Section 9.9 ** _ **Withholding Tax**_. Buyer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the payments to Seller all Taxes that Buyer may be
required to deduct and withhold pursuant to applicable Laws; provided that,
Buyer shall notify, in writing, Seller in respect of which such deduction and
withholding will be made at least five (5) Business Days prior to any such
deduction or withholding of the amount of such expected withholding and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith with Seller to
reduce or eliminate such withholding. To the extent that any such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and timely remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, all such withheld amounts shall be treated as delivered to Seller
hereunder.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 9.10 ** _ **Allocation of Purchase Price**_ **.**

  



  

(a) Subject to the allocation set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ , within 15
days after the determination of Final Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_
, Buyer shall send to Parent a draft of Internal Revenue Service Form 8883
(which allocation shall be in accordance with the methodologies set forth in
_Schedule 9.10(a)_ and Section 1060 of the Code) containing Buyer's proposed
allocation, of the purchase price and other items required under the Code
among the assets of the Acquired Subsidiaries, including an attachment thereto
allocating the amounts by "class". Within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such Form 8883, Parent will notify Buyer whether it disagrees with such
proposed allocation and, in the event of such disagreement, the parties will
make a good faith attempt to reach such agreement. In the event Parent does
not raise any objection to such allocation, both Buyer and Parent shall
prepare all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such allocation. If Buyer
and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such allocation
within 30 days following the date Parent notifies the Buyer of such dispute,
such dispute shall be resolved by the Valuation Firm, and the fees and
expenses of the Valuation Firm shall be borne by Buyer and Parent using the
same methodology used in _Section 2.5_. The Parties shall cooperate in
preparing, executing, and filing with each Taxing Authority all required
information returns, including filing with the Internal Revenue Service all
necessary information returns required by Section 1060 of the Code. The
parties hereto shall make appropriate adjustments to the allocation (as
finally determined under this Section) to reflect adjustments to the purchase
price made after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) For all Tax reporting purposes, the parties shall report the
Transactions consistent with the allocation, as finally determined under this
_Section 9.10_ , and to not take any position on any Tax Return or during the
course of any audit or other proceeding inconsistent with such treatment or
allocation unless required by a determination (as such term is defined under
Section 1313 of the Code).

  



  

 **Section 9.11 ** _ **Settlement of Closing Tax Amount**_.

  



  

(a) In addition to the settlement as provided in _Section 2.4_ and
_Section 2.6_ , no later than five (5) Business Days after the notice to be
issued by Buyer after all of the relevant Tax Returns are filed, (i) if the
total of the Tax Payment Amount is more than the total of the Closing Tax
Amount, the excess (to the extent such excess is an Indemnified Tax) shall be
paid by Parent to Buyer and (ii) if the total of the Tax Payment Amount is
less than the total of the Closing Tax Amount, the excess shall be paid by
Buyer to Parent; provided, however, that such notice shall be delivered not
later than eighteen (18) months after the Closing.

  



  

(b) The Tax Payment Amount shall mean as follows;

  



  

(i) With respect to Taxes for which the taxable period has ended on or
prior to the Closing but as to which the corresponding Tax Return has not been
filed on or prior to the Closing Date, the Tax Payment Amount shall be (1) the
amount of Taxes stated in the relevant Tax Return minus (2) the amount of
Taxes paid prior to the Closing Date with respect to such relevant Tax Return.

  



  

   

  



  

(ii) With respect to Taxes for the Pre-Closing Straddle Period as to which
the Tax Return in respect of such period is required to be filed after the
Closing Date, the Tax Payment Amount shall be (1) the amount of Taxes
calculated in accordance with Section 9.8 minus (2) the amount of Taxes paid
prior to the Closing Date with respect to such relevant Tax Return.

hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such

party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

  



  

 **Section 10.4 ** _ **Assignment**_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by either party without the prior
written consent of the other party; _provided_ that following the Closing,
each party may assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to its
Affiliates, but such assignment shall not relieve such party of its
obligations or liabilities hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 10.4_ shall be null
and void.

  



  

 **Section 10.5 ** _ **Counterparts**_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other parties.

  



  

 **Section 10.6 ** _ **Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries**_.
This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule, the Transaction Documents
and the exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for (i) the Indemnitees and
their Representatives under _Section 5.8_ , (ii) the rights of each such Non-

 **Section 10.7 ** _ **Governing Law; Jurisdiction.**_

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  



  

(b) Other than disputes submitted to the Valuation Firm pursuant to
_Section 2.5(b)_ (which shall be addressed in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.5(b)_ ) (i) all actions and proceedings arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents shall be

Southern District of New York, (ii) no party shall attempt to deny or defeat

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

  



  

(c) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 10.7_ in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article X_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

  



  

 **Section 10.8 ** _ **Specific Enforcement**_. The parties acknowledge
that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, if for any reason Buyer
or Parent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and
other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Prior to the Closing, to the extent any party
hereto brings any action, claim, complaint or other proceeding, in each case,
before any Governmental Authority to enforce specifically the performance of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which
such action, claim, complaint or other proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, claim, complaint or other proceeding.

DOCUMENTS, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE

CLAIM, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER BASED ON

OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTY HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as

to "$" and dollars in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars unless

shall mean a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or
failure to act by a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such

directive and obligation, and not an option. All references to "party" shall
mean Buyer and Parent unless otherwise specifically provided. All references
to "parties" shall mean Buyer or Parent unless otherwise specifically
provided. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have such defined meanings
when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to

well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,

exception to one or more representations, warranties or provisions contained
in _Article I_ or _Article III_ or to one or more of the covenants contained
in _ARTICLE V_ , except that any information set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to all other sections or
subsections thereof to the extent the relevance of such information to such
other section of the Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face.
The Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
specific provisions of this Agreement, and is not intended to constitute, and
shall not be deemed to constitute, representations, warranties or covenants of
the parties, except as (and solely to the extent) expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Information contained in the Disclosure Schedule is not necessarily
limited to information required to be contained in the Disclosure Schedule by

(c) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended
to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement, in the
Disclosure Schedule or any Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract).

  



  

(d) Any reference to "fraud" shall mean only willful and intentional
fraud.

  



  

 **Section 10.15 **_**No Recourse**_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement or otherwise, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge on
their own behalf and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
that no Non-Recourse Party with respect to a party to this Agreement shall
have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions
except to the extent expressly agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse
Party.

  



  

 **Section 10.16 **_**Provision Respecting Legal Representation**_. It is
acknowledged by each of the parties hereto, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its respective managers, directors, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, that Parent and Company Group have
retained Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP (the " _Retained Counsel_ ") to
act as their counsel in connection with the Transactions and that the Retained
Counsel have not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection
with the Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status
of a client of any of the Retained Counsel for conflict of interest or any
other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer and its Subsidiaries hereby agree,
on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective directors, managers,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in
the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, any member of
the Company Group and/or any of their Subsidiaries on the one hand, and Parent
or any of its equityholders or Affiliates, on the other hand, any of the
Retained Counsel may represent Parent and any of its equityholders or
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of Parent or any of its
equityholders or Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, a member of the
Company Group or any of their Subsidiaries, and even though such Retained
Counsel may have represented Parent and such member(s) of the Company Group in
a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Buyer, a member of the Company Group or any of their Subsidiaries.
Buyer further acknowledges that, as to all communications among the Retained
Counsel, Parent or any of its equityholders or Affiliates, or any member of
the Company Group that relate in any way to the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to Parent, and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or
any member of the Company Group following the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any member of
the Company Group and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or
any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, such member of the
Company Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by any of the Retained Counsel to such third
party or the use thereof by such Retained Counsel in connection with its
representation of a party in such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
member of the Company Group may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Parent.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Section 10.17 **_**Delivery by Electronic Transmission**_. This
Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or
contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
contract, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.
