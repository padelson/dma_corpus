Closing Date (collectively, and net to Debtors working interest for purposes
of this _Section 2.01(ii)(B)_, the "Reimbursed Expenditures"); _provided_
that to the extent any Reimbursed Expenditures are incurred from and after
the Allocation Date but are not paid prior to the Closing Date, the obligation
to perform and pay when due such Reimbursed Expenditures shall vest in the
Reorganized Debtors, and (z) an amount equal to the value (net of Non-Income
Taxes) of the Debtors interest (such interest net of royalty and overriding
royalty interests, other working interests and other similar interests or
burdens on production or proceeds thereof being referred to in this paragraph
as "Debtors Interest") in crude oil in storage tanks as of the Closing Date
(excluding tank fill that is neither merchantable nor marketable) that is
collectable by the customary mode of collection in the normal course of
business ("Closing Date Tank Oil"), to be calculated as follows: the value
(net of Non-Income Taxes) shall be the product of (a) the volume of marketable
Closing Date Tank Oil (attributable to Debtors Interest) measured in 



 

17  barrels as of the Closing Date as shown by the gauging reports prepared by
the Debtors as of the Closing Date (absent any manifest errors), multiplied by
(b) the posted price per barrel for Oklahoma sweet crude oil as of the
Closing Date as reflected in the Crude Oil Price Bulletin Recap posted by
Plains Marketing, L.P., less $2.39 per barrel; and

(C) shall be adjusted downward by (y) $90,322.58 per calendar day from and
including the Allocation Date up to but excluding the Closing Date, and (z)
the aggregate amount of liabilities that are required by GAAP to be accrued on
the books and records of the Debtors in the Ordinary Course of Business in
respect of all Non-Income Taxes as of the Allocation Date (to the extent such
Non-Income Taxes are not paid by the Debtors on or prior to the Closing Date)
(the "Accrued Tax Liabilities"); _provided_ that the SandRidge Parties shall
(i) pay or cause to be paid within five Business Days after the Closing Date
all Taxes to which Accrued Tax Liabilities relate that are due or payable as
of the Closing and (ii) prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of
Debtors related to the Accrued Tax Liabilities in the manner described in

of SandRidge Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants may contain such
appropriate legends, as determined by SandRidge in its reasonable discretion,
in accordance with the Plan Support Agreement, including a legend evidencing
(a) the Lock-Up Restrictions and (b) to the extent that any such certificate
is being issued to a Second Lien Holder that either is not a Consenting Second
Lien Holder (as defined in the Plan Support Agreement) or has not otherwise
provided to SandRidge such documents, representations, certification or other
information required by Section 3.5 of the Plan Support Agreement, such other
restrictions so as to ensure that the offering and issuance of the
Stock Consideration, the Warrants and the shares of SandRidge Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Warrants shall be exempt from registration under the 1933
Act pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4(2) of the
1933 Act and any other applicable federal, State or securities laws.

instruments as may be necessary to evidence the conveyance, transfer and
assignment to the Liquidating Trust of the Trust Assets), and the Trust
Liabilities (together with the obligations of the Liquidating Trust with
respect to the Claims, with any Liens securing such Claims attaching to the
Trust Assets, as set forth in the Plan) shall vest in, and be the

Trust Assets may, at the direction of Crusader or the Liquidating Trustee, be
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered to Newco rather than to the
Liquidating Trust. 



 

19 (c) If the aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration plus the Closing Cash
Balance (collectively, the "Closing Cash Amount") is less than the aggregate
amount of (i) all Cure Costs and other payments in respect of Allowed Claims
(as defined in the Plan) that must, pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan,
be paid by Crusader, any Crusader Subsidiary, any Reorganized Debtor or the
Liquidating Trustee on the Closing Date and (ii) cash required to establish
reserves pursuant to Section 4.6(a) of the Liquidating Trust Agreement (the
aggregate of (i) and (ii), the "Trust Closing Cash Requirement Amount"), then
Buyer shall make a senior loan (the "Closing Loan") to the Liquidating Trust
in an amount (the "Closing Loan Amount") equal to the amount by which the

more than $30,000,000), which loan shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the Closing Loan Agreement;

(d) Reorganized Crusader shall issue the New Crusader Shares to Buyer, and

securities may not be sold, offered for sale, pledged or hypothecated in the
absence of a registration statement in effect with respect to the securities
under the Securities Act and any such state securities laws or the issuer has

days, thereafter effect the issuance of all Indemnity Reserved Shares,

Trustee, or (ii) record and reflect on the stock transfer records of SandRidge
record ownership of the Indemnity Reserved Shares in the name of the Second
Lien Agent or, if requested by the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating
Trustee, in such names and evidencing such whole number of shares of SandRidge
Stock (in an aggregate amount equal to the number of Indemnity Reserved

(e) If the Stock Consideration shall have been reduced pursuant to clause (B)
of _Section 2.01(i)_ and the condition to Closing set forth in _Section

_Section 8.03(b)_ is satisfied), SandRidge shall make a reasonable estimate
of the aggregate amount of Litigation Damages for all Litigation Matters
(calculated with a reasonable contingency reserve), including
amounts previously incurred or suffered (each such estimate, "Estimated

SandRidge shall promptly, and in any event within five calendar days
thereafter effect the issuance of a number of Indemnity Reserved Shares equal
to (A) the total number of Indemnity Reserve Shares minus (B) the total number
of Indemnity Reserve Shares that have previously been delivered pursuant to
this  _Section 2.03(e)_, minus (C) (i) the Estimated Damages divided by (ii)

if requested by the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating Trustee, in such
names and evidencing such whole number of Indemnity Reserved Shares to be
issued pursuant to this _Section 2.03(e)_ (in an aggregate amount equal to
the number of Indemnity Reserved Shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section

$10,000,000, SandRidge shall promptly, and in any event within 60 calendar
days after the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 8.03(b)_ is
satisfied, effect the issuance of a number of Indemnity Reserved Shares equal
to (A) the total number of Indemnity Reserve Shares minus (B) the total
number of Indemnity Reserve Shares that have previously been delivered

2.03(f) or, if requested by the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating Trustee,
stock certificates, in such names and evidencing such whole number
of Indemnity Reserved Shares (in an aggregate amount equal to the number of
Indemnity Reserved Shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section 2.03(f))_,
as requested by the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating Trustee, or (2)
record and reflect on the stock transfer records of SandRidge record
ownership of the Indemnity Reserved Shares to be issued pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(f)_ in the name of the Second Lien Agent or, if requested by
the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating Trustee, in such names and
evidencing such whole number of Indemnity Reserved Shares to be issued
pursuant to this _Section 2.03(f)_ (in an aggregate amount equal to the
number of Indemnity Reserved Shares to be issued pursuant to this _Section
2.03(f)_), as requested by the Second Lien Agent or the Liquidating Trustee.
SandRidge shall provide all details and related information it utilized to
determine the Final Litigation Damages to the Consenting Second Lien Holders
(as defined in the Plan Support Agreement). Such calculation of the Final
Litigation Damages shall be binding upon SandRidge, all Consenting Second Lien
Holders and, to the extent legally permitted, all Second Lien Holders to the
extent it accurately reflects the Litigation Damages for all Litigation
Matters. Any dispute regarding the calculation or amount of the Final
Litigation Damages shall be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court.

(g) If, at any time, the aggregate amount of Litigation Damages incurred or
suffered by SandRidge and its Subsidiaries prior to such time is equal to or
greater than $10,000,000, SandRidge shall have no obligation at such time or
at any time thereafter to issue or deliver to any Person any Indemnity

Section 2.04 _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of SandRidge Stock,
and no Warrants to purchase any fractional shares of SandRidge Stock, shall
be issued to any Person pursuant to _Section 2.01_, _Section 2.02_, _Section
2.03_, _Section 2.08_ or the Plan. If any fractional shares of SandRidge

provisions hereof and thereof, the number of shares of SandRidge Stock to be
issued to such Person shall be rounded to the nearest whole share of SandRidge
Stock (with .5 being rounded up).

Section 2.05 _Prepaid JOA Funds_. To the extent that as of Closing, any Debtor
holds funds received by Debtors (in their capacity as operator with respect
to the Operated Properties) as prepayments for items under operating
agreements for which a payable has not been incurred as of the Allocation Date
(solely to the extent related to Assumed Contracts (as defined in the
Plan), "Prepaid JOA Funds") (a) no adjustment to the Purchase Consideration
shall be made with respect to such Prepaid JOA Funds or any funds received by
Debtors that would constitute Prepaid JOA Funds if such funds were related
to Assumed Contracts and (b) at and as of the 



 

24  Closing, all of the Prepaid JOA Funds shall vest in the Reorganized Debtors

holds funds received by Debtors (in their capacity as operator with respect to
the Operated Properties) in "suspense" (excluding any joint interest billings
received by Debtors, in their capacity as operator with respect to the
Operated Properties, on or prior to the Petition Date that any Debtor holds as
of the Closing) (solely to the extent related to Assumed Contracts, "Suspense
Funds") (a) no adjustment to the Purchase Consideration shall be made with
respect to such Suspense Funds or any funds received by Debtors that would
constitute Suspense Funds if such funds were related to Assumed Contracts and
(b) at and as of the Closing all of the Suspense Funds shall vest in the
Reorganized Debtors pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_ and the Reorganized Debtors
shall from and after such time be responsible for the application of such
Suspense Funds under the applicable operating or other agreement governing the
application of such Suspense Funds.

Section 2.07 _Closing Accounts Receivables_.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Debtors shall deliver to SandRidge a statement
setting forth (i) the names of the obligor and amount of each Closing Account
Receivable, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all the Closing Accounts
Receivable (as such statement may be modified or supplemented within 30 days
after the Closing Date by written notice of the Liquidating Trustee to
SandRidge, the "Closing Accounts Receivables Statement").

(b) From and after the Closing until the date that is 179 calendar days after
the Closing Date, SandRidge shall use the same level of efforts in the
collection of the Closing Accounts Receivable that SandRidge and its
Subsidiaries use in the collection of their own accounts receivables;
_provided_ that (i) SandRidge (A) may settle any Closing Accounts Receivable
by setoff (each such setoff, an "Optional Accounts Receivable Setoff") of any
amounts owed by the obligor thereunder against any amount that SandRidge or
any of its Subsidiaries owes to such obligor if SandRidge gives written notice
to the Liquidating Trustee of each Optional Accounts Receivable Setoff on or
prior to the Maturity Date (as defined in the Closing Loan Agreement), (B)
shall settle any Closing Accounts Receivable by setoff (each such setoff, a
"Mandatory Accounts Receivable Setoff" and, together with the Optional
Accounts Receivable Setoffs, the "Accounts Receivable Setoffs") of any amounts
owed by the obligor thereunder against any amount that any Reorganized Debtor
owes to such obligor to the extent such Mandatory Accounts Receivable Setoff
is permitted under Applicable Law, and (C) SandRidge shall not be permitted to
effect any Accounts Receivable Setoff unless SandRidge shall have given such
written notice to the Liquidating Trustee on or prior to the Maturity Date,
(ii) SandRidge must obtain the prior written consent of the Liquidating
Trustee (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed by the Liquidating Trustee) to settle (whether in cash or by way of
an Accounts Receivable Setoff) any Closing Accounts Receivable for an amount
less than the applicable amount set forth on the Closing Accounts Receivables
Statement, (iii) neither SandRidge nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Reorganized Debtors) shall be required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses or
admit or consent to any liability or obligation in connection with the
collection of any Closing Accounts Receivable and 



 

25  (iv) prior to commencing any litigation in connection with the collection of
any Closing Accounts Receivable, SandRidge will obtain the prior written
consent of the Liquidating Trustee and will have no obligation to commence or
prosecute any litigation unless and until arrangements acceptable to SandRidge
and the Liquidating Trustee are made to ensure that all of SandRidges costs
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
such litigation shall be fully paid, reimbursed or otherwise compensated. Each
Party acknowledges that SandRidge is making efforts to collect the Closing
Accounts Receivable hereunder acting solely pursuant to a contractual
relationship on an arms length basis and that the Parties do not intend that
SandRidge act or be responsible as a fiduciary to the Liquidating Trust, any
holders of Claims or any other Person, and expressly disclaim any
such fiduciary relationship, whether between or among any SandRidge Parties,
on the one hand, and any Debtors and/or the Liquidating Trust, on the other
hand. SandRidge and any Person acting on its behalf shall not be liable for
any act or omission taken, or omitted to be taken, related to, or in
connection with, the collection of the Closing Accounts Receivables, other
than acts or omissions resulting from such Persons willful misconduct, gross
negligence or fraud. In the case of an Accounts Receivable Setoff pursuant to
clause (b)(i) of this _Section 2.07_, the date of such Accounts Receivable
Setoff shall be the earlier of (A) the date notice of such Accounts Receivable
Setoff is delivered to the Liquidating Trustee pursuant to this _Section
2.07(b)_ and (B) the date such Accounts Receivable Setoff is reflected on the
books of SandRidge or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) SandRidge shall promptly apply the amount of any and all cash collected in
respect of Closing Account Receivables and the amount of any and all Accounts
Receivable Setoffs (collectively, the "Accounts Receivable Collections") to
the then outstanding amount of the principal, interest and other amounts
payable in respect of the Closing Loan (if any). To the extent that no
principal, interest or other amounts payable in respect of the Closing Loan
are then outstanding, SandRidge shall promptly deliver the amount of any and
all Accounts Receivable Collections to the Liquidating Trust. Within ten
calendar days after the last day of each calendar month completed after the
Closing Date and through the month in which the 179th calendar day after the
Closing Date occurs, SandRidge shall deliver to the Liquidating Trust a
statement setting forth (i) the aggregate amount of all the Accounts
Receivable Collections, and (ii) the then outstanding amount of principal,
interest and other amounts payable in respect of the Closing Loan, if any.

(d) On the date that is 180 calendar days after the Closing Date, SandRidge
shall (i) deliver to the Liquidating Trust a statement setting forth (A) the
names of the obligor and amount of each Closing Accounts Receivable that
remains uncollected, whether by cash or setoff (collectively, the "Remaining
Accounts Receivables"); (B) the aggregate amount of all the Remaining
Accounts Receivables; and (C) the then outstanding amount of the principal,
interest and other amounts payable in respect of the Closing Loan (if any),
and (ii) convey, transfer, assign and deliver to the Liquidating Trust all
the Remaining Accounts Receivables.

Section 2.08 _Subject Property_.

(a) If, as of Closing, the Oil and Gas Interests of Debtors subject to the
matter described in item 5 of _Schedule 3.11_ (the "Subject Property") cannot
be vested in the 



 

26  Reorganized Debtors free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Post-
Closing Liens after giving effect to the Confirmation Order then, at
SandRidges option, at Closing, either: 

(i) the Subject Property will be included as Trust Assets and will not be
vested in the Reorganized Debtors at Closing, and the Stock Consideration
will be reduced by the number of shares of SandRidge Stock equal to (A) the
Allocated Value (as defined below) of the Subject Property divided by (B) the
SandRidge Stock Value, subject to  _Section 2.08_; or

(ii) the Subject Property, together with all assets that relate to the
Subject Property (including the interests described in item 4 of _Schedule
2.02_ and any joint interest billings owed to any Debtor by a plaintiff or any
Subsidiary of any plaintiff in the matter described in item 5 of _Schedule
3.11_ ), shall be vested in the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to this
Agreement and the Plan, and the Stock Consideration shall not be reduced
pursuant to this _Section 2.08_.

(b) The "Allocated Value" of the Subject Property shall be the fair market
value of the Subject Property at the Closing, assuming that the Subject
Property is free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Post-Closing
Liens, which shall be (i) such fair market value as agreed by SandRidge and
Crusader (or, after the Closing, the Liquidating Trust) in good faith or (ii)
if SandRidge and Crusader are unable to agree on such fair market value
within ten Business Days after the Closing Date, such fair market value as
determined by the Arbiter in accordance with _Section 2.08(c)_.

(c) If SandRidge and Crusader (or, after the Closing, the Liquidating Trust)
are unable to reach agreement on the Allocated Value of the Subject Property
within ten Business Days after the Closing Date, SandRidge and the Liquidating
Trust shall jointly engage an independent firm with experience in valuing oil
and gas assets similar to the Subject Property mutually acceptable
to SandRidge and the Liquidating Trustee) (such firm, the "Arbiter") to
determine the Allocated Value. In connection with the engagement of the
Arbiter, each of SandRidge and Liquidating Trust shall execute any engagement,
indemnity, and other agreements as the Arbiter shall reasonably require as a
condition to such engagement. If the SandRidge and the Liquidating Trustee are
unable to agree on the Arbiter or its terms of engagement, either SandRidge or
the Liquidating Trustee may in writing request that the Bankruptcy Court
appoint the Arbiter.

(d) SandRidge and the Liquidating Trust shall require the Arbiter in its
terms of engagement to determine the Allocated Value of the Subject Property
within 20 days after the engagement of the Arbiter. The determination by the
Arbiter of the Allocated Value shall be set forth in a written
notice delivered by the Arbiter to SandRidge and the Liquidating Trustee,
shall assume that the Subject Property is free and clear of all Liens other
than Permitted Post-Closing Liens, and shall be binding and conclusive on the
Parties, all Consenting Second Lien Holders and, to the extent legally
permitted, all Second Lien Holders and the Liquidating Trust, and such
determination shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereof. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be paid one-
half by SandRidge and one-half by the Liquidating Trust.



 

27 (e) If the Subject Property is included as Trust Assets pursuant to  _Section
2.08(a)(i)_ but the Allocated Value of the Subject Property is not determined
as of the Closing Date, then at the Closing the shares of SandRidge Stock
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.01(i)_ shall be reduced by (i) a number of
shares of SandRidge Stock equal to $5,000,000 divided by (ii) the SandRidge
Stock Value (the "SP Reserved Shares") and, upon determination of the
Allocated Value by mutual agreement between SandRidge and the Liquidating
Trustee or by the Arbiter in accordance with _Section 2.08(c)_ and _(d)_ ,
SandRidge shall effect the issuance of a number of the SP Reserved Shares
equal to (x) the total number of SP Reserved Shares minus (y) (1) the
Allocated Value divided by (2) the SandRidge Stock Value, such issuance to be
effected in the same manner as provided in _Section 2.02(e)(i)_. If the
Closing occurs, the reduction of the Stock Consideration pursuant to this
_Section 2.08(e)_ shall be the SandRidge Parties sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any failure of the Subject Property to be free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Post-Closing Liens.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.07_, from June 26, 2008 to May 11,
2009, Crusader filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules,

and effect, and no Debtor party to any such Contract or, to Crusaders
Knowledge, any other party thereto is in default or breach under the terms of
any such Contract, and, to Crusaders Knowledge, no event or circumstance has

the aggregate, a Crusader Material Adverse Effect.

(c) _Schedule 3.10(c)_ sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, all 365
Contracts that have been assumed by any Debtor.

Section 3.11 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.11_, as of

pending in the Bankruptcy Cases, there is no Proceeding pending against or, to
Crusaders Knowledge, threatened against or affecting any Debtor or any
present or former officer, director or employee of any Debtor that (i) if

Section 3.12 _Compliance with Laws and Court Orders_. To Crusaders Knowledge,
as of the date of this Agreement each Debtor is, and for the past six years
(or, in the case of Crusader, since June 26, 2008) has been, in compliance in
all material respects with and is not under investigation with respect to and
has not been threatened to be charged with or given notice of any violation
in any material respect of any Applicable Law. There is no judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority
outstanding against 



 

33  any Debtor that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Crusader Material Adverse Effect, (ii) in
any manner seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the
Transactions or (iii) affects the execution, delivery or performance by any
Debtor of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which any Debtor
is or will be a party. This _Section 3.12_ is not, and shall not be deemed
to be, any representation or warranty with respect to employee benefit
matters, which are covered exclusively in _Section 3.22_, or Environmental
Law, which are covered exclusively in _Section 3.23_ or Taxes, which are
covered exclusively in _Section 3.24_.

Section 3.13 _Properties_. No Debtor owns, and no Debtor has (or, in the case
of Crusader, since June 26, 2008, Crusader has not) owned, any real property
other than the Oil and Gas Interests. Other than with respect to the Oil and
Gas Interests, and except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.13_, no Debtor has
received notice of any adverse claim to its title to, or leasehold interests
in, any of its property (whether real, personal, tangible or intangible), and,
to Crusaders Knowledge, such title and leasehold interest is free and clear
of Liens other than Permitted Liens.

Section 3.14 _Oil and Gas Interests_. 

(a) Crusader has furnished to SandRidge prior to the date hereof the report
estimating the Debtors proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2008,
as prepared by Crusader and audited by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd.
(the "Crusader Reserve Report"). To Crusaders Knowledge, the factual, non-
interpretive data on which the Crusader Reserve Report was based for purposes
of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Crusader Reserve
Report (and in any supplement thereto or update thereof) was accurate in all
material respects as of the date of the Crusader Reserve Report, except that
if there are any differences between any percentage net revenue interest or
working interest set forth on the Crusader Reserve Report and the
corresponding percentage set forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_, the percentage set
forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_ should be relied upon as the correct percentage.
To Crusaders Knowledge, the Crusader Reserve Report conforms to the
guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon prices) generally affecting the oil and gas
industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no material change
in respect of the matters addressed in the Crusader Reserve Report, except
that if there are any differences between any percentage net revenue interest
or working interest set forth on the Crusader Reserve Report and the
corresponding percentage set forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_, the percentage set
forth on _Schedule 3.14(e)_ should be relied upon as the correct percentage.

(b) All Wells included in the Oil and Gas Interests that are operated
by Debtors ("Operated Properties") have been drilled and (if completed)
completed, operated and produced in all material respects in accordance with
reasonable, prudent oil and gas field practices and, to Crusaders Knowledge,
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Oil and Gas Agreements
and Applicable Laws. To Crusaders Knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, no Debtor is in violation in any material respect of any Applicable
Law or Contract requiring any Debtor to plug and abandon any Well because the
Well is not currently capable of producing in commercial quantities or for any
other reasons.



 

34 (c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(c)_, to Crusaders Knowledge,
the proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Operated
Properties are being received by the Debtors and are not being held in
suspense for any reason.

(d) No Debtor has received any material advance, take-or-pay or other similar
payments that entitle purchasers of production to receive deliveries of
Hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and, on a net, company-wide basis, the
Debtors properties are neither underproduced nor overproduced, in either
case, to any material extent, under gas balancing or similar arrangements.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth on _Schedule
3.14(e)_, to Crusaders Knowledge the Debtors, collectively, have free of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens such right, title and interest as to each Oil
and Gas Interest that (i) entitles Debtors to receive not less than the
interest set forth in _Schedule 3.14(e)_ as the "Net Revenue Interest" or
"NRI" with respect to all of the oil, gas, and other Hydrocarbons produced,
saved and marketed from or otherwise attributable to each unit or Well, as the
case may be, identified in  _Schedule 3.14(e)_ (subject to rounding) and
(ii) obligates Debtors to pay costs and expenses attributable to the operation
and development of such unit or Well in an amount not greater than the
"Working Interest" or "WI" set forth in _Schedule 3.14(e)_ (subject to
rounding) other than increases in any such working interest that have a
corresponding increase in the applicable net revenue interest. The SandRidge
Parties acknowledge that neither Debtors nor the individuals included in the
definition of Crusaders Knowledge have performed any review of any abstracts,
title opinions or other materials relating to title of the Oil and Gas
Interests in connection with the Transactions. The SandRidge Parties further
acknowledge that the SandRidge Parties have conducted their own due diligence
and review of abstracts, title opinions and other matters and materials that
the SandRidge Parties deem necessary to be conducted prior to execution of
this Agreement with respect to ascertaining the status of title to the Oil and
Gas Interests. No SandRidge Party shall have any rights under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, or otherwise
against Debtors, with respect to the representation or warranty of Crusader
set forth under this _Section 3.14(e)_ except in the event of an intentional,
knowing breach of the representation and warranty of Debtors contained
in this _Section 3.14(e)_.

(f) No claim, notice or order from any Governmental Authority or other Person
has been received by any Debtor due to Hydrocarbon production from the Oil
and Gas Interests in excess of allowable production established pursuant to
Applicable Law that would result in any material curtailment of production
from the Oil and Gas Interests after the Closing Date.

(g) To Crusaders Knowledge, all material operating equipment owned or leased
by any Debtor is, in the aggregate, in a state of repair so as to be adequate
in all material respects for reasonably prudent operations in the areas in
which they are operated.

(h) To Crusaders Knowledge, except as described in _Schedule 3.14(h)_, none
of the material Oil and Gas Interests is subject to any preferential purchase
or similar right which would become operative, and no Oil and Gas Agreement
permits any Third Party to elect a new operator with respect to any Operated
Property, as a result of the Transactions.



 

35 (i) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.14(i)_, the Oil and Gas Interests are
not subject to any tax partnership agreement or provisions requiring a
partnership income tax return to be filed under Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of
Subtitle A of the Code.

Section 3.15 _Hedging_. No Debtor is bound by any futures, hedge, swap,
collar, put, call, floor, cap, option or other Contract that is intended to
benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in
the price of commodities, including Hydrocarbons, or securities.

Section 3.16 _Natural Gas Act_. None of the facilities or operations of any
gas gathering system constituting a part of the properties of any Debtor are
certificated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") under
Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (the "NGA") or, to Crusaders Knowledge,
are now subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA; and none of the properties
are providing service pursuant to Section 311 of the National Gas Policy Act
of 1978. 

Section 3.17 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) To Crusaders Knowledge, _Schedule 3.17(a)(i)_ contains a true and
complete list of each of the registrations and applications for registrations
included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights, and _Schedule
3.17(a)(ii)_ contains a true and complete list of all agreements, excluding
licenses for personal computer software that are generally available, to which
any Debtor is a party or otherwise bound, granting or restricting any right
to use, exploit or practice any Intellectual Property Rights that are used in

(B), an "Alternative Bidder"), and (ii) furnish to such Alternative Bidder and
its Representatives, and to any other Third Party that has made a request
therefor in connection with its consideration of making an offer or proposal
relating to a Alternative Transaction, public or non-public information
relating to any Debtor pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such
Alternative Bidder containing terms that are no less favorable to Crusader
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated February 3, 2009,
as amended April 28, 2009, between Crusader and SandRidge (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and afford to any such Alternative Bidder who has
signed a confidentiality agreement access to any properties, assets, books or

such Alternative Bidder and (ii) Alternative Bidders who have signed a
confidentiality agreement prior to the date of this Agreement shall not be

long as such confidentiality agreement has a remaining term of not less than
90 days from the date hereof.

(c) Crusader agrees that it will not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(e)(i)_, unless (i) it receives prior to the Bid Deadline an
offer or proposal for an Alternative Transaction that the Board of Directors
reasonably believes in its business judgment constitutes or could lead to a
Superior Proposal and (ii) an Alternative Transaction is selected as the
Successful Bid pursuant to the Bid Protection Order.

Section 5.03 _Additional Financial Information_.

(a) Crusader agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide
SandRidge with (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Debtors as
of December 31, 2008 (the "2008 Balance Sheet") and the audited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows of the Debtors, for the year then
ended, including any notes thereto, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof; (ii) simultaneously with the provision of the 2008 Balance Sheet,
Crusader will provide SandRidge with (A) a written representation from an
authorized officer of Crusader that the deferred tax asset for property
and equipment reported in the footnotes to the 2008 Crusader audited
financial statements consists solely of the tax effect of the difference in
the value of the tax basis and book basis for property and equipment and such
statement shall specify the amounts of each of the tax basis and book basis
relating to oil and gas assets and to non-oil and gas assets as of December
31, 2008, and (B) a true-up of _Schedule 3.24(d)_ based on the actual results
of the 2008 federal income tax return (Form 1120) filed by Crusader; (iii)
financial statements of the Debtors (in the same format as the June 30, 2009
trial balance which is attached as a part of Part II of _Schedule 3.08_ ) for
each calendar month completed after June 30, 2009, and on or prior to
September 30, 2009, in each case by no later than October 26, 2009; (iv)
financial statements of the Debtors (in the same format as the June 30, 2009
trial balance which is attached as a part of Part II of _Schedule 3.08_ ) for

Closing Date, within 25 calendar days after the end of each such month; and
(v) the unaudited (but reviewed by KPMG LLP) consolidated balance sheet and
unaudited 



 

50  consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Debtors for each
of the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30,
2009 prior to Closing, ((i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) collectively, the
"Post-Signing Financial Statements").

(b) Crusader shall cause the Post-Signing Financial Statements delivered in
accordance with _Section 5.03(a)_ to fairly present, to Crusaders Knowledge,
in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated
financial position of the Debtors as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject to normal year end audit adjustments and the absence of notes in the
case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

(c) Prior to the Closing, Crusader agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the SandRidge Parties with any financial statements,
financial information or other related financial documentation, and to cause
its management to provide any such consents, management letters or other
related financial documentation to KPMG LLP related to the Debtors, in each
case as reasonably requested by SandRidge in connection with the preparation
by SandRidge of any financial reports required pursuant to Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X or otherwise required under the 1933 Act or 1934 Act.

Section 5.04 _Assumption and Rejection of Executory Contracts and Leases_.

(a) _Schedule 5.04(a)_ sets forth a complete set of the most
recent "Schedule G  Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases" of the Debtors
that has been filed with the Bankruptcy Court prior to the date hereof (as
such schedules may from time to time be amended or supplemented with written
notice to the SandRidge Parties, the "365 Schedule"). Crusader agrees to
amend or supplement the 365 Schedule from time to time promptly, and to
provide the SandRidge Parties written notice thereof, upon its determination
that any Debtor is party to a 365 Contract that is not then set forth on the
365 Schedule. At least 10 days prior to the date of mailing of notice in
accordance with the Bid Protection Order (the "365 Notice Date") to
all parties to 365 Contracts to be assumed, Crusader will deliver to
SandRidge a copy of the 365 Schedule together with Crusaders good faith
estimate of the Cure Costs that would be payable by any Debtor in connection
with the assumption of each 365 Contract and, to the extent practicable, a
good faith estimate of the rejection damages that would be payable by any
Debtor in connection with the rejection of each 365 Contract (the actual
amount of such rejection damages that would be payable by any Debtor pursuant
to the Plan, as finally determined, "Rejection Amount"). If Crusader has not
previously provided or made available to the SandRidge Parties a copy of any
such 365 Contract, including any amendments, waivers or other modifications
thereof, Crusader shall upon SandRidges request (i) provide a copy of such
365 Contract to SandRidge if Crusader has a copy of such 365 Contract readily
available in its files or (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a copy of such 365 Contract if Crusader does not have a copy of such
365 Contract readily available in its files and, upon obtaining a copy,
provide a copy of such 365 Contract to SandRidge.

(b) No later than 3 days prior to the 365 Notice Date, SandRidge shall
provide Crusader with a list of the 365 Contracts listed on the 365 Schedule
received from Crusader that the SandRidge Parties desire to be assumed by the
Debtor party thereto (collectively, and as 



 

51  further modified by the SandRidge Parties pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 5.04(b)_, the "Desired 365 Contracts"). As promptly as practicable
following the designation by the SandRidge Parties of any 365 Contract as a
Desired 365 Contract, the Debtors shall commence appropriate proceedings
before the Bankruptcy Court and otherwise take all necessary actions in order
to determine the Cure Costs with respect to such Desired 365 Contract and to
effect the assumption of such Desired 365 Contract by the applicable Debtor in
accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, effective as of the Closing. Furthermore,
Crusader shall take all necessary actions in order to effect the rejection or
assignment to the Liquidating Trust (or, at the direction of Crusader or the
Liquidating Trustee, to Newco) by the applicable Debtor of each 365 Contract
that is not a Desired 365 Contract at or prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) at any time prior to twelve calendar days
before the commencement of the Confirmation Hearing (or, if any 365 Contract
is first identified to SandRidge by Crusader or first identified to Crusader
by SandRidge between the beginning of such twelve calendar days and the
commencement of the Confirmation Hearing, within one Business Day of such
identification), SandRidge may designate any 365 Contract that has not been
rejected as a Desired 365 Contract and upon receipt of any such notice Debtors
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the assumption of such 365
Contract by the applicable Debtor in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and,
if Debtors are successful in effecting such assumption as of Closing, such 365
Contract shall become a Desired 365 Contract and (y) at any time prior to
twelve calendar days before the commencement of the Confirmation
Hearing SandRidge may designate any Desired 365 Contract that has not been
assumed as one that the SandRidge Parties no longer desire to have assumed and
such 365 Contract shall be deemed not to be a Desired 365 Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, SandRidge shall designate a
Contract that contains the terms set forth on _Exhibit F_ and is otherwise
reasonably acceptable to SandRidge as a Desired 365 Contract and shall not
have any rights to designate such Contract not to be a Desired 365 Contract,
and such Contract shall be deemed a Desired 365 Contract for all purposes
hereunder.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Crusader shall pay, or cause its Subsidiaries
to pay, or cause the Liquidating Trust after the Closing to pay all Cure Costs
with respect to the Desired 365 Contracts, and the Debtors shall
provide adequate assurance of future performance of all of the Desired 365
Contracts so that all Desired 365 Contracts can be assumed by the Debtors at
or prior to the Closing in accordance with the provisions of Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code and this Agreement (provided that the SandRidge Parties
shall cooperate with Debtors in providing such adequate assurance of future
performance of all of the Desired 365 Contracts and the SandRidge Parties
acknowledge that such cooperation may require the SandRidge Parties to
provide information regarding SandRidge and its Subsidiaries, as well as a
commitment of performance by SandRidge and/or its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Desired 365 Contracts from and after the Closing to demonstrate adequate
assurance of the performance of the Desired 365 Contracts, and the Debtors
obligation to provide such adequate assurances is subject to the cooperation
and providing of such information and commitment by the SandRidge Parties).
Except as set forth in this _Section 5.04(c)_ and in _Section 5.04(f)_,
neither SandRidge nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Reorganized
Debtors) shall have any liability or obligation to any Person for any default
under or Cure Costs related to any 365 Contract of any Debtor existing at or
prior to the Closing.



 

52 (d) Crusader agrees to provide to SandRidge a copy of any motion, application
or other court document filed with, and any proposed orders submitted to, the
Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to assume or reject any 365 Contract,
enter into, amend or waive any provision of any Contract, other than as
permitted under  _Section 5.01,_ in advance of filing (with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on same) all of which must be, prior to
filing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to SandRidge in all
material respects.

(e) Each 365 Contract that is assumed by any Debtor in accordance with this
Agreement shall vest in and be fully enforceable by the applicable
Reorganized Debtor in accordance with its terms as of the Closing.

(f) If any 365 Contract listed on  _Schedule 5.04(a)_, other than the 365
Contracts listed on _Schedule 5.04(f)_ (the "Initial Rejected Contracts"), is
(i) not designated by SandRidge as a Desired 365 Contract in accordance with 
_Section 5.04(b)_ or (ii) if any 365 Contract listed on _Schedule 5.04(a)_,
other than Initial Rejected Contracts, is designated as a Desired 365 Contract
and subsequently deemed not to be a Desired 365 Contract as permitted under
_Section 5.04(b)(y)_ (all such 365 Contracts described in clauses (i) and
(ii), collectively, the "No Longer Desired 365 Contracts"), and the aggregate
actual amount to be paid by the Debtors (or the Liquidating Trust) pursuant
to the Plan in respect of the Rejection Amounts related to all No Longer
Desired 365 Contracts exceeds the aggregate Cure Costs that would be payable
if such No Longer Desired 365 Contracts would be assumed by the applicable
Debtors, then the Cash Consideration payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section
2.01(ii)_ shall be increased by the amount that such Rejection Amounts exceed
such Cure Costs.

Section 5.05 _Well Elections_. If any Debtor is provided notice of any
proposed drilling, reworking, recompletion, _sidetracking_ , deepening or
similar activity with respect to any well (other than a Trust Asset), then (i)
if the expenditures with respect to such activity are identified on _Schedule
5.01_, Debtors shall elect to participate in such activity and (ii) if
expenditures with respect to such activity are not identified on _Schedule
5.01_, the Debtors shall provide notice of such proposal, together with
relevant seismic and other data relating to such proposal that is in Debtors
possession, to SandRidge promptly after Debtors receipt of notice of such
proposal. SandRidge shall respond to any such notice provided to SandRidge
promptly after SandRidges receipt of such notice. If SandRidge (A) instructs
Debtors in writing to participate in such activity sufficiently in advance of
the deadline to make an election to participate, Debtors shall elect to
participate in such activity (subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court,
if required) and the expenditures paid by Debtors with respect to such
activity prior to Closing shall be deemed permitted under _Section
5.01(b)(iv)_ for purposes of _Section 2.01(ii)(B)(y)_ and (B) instructs
Debtors in writing not to participate in such activity, or fails to timely
instruct Debtors in writing to participate in such activity, Debtors may, at
Debtors option, elect to participate in such activity but the expenditures
paid by Debtors with respect to such activity shall not be deemed permitted
under _Section 5.01(b)(iv)_ for purposes of _Section 2.01(ii)(B)(y)_ and to
the extent Debtors shall have incurred any obligation in excess of $25,000 in
the aggregate with respect to such activity that shall not have been paid as
of the Closing the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of such
incurred but unpaid obligation.

Section 5.06 _Plan-Related Covenants_.



 

53 (a) Each Debtor agrees that it will not identify any assets as Liquidating
Trust Assets (as defined in the Plan) pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Plan
(or any successor or similar provision) other than the assets set forth on
_Schedule 2.02_ (subject to _Section 2.08_), any Initial Rejected Contract,
any No Longer Desired 365 Contract and any other assets of the Debtors that
SandRidge has requested in writing not vest in the Reorganized Debtors as of
the Closing, except with the consent of SandRidge.

(b) Each Debtor agrees that it will not include on any list of property of the
Estates (as defined in the Plan) to be abandoned pursuant to Section 20.15 of
the Plan any property other than any Trust Assets and any property of the
Debtors that SandRidge has requested in writing not vest in the Reorganized
Debtors as of the Closing, except with the prior written consent
of SandRidge.

Section 5.07 _Assumption of Oil and Gas Leases_. Crusader agrees to: (a) file
with the Bankruptcy Court, by no later than October 2, 2009, a motion for an
order authorizing the Debtors to assume all of their respective Oil and Gas
Leases in the (i) State of Kansas pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and (ii) State of Louisiana solely to the extent Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code is applicable, in each case other than Oil and Gas Leases
listed on _Schedule 2.02_ , which motion must be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to SandRidge, provided that (x) no party admits that
such Oil and Gas Leases are covered by Section 365, and (y) to the extent the
Louisiana Oil and Gas Leases are executory contracts, such assumption pursuant
to _Section 5.07(a)(ii)_ shall be subject to the occurrence of the effective
date of the Plan, and (B) obtain entry of an order granting the motion and
such assumption, if applicable, by October 26, 2009, provided that SandRidge
agrees that such Oil and Gas Leases in this  _Section 5.07_ shall be Vested
Assets (as defined in the Plan) and SandRidge shall not remove such Oil and
Gas Leases from the list of Vested Assets.

Section 5.08 _Termination of Crusader 401(k) Plan_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Crusader agrees to take all actions necessary to terminate its tax-
qualified 401(k) plan, including terminating the trust governing such plan.

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS OF SANDRIDGE

SandRidge agrees that:

Section 6.01 _Conduct of SandRidge_. From the date hereof until the Closing
or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement, SandRidge agrees that it
shall, and that it shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organizations and relationships with Third Parties and to keep available the
services of its present officers and employees. For the avoidance of doubt, it
is consistent with past practice and in the ordinary course of its business
for SandRidge and its Subsidiaries to, from time to time, consider, evaluate
and enter into transactions with Third Parties providing for the purchase or
sale of, or investment in, oil and gas properties and/or related businesses,
which may be structured as a purchase or sale of assets or stock, merger or
other business combination transaction. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing or, if earlier, the
termination of 



 

54  this Agreement, SandRidge shall not, and shall not permit Buyer to amend its
Organizational Documents (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise).

Section 6.02 _Stock Exchange Listing_. SandRidge shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of SandRidge Stock to be issued as
part of the Purchase Consideration and the shares of SandRidge Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Warrants, as applicable, to be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.

Section 6.03 _Health Coverage_. From and after the Closing Date, SandRidge
shall provide coverage under a group health plan sponsored by SandRidge to
(a) any "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in Sections 601, et. seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code, said provisions referred to herein as "COBRA")
with respect to any former employee of Crusader or its Subsidiaries who
experienced a "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) prior to the Closing
Date, for a period of time no less than the period prescribed by COBRA, and
(b) any employee of Crusader or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing Date (or the spouse or any dependent child of such employee) who loses
coverage under a group health plan sponsored by Crusader or SandRidge (or one
of their respective Affiliates) on or within one year after the Closing Date,
for a period of no less than the greater of (i) eighteen months from the date
of loss of coverage, or (ii) the period prescribed by COBRA. SandRidge shall
be responsible for the notices, extension of continuation coverage and other
compliance with COBRA as to any of the persons described in clauses (a) and
(b) of the preceding sentence. In addition, SandRidge shall take such action
as may be necessary so that, on and after the Closing Date, and for one year
thereafter, employees of Crusader or its Subsidiaries who after the Closing
Date are employed by SandRidge or an Affiliate of SandRidge ("Transferred
Employees") are provided health care coverage either, as SandRidge
may determine in its discretion from time to time, (A) pursuant to terms and
conditions of the health care arrangement as in effect and maintained by
Crusader immediately prior to the Closing Date (to the extent SandRidge
decides to maintain such arrangement following the Closing), or (B) pursuant
to a health care plan or program sponsored by SandRidge on substantially the
same basis as employees of SandRidge and its Subsidiaries having similar
responsibilities and positions. The eligibility of any Transferred Employee
to participate in any health care plan or program of SandRidge or its
Subsidiaries shall not be subject to any exclusions for any pre-existing
conditions if such individual met the participation requirements of similar
benefit plans and programs of Crusader and its Subsidiaries. Amounts paid
before the Closing by Transferred Employees under any health plans of Crusader
and its Subsidiaries shall, after the Closing, be taken into account in
applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health
plans of SandRidge and its Subsidiaries provided as of the Closing to the same
extent as if such amounts had been paid under such health plans to SandRidge
and/or its Subsidiaries. 

Section 6.04 _Access_. SandRidge agrees that, following the Closing, and
subject to Applicable Law, the Confidentiality Agreement and except as may be
necessary to protect any applicable legal privilege, it shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Reorganized Debtors, to) give to the
Liquidating Trust and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, books and records relating to the Debtors or
any of their businesses or operations for any and all periods prior to or
including the Closing Date as the Liquidating Trust and its Representatives
may reasonably request and to make copies of the same in connection with (a)
the preparation of Tax returns or information returns, (b) reports or other 



 

55  obligations by the Liquidating Trust or Newco to Governmental Authorities,
(c) with respect to the administration of the Trust Assets or Trust
Liabilities, (d) with respect to the administration of the Bankruptcy Cases,
(e) pursuing, prosecuting, or commencing litigation on account of or relating

shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Reorganized Debtors, to) preserve
all such books and records for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing;
provided, however, that SandRidge shall have the right at any time after the
second anniversary of the Closing Date to request in writing that the
Liquidating Trust (so long as the Liquidating Trust is in existence) take any
such records and, if it does not agree to take such records within ninety (90)
Business Days after receipt of the request, SandRidge (or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) may dispose of such records.

Section 6.05 _Tax Refunds_.

(a) The SandRidge Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim
and prosecute, or to cause the Reorganized Debtors to claim and prosecute, all
properly allowable Tax Refunds of the Debtors for all Crusader Tax Periods
and the portion of any Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the day
before the Allocation Date (determined in accordance with _Section 6.05(b)_).
The SandRidge Parties shall be entitled to reimbursement for all of their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable accountants and
attorneys fees and expenses) relating to claiming and prosecuting such Tax
Refund. All Tax Refunds of the Debtors, including all amounts received by the
SandRidge Parties or any Reorganized Debtor from any Third Party operator on
account of Tax Refunds received by such Third Party with respect to any Vested
Assets (as defined in the Plan), for all Crusader Tax Periods and the portion
of any Straddle Tax Period, in either case ending on and including the day
before the Allocation Date shall be for the account of the Liquidating Trust
and shall be promptly paid to the Liquidating Trust when received by the
SandRidge Parties or any Reorganized Debtor; _provided_ that the SandRidge
Parties will be able to retain any portion or all of any Tax Refund to the
extent they are entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 6.05_ or
_Section 6.06_ or for any Crusader Taxes (other than the Accrued Tax
Liabilities) that SandRidge or any of its Subsidiaries have paid after the
Closing or that SandRidge reasonably believes may be payable by SandRidge or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) For purposes of _Section 6.05(a)_, Tax Refunds of the Debtors for the
portion of any Straddle Tax Period ending on and including the day before the
Allocation Date shall be:

(i) in the case of Tax Refunds attributable to Taxes that are either (A)
based upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with
any production, sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be
allowed as a Tax Refund if the Tax period of the Debtors ended with (and
included) the day before the Allocation Date; provided that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on and including the day before the Allocation Date and the
period beginning on the Allocation Date in proportion to the number of days in
each period; and



 

56 (ii) in the case of Tax Refunds attributable to Taxes that are imposed on
a periodic basis with respect to the assets or capital of the Debtors, deemed
equal to the amount that would be allowed as a Tax Refund for the entire
Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and including the day
before the Allocation Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

Section 6.06 _Tax Returns_.

(a) The SandRidge Parties shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns of the Debtors required to be filed after the Closing Date for all
Crusader Tax Periods and Straddle Tax Periods. The SandRidge Parties shall be
entitled to reimbursement for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable accountants and attorneys fees and expenses) relating
to the preparation of any Tax Returns for any period or portion thereof ending
on the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required
by Applicable Law. In preparing such Tax Returns, the SandRidge Parties shall
seek to minimize Taxes for which the Liquidating Trust may be responsible;
_provided_ that the SandRidge Parties will be under no obligation to apply
for the benefit of the Liquidating Trust any Tax Asset created on or after the
Allocation Date nor to take any position that the SandRidge Parties reasonably
believe is not at least at a "should" level to be sustained on audit unless
the Liquidating Trust delivers an opinion of counsel to the contrary. Nothing
in this provision shall be construed as limiting the obligations of the
Liquidating Trust with respect to Crusader Taxes as set forth in the Plan.
Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax
Return including all applicable extensions, the SandRidge Parties shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation
and workpapers, to the Liquidating Trust for its review and approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Liquidating Trust shall
have 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of such Tax Returns from the
SandRidge Parties to provide the SandRidge Parties with any requested
modifications to such Tax Returns. Further, the SandRidge Parties shall
incorporate any modifications timely requested by the Liquidating Trust if, at
the request of SandRidge, the Liquidating Trust demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the SandRidge Parties that the requested
modifications reflect positions that are at least at a "should" level to be
sustained on audit. The SandRidge Parties will cause such Tax Return to be
timely filed and will provide a copy to the Liquidating Trust. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Liquidating Trust shall not be
responsible for the Accrued Tax Liabilities.

 

(b) The SandRidge Parties shall not amend any Tax Returns of the Debtors that
are attributable to Crusader Tax Periods or Straddle Tax Periods without the
prior written consent of the Liquidating Trust, which consent shall not be
unreasonably denied, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.07 _Disclosure Statement_. SandRidge hereby consents to the
inclusion (or incorporation by reference) of the SandRidge Disclosure
Statement Information in the Disclosure Statement. Prior to the initial
filing of the Disclosure Statement with the Bankruptcy Court, SandRidge shall
obtain (and deliver copies thereof to the Debtors) consent of each of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. and
DeGolyer and 



 

57  MacNaughton to allow the reports of such Persons or references to such
Persons and/or the reports of such Persons included in the SandRidge
Disclosure Statement Information to be included in the Disclosure Statement.

thereof or of any right relating thereto by condemnation, eminent domain or

expanded beyond the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents on the basis of any legal or equitable principle or on any other
basis whatsoever. Neither any equitable or legal principle nor any implied
obligation of good faith or fair dealing nor any other matter requires any
Party to incur, suffer or perform any act, condition or obligation contrary to
the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, whether or
not existing and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable. Each of the Parties
acknowledges that it would be unfair, and that it does not intend, to increase
any of the obligations of the other Party on the basis of any implied
obligation or otherwise.

THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY CRUSADER THAT ARE EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN _ARTICLE III_ OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER DEBTORS NOR ANY OF THEIR

WARRANTY RELATING TO DEBTORS OR THEIR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS OR THE ASSETS, OR
OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS AND, IF MADE, SUCH

TERM LITIGATION DAMAGES, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF

III_ of this Agreement refer to Schedules contained in the Disclosure
Schedule. The information in the Disclosure Schedule constitutes exceptions,
qualifications and/or supplements to particular representations or warranties
of Crusader as set forth in this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedule shall not
