This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 30, 2019 is entered into
by and among Ingersoll-Rand plc, a Republic of Ireland public limited company
("Moon"), Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned Subsidiary of Moon ("SpinCo"), Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Clover"), and Charm Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and
newly formed, wholly owned Subsidiary of Clover ("Merger Sub"). Each of the
foregoing parties is referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties".

  

WHEREAS:

  

(1) SpinCo is a newly formed, wholly owned, indirect Subsidiary of Moon;

  

(2) on or prior to the Distribution Date, and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Moon will
consummate the Reorganization;

  

(3) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Separation
and Distribution Agreement, on the Distribution Date, Moon will either (a)
cause Moon shareholders to receive on a pro rata basis for no consideration
all the shares of SpinCo Common Stock, or (b) consummate an offer to exchange
(the "Exchange Offer") shares of SpinCo Common Stock for outstanding shares of
Moon Common Stock and, in the event that Moon's shareholders subscribe for
less than all of the SpinCo Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, Moon will
distribute, pro rata to its shareholders, any unsubscribed SpinCo Common Stock
on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the
Exchange Offer (the "Clean‑Up Spin‑Off");

  

(4) the disposition by Moon, and receipt by Moon shareholders, of 100% of the
SpinCo Common Stock is referred to as the "Distribution", and the Distribution
together with the Reorganization is referred to as the "Separation";

  

(5) following the Distribution, at the Effective Time, the Parties will effect
the merger of Merger Sub with and into SpinCo, with SpinCo continuing as the
surviving corporation, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

  

(6) the board of directors of Clover (the "Clover Board") (a) has determined
that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best
interests of, Clover and the holders of Clover Common Stock and has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
the Voting Agreement and the issuance of shares of Clover Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger (the "Clover Share Issuance"), and (b) has unanimously
resolved to recommend the approval by the stockholders of Clover of the Clover
Share Issuance;

  

(7) the board of directors of Merger Sub (a) has determined that the Merger
and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (b) has resolved to
recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub;

    

   

(8) the board of directors of SpinCo (the "SpinCo Board") (a) has determined
that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this
Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, the Reorganization and
the Distribution and (b) has resolved to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of SpinCo;

  

(9) the board of directors of Moon (the "Moon Board"), or a duly authorized
committee thereof, has approved this Agreement and the Separation and
Distribution Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, the Reorganization and the Distribution;

  

(10) concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Moon's and SpinCo's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of Clover are entering into a voting agreement
in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to
which such stockholders, among other things, will agree, on the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in such agreements, to vote such
stockholders' shares of Clover Common Stock in favor of the Clover Share
Issuance; and

  

(11) it is the intention of the Parties that, (a) for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes: (i) the Contribution and Distribution qualify as tax‑free under
Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Code; (ii) each of the transactions
described on _Schedule 7.3(b)_ qualify as either a "distribution" under
Section 355 of the Code or as a "reorganization" under Sections 368(a), 361
and 355 of the Code; (iii) the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; (iv) no income, gain or loss be
recognized as a result of such transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) by any of Moon, SpinCo, Clover, their respective Subsidiaries, the
holders of SpinCo Common Stock (except with respect to the receipt of cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Clover Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3_) or
the holders of Moon Common Stock (except with respect to the receipt of cash
in lieu of fractional shares of SpinCo Common Stock, if any); and (v) each of
this Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368‑2(g) and
1.368‑3(a) of the Treasury Regulations; and (b) for Irish tax purposes that
(i) no liability for dividend withholding Tax arises for Moon; (ii) no Tax on
chargeable gains arises for any of Moon, SpinCo, Clover, their respective
Subsidiaries, the holders of SpinCo Common Stock (except with respect to the
receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Clover Common Stock pursuant
to Section 3.3) or the holders of Moon Common Stock (except with respect to
the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of SpinCo Common Stock, if
any); and (iii) no stamp duty arises for any of Moon, SpinCo, Clover or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or shareholders.

any instruments that are treated as stock for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes; and (ii) any stock that may be issued after the Effective Time,
pursuant to the exercise or settlement of an option or other Contract acquired

of the Code with respect thereto, any stock or stock rights granted as
compensation before the Effective Time that is not vested at the Effective
Time; (B) for purposes of clause (ii), any stock that may be issued after the
Effective Time, pursuant to the exercise or settlement of any rights pursuant
to a Clover Stock Plan with respect to which stock Clover demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of Moon and Moon Tax Counsel, in response to Moon Tax
Counsel's requests for relevant information and appropriate representations,
qualifies for Safe Harbor VIII under Treasury Regulation Section 1.355-7(d)

extent that it is reasonably determined by Moon Tax Counsel that issuances of
such stock would not qualify for Safe Harbor VIII under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.355-7(d), determined without regard to any adjustment pursuant to
this _Section 3.1(d)_ , then (w) Moon shall promptly provide notice to Clover
setting forth in detail the reasons the condition set forth in Section
7.3(b)(ii) would be unable to be satisfied, (x) Moon shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by Clover, (y) the aggregate number of shares of
Clover Common Stock into which the shares of SpinCo Common Stock are converted

Stock with respect to Qualified SpinCo Common Stock equals the Threshold
Percentage, if and to the extent necessary after considering Clover's comments
pursuant to clause (x) of this _Section 3.1(d)_ , and (z) except if the
condition set forth in _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ would be unable to be satisfied as
a result of (1) a breach by Clover of its obligations under this Agreement, or
(2) solely any actions taken by Clover or any of its Subsidiaries after the
signing hereof pursuant to a plan (or series of related transactions) that
includes the Distribution (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)
other than the Merger, the SpinCo Payment shall be decreased by an amount
equal to the product of (1) an amount equal to the closing price per share of
Clover Common Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the Distribution,
multiplied by (2) the number of additional shares of Clover Common Stock
required to be issued pursuant to the true-up set forth in clause (y) of this
_Section 3.1(d)_.

cash in lieu of any fractional share of Clover Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(c)_). The Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of

hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto for the account of the
Persons entitled thereto.

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares_

  

No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Clover
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid or
otherwise delivered to the former holders of SpinCo Common Stock with respect
to any shares of Clover Common Stock that are not able to be distributed by
the Agent to such holder promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a
legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such previously
undistributed shares of Clover Common Stock, there shall be paid to the record
holder of such shares of Clover Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the
time of the distribution, to the extent not previously paid, the amount of
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Clover Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_ and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Clover Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the
distribution of such shares of Clover Common Stock and a payment date
subsequent to the distribution of such shares of Clover Common Stock payable
with respect to such whole shares of Clover Common Stock. Clover shall deposit
in the Distribution Fund all such dividends and distributions.

  

  

 

24  

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in SpinCo Common Stock_

  

All shares of Clover Common Stock issued in respect of shares of SpinCo Common
Stock (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.3_) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of SpinCo Common Stock.

  

(e) _Termination of Distribution Fund_

  

Any portion of the Distribution Fund made available to the Agent that remains
undistributed to the former holders of SpinCo Common Stock on the one‑year
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Clover, and any former
holders of SpinCo Common Stock who as of such time have not received shares of
Clover Common Stock in accordance with this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to Clover for payment of their claim for shares of Clover Common
Stock and any dividends, distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares
with respect to Clover Common Stock (subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law).

  

(f) _No Liability_

  

Neither Moon, the Surviving Corporation, Clover, Merger Sub, the Agent nor any
other Person shall be liable to any holder of SpinCo Common Stock or any
holder of Moon Common Stock for shares of Clover Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto or with respect to SpinCo Common Stock) or
cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(g) _Closing of Transfer Books_

  

From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of SpinCo shall be
closed and no transfer shall be made of any shares of capital stock of SpinCo
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(h) _Tax Withholding_

  

Clover, the Surviving Corporation or the Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the consideration or
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of SpinCo
Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the recipient.

  

(i) _No Appraisal Rights_

  

In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of SpinCo Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

  

SECTION 3.3. _Fractional Shares_

  

  

 

25  

  

(a) No fractional shares of Clover Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of SpinCo Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Clover Common Stock shall, in lieu of such
fraction of a share, be entitled to receive, from the Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 3.3_, a cash payment representing such
holder's proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the
Agent (reduced by any fees of the Agent attributable to such sale) in one or
more transactions of shares of Clover Common Stock equal to the excess of (i)
the aggregate number of shares of Clover Common Stock to be delivered to the
Agent by Clover pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Clover Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of shares
of SpinCo Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ (such excess, the "Excess
Shares"). Moon, SpinCo, Clover and Merger Sub acknowledge that payment of the
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Clover Common Stock
was not separately bargained‑for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Clover that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares
of Clover Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Agent, as agent for the holders of SpinCo Common Stock that would otherwise
receive fractional shares of Clover Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares
at then prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in the following
paragraph.

  

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Agent, as agent for the holders of
SpinCo Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Clover
Common Stock, shall be executed on the NYSE and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the holders of SpinCo Common Stock, the Agent shall hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of SpinCo Common Stock that would
otherwise receive fractional shares of Clover Common Stock (the "Common Shares
Trust"). The Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to
which each holder of SpinCo Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares
Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such holder of SpinCo Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all holders of SpinCo Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled.

  

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of SpinCo Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
shares of Clover Common Stock, the Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of shares of SpinCo Common Stock, without interest, subject to
and in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

  

SECTION 3.4. _Moon Equity Awards_

  

Each Moon Equity Award held by a SpinCo Employee as of the Effective Time
shall be treated as set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.

  

  

 

26

applicable, the Schedule TO. When delivered pursuant to Section 7.17, the Rule
3-05 Audited Financial Statements and the Rule 3-05 Interim Financial
Statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, and shall present fairly in all material respects the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Rule 3-05 Business as at
the dates and for the periods presented (subject to year-end adjustments, in
the case of the Rule 3-05 Financial Statements relating to any interim
periods) and shall have been prepared in conformity in all material respects
to the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to the annual and
quarterly, as applicable, financial statements of the Rule 3-05 Business
required to be included in the SpinCo Registration Statement. The Rule 3-05
Financial Statements and the Rule 3-05 Interim Financial Statements are the
only financial statements required by Moon or its Subsidiaries to be included
in the Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 3-05 or Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X
promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act.

  

(c) As of the date hereof, no SpinCo Entity is required to file any form,
report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC.

  

(d) Moon maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act with respect to the SpinCo Business. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Moon is reported on a timely basis to
the individuals responsible for the preparation of Moon's

  

  

 

34  

  

filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Moon's management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Moon's internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such
assessment concluded that such internal control system was effective. Moon's
independent registered public accountant has issued (and not subsequently
withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that Moon maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
Moon's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act) is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that are in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Moon, (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of Moon are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of Moon and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Moon's assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements.

  

(e) Moon has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls prior to the date hereof, to Moon's auditors and audit committee (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Moon's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information with respect to the SpinCo Business and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management other employees who
have a significant role in Moon's internal control over financial reporting
with respect to the SpinCo Business.

other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such businesses
consistent with past practice.

  

(b) Since December 31, 2018, there has not been any change, event, occurrence,
state of facts, condition, circumstance or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate with such other changes, events, occurrences, state of facts,
conditions, circumstances or effects, has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect or have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Moon and the SpinCo Entities to perform their
respective obligations hereunder or under the Transaction Documents or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, taken as a whole.

  

SECTION 5.7. _Litigation and Liabilities_.

  

(a) There are no Actions pending or, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge,
threatened against Moon or its Subsidiaries (including any SpinCo Entity)

reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect or have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Moon and the SpinCo Entities to
perform their respective obligations hereunder or under the Transaction
Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
taken as a whole. No SpinCo Entity is a party to or subject to the provisions
of any Governmental Order that restricts in any material respect the manner in
which the SpinCo Entities conduct the SpinCo Business, that otherwise is
material to the SpinCo Business or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse
Effect or have a material adverse effect on the ability of Moon and the SpinCo
Entities to perform their respective obligations hereunder or under the
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, taken as a whole.

  

(b) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the SpinCo Balance Sheet
(as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement) (including the
related notes and schedules) prior to the date hereof, (ii) for obligations or
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with Moon's
past practice since the date of such consolidated balance sheet, (iii)
liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, (iv) Liabilities that would be Excluded Liabilities
pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement or (v) liabilities and
obligations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect, no SpinCo Entity has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
matured, unmatured, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet of Moon or SpinCo.

  

SECTION 5.8. _Compliance with Laws; Licenses; Anti-Corruption Laws; Import and
Export Laws_.

  

(a) Since the Applicable Date the SpinCo Business has not been, and the SpinCo
Business is not being, conducted in violation of any Laws, Permits or any
Privacy Policies, in each case, except for violations that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to
result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect
on the ability of Moon and the SpinCo Entities to perform their respective
obligations hereunder or under the Transaction Documents or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, taken as a whole.

  

(b) Each SpinCo Entity and with respect to the SpinCo Business, each Moon
Entity has obtained and is in compliance with all Permits necessary to conduct
the SpinCo Business as presently conducted (the "SpinCo Licenses"), except
those the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, have not
resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material
Adverse Effect. The operation of the SpinCo Business as presently conducted is
not, and has not been since the Applicable Date, in violation of, nor is any
SpinCo Entity or any Moon Entity in default or violation under, any SpinCo
License, and, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge, no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation of any material term, condition or provision of any SpinCo License,
except where such default or violation of such SpinCo License, individually or
in the aggregate, has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to
result in a SpinCo

  

  

 

36  

  

Material Adverse Effect. There are no Actions pending or, to Moon's or
SpinCo's Knowledge, threatened, that seek the revocation, cancellation or
adverse modification of any SpinCo License, except where such revocation,
cancellation or adverse modification would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse
Effect. Since the Applicable Date, neither Moon nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice or communication of any noncompliance or alleged
noncompliance with any SpinCo Licenses, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material
Adverse Effect.

  

(c) Since the Applicable Date, (i) no SpinCo Entity or, to Moon's or SpinCo's

Business (including a Moon Entity), including any officer, director, employee,
agent and Affiliate thereof has granted, paid, offered or promised to grant,
pay, or authorized or ratified the granting of payment, directly or
indirectly, of any rebates, monies or anything of value to any Government
Official or any political party or candidate for political office, or to any
other Person under circumstances where any SpinCo Entity, or any Person

Business, including any officer, director, employee, agent and Affiliate
thereof, knew or had reason to know that all or a portion of such rebates,
monies or things of value would be offered, promised, or given, directly or
indirectly, to any Government Official, for the purpose of (A) influencing any
act or decision of such Government Official in his or her official capacity;
(B) inducing such Government Official to do, or omit to do, any act in
relation to his or her lawful duty; (C) securing any improper advantage or (D)

Affiliate thereof, in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or
directing business to, any Person or to secure any other improper benefit or
advantage, (ii) each SpinCo Entity and, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge, each
Person associated with or acting on behalf of a SpinCo Entity or the SpinCo

SpinCo Business, the Moon Entities have at all times conducted their export
and import and related transactions in material compliance with all applicable
Import and Export Laws.

the SpinCo Business, any Moon Entity has engaged in, nor is now knowingly
engaging in, any unlawful dealings or transactions with (i) any Person that at
the time of the dealing or transaction is or was the subject or the target of
sanctions administered by United States Department of the Treasury's Office of
Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") or (ii) any Person in Cuba, Iran, Syria, North
Korea or the Crimea region of Ukraine.

  

  

 

37  

  

(f) Without limiting the foregoing subsections (d) and (e) directly above,
there have been no Actions, there are no pending Actions and, to Moon's or
SpinCo's Knowledge, there are no threatened Actions, by any Governmental
Authority of potential violations with respect to compliance with Import and
Export Laws against any SpinCo Entity or, with respect to the SpinCo Business,
any Moon Entity.

Each such Contract described in subsections _(i)_ through _(x)_ of this
_Section 5.9(a)_ and each Contract set forth in _Section 5.9_ of the SpinCo
Disclosure Letter is referred to herein as a "SpinCo Material Contract."

  

(b) A complete and correct copy of each SpinCo Material Contract has been made
available to Clover in an electronic data room prior to the date hereof. Each
of the SpinCo Material Contracts is valid and binding on the SpinCo Entity or
SpinCo Entities (as applicable) and, to Moon's and SpinCo's Knowledge, each
other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except for such failures
to be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect as would not, or
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect. There exists no breach or event of
default with respect to any SpinCo Material Contracts on the part of any
SpinCo Entity or, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge, any other party thereto,
and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice
or both would constitute a breach or default thereunder by any SpinCo Entity
or, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge, any other party thereto, except in each
case, for such invalidity, failure to be binding, unenforceability,
ineffectiveness, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse
Effect.

  

SECTION 5.10. _Real Property_.

  

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect, (i) SpinCo or one of
the SpinCo Subsidiaries, as applicable, has good and marketable title to the
SpinCo Owned Real Property, free and clear of any Lien other than Permitted
Liens, and (ii) there are no outstanding options or

  

  

 

39  

  

rights of first refusal to purchase the SpinCo Owned Real Property, or any
portion of the SpinCo Owned Real Property or interest therein. There are no
parties other than the SpinCo Entities in possession of the SpinCo Owned Real
Property (other than the Moon Entities). The SpinCo Owned Real Property and
all buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures located on the SpinCo
Owned Real Property have been maintained in accordance with normal industry
practice, are in good operating condition and repair, and are suitable for the
purposes for which they are currently used, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material
Adverse Effect.

  

(b) With respect to the SpinCo Leased Real Property, the agreements for such
property are valid, legally binding, enforceable and in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms, and no SpinCo Entity, or to the Knowledge of
SpinCo, any third party is in breach of or default under such agreement, and
no event has occurred which, with notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default by any SpinCo Entity, or to the Knowledge of
Moon, any third party or permit termination, modification or acceleration by
any third party thereunder, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse
Effect or have a material adverse effect on the ability of Moon and the SpinCo
Entities to perform their respective obligations hereunder or under the
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, taken as a whole. The SpinCo Leased Real Property and all buildings,
structures, improvements, and fixtures located on the SpinCo Leased Real
Property are suitable for the purposes for which they are currently used,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect. There are no Contracts or
written or oral concessions granting to any Person other than a SpinCo Entity
the right to use or occupy any material SpinCo Leased Real Property.

  

(c) No SpinCo Entity has received any notice of any pending or threatened
condemnation of any SpinCo Owned Real Property or any SpinCo Leased Real
Property by any Governmental Authority, nor, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge,
are there any public improvements or re-zoning measures proposed or in
progress that would reasonably be expected to result in a SpinCo Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) With respect to each material Benefit Plan, SpinCo will make available to
Clover, to the extent applicable, within sixty (60) days following the date

agreement for identifying SpinCo Employees as set forth on Schedule 3.01(a) of
the Employee Matters Agreement) complete and correct copies of (i) the Benefit
Plan document, including any amendments or supplements thereto, and all

the Code, has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code and, to Moon's or SpinCo's Knowledge, nothing has occurred that
would adversely affect the qualification or tax exemption of any such Benefit
Plan. With respect to any ERISA Plan, no SpinCo Entity has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which any SpinCo Entity reasonably would be
subject to either a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by either Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

of corporations" (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), is under "common
control" (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code), or is a member of the
same "affiliated service group" (as defined under Section 414(m) of the Code

under Section 414(b), (c), or (m) of the Code (a "Multiple Employer Plan").

  

(g) With respect to any ERISA Plan subject to the minimum funding requirements
of Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (i) no such plan is, or is

Benefit Guaranty Corporation, (vi) except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the SpinCo Business, taken as a whole, no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for
which the thirty day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations
to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event described in
Sections 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred and (vii) neither SpinCo nor

to any Person, and no SpinCo Entity has any obligation to provide such
benefits.

  

(i) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) is in documentary compliance
with, and has been operated and administered in material compliance with,
Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS provided
thereunder.

  

(j) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement,

Documents could, either alone or in combination with another event, result in
the payment of any amount to any current or former employee, director, officer
or independent contract of any SpinCo Entity that could, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

  

(l) No SpinCo Entity has any obligation to provide, and no Benefit Plan or
other agreement provides any current or former employee, director, officer or

thereto (other than Clover). As of the date of this Agreement, no event has

constitute a default or breach on the part of SpinCo under any term or
condition of the SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,
SpinCo has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing to
be satisfied by it will not be satisfied on a timely basis.

SECTION 6.5. _Clover Reports; Financial Statements_.

  

(a) Clover has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act since May 12, 2017 (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and
other documents filed or furnished to the SEC since May 12, 2017 and those
filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof, including any
amendments thereto, the "Clover Reports"). Each of the Clover Reports, at the
time of its filing or being furnished to the SEC complied or, if not yet filed
or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") applicable to the Clover Reports. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the
date of such amendment), the Clover Reports did not, and any Clover Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Since January 1, 2019, neither Clover nor any of its Subsidiaries
has consummated any unregistered offering of securities that by the terms of
such offering requires subsequent registration under the Securities Act. None
of the Subsidiaries of Clover are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  

(b) Clover is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or the
rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither
Clover nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or

  

  

 

53  

  

modified (in any material respect) any extensions of credit in the form of a
personal loan to any executive officer or director of Clover.

  

(c) Clover maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed by Clover is reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of Clover's filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Clover's management has completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of Clover's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that
such internal control system was effective. Clover's independent registered
public accountant has issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an
attestation report concluding that Clover maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Clover's internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act) is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that are in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Clover, (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of Clover are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of Clover and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Clover's assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements.

  

(d) Clover has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation by its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof, to
Clover's auditors and the audit committee of the Clover Board (i) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Clover's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Clover's
internal control over financial reporting.

  

(e) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Clover Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, the consolidated financial position of Clover and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Clover Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated
results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of such companies for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted therein).

  

SECTION 6.6. _Absence of Certain Changes_.

  

  

 

54  

  

(a) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, since December 31, 2018, Clover and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of such
businesses consistent with past practice.

  

(b) Since December 31, 2018, there has not been any change, event, occurrence,
state of facts, condition, circumstance or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate with such other changes, events, occurrences, states of facts,
conditions, circumstances or effects, has resulted in or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Clover Material Adverse Effect or have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Clover to perform its obligations hereunder
or under the Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, taken as a whole.

  

SECTION 6.7. _Litigation and Liabilities_.

  

(a) There are no Actions pending or, to Clover's Knowledge, threatened against
Clover or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Clover
Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Clover to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Transaction Documents
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, taken as a
whole. Neither Clover nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to
the provisions of any Governmental Order that restricts in any material
respect the manner in which Clover and its Subsidiaries conduct their
businesses, that otherwise is material to Clover and its Subsidiaries or that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Clover Material Adverse Effect or have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Clover to perform its obligations hereunder or under the
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, taken as a whole.

  

(b) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in Clover's most recent
consolidated balance sheet (including the related notes and schedules)
included in the Clover Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) for
obligations or liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the date of such consolidated balance
sheet, (iii) liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby; or (iv) liabilities and obligations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Clover
Material Adverse Effect, neither Clover nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, matured,
unmatured, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of Clover.

  

SECTION 6.8. _Compliance with Laws; Licenses; Anti-Corruption Laws; Import and
Export Laws._

  

(a) Since the Applicable Date, the businesses of Clover and its Subsidiaries
have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any Laws, Permits
or any Privacy Policies, in each case, except for violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted and would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Clover Material Adverse Effect or have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Clover to perform its obligations hereunder

55  

  

under the Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, taken as a whole.

  

(b) Each of Clover and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance with
all Permits necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted (the

or violation under, any Clover License, and, to Clover's Knowledge, no event

expected to result in a Clover Material Adverse Effect. There are no Actions
pending or, to Clover's Knowledge, threatened, that seek the revocation,
cancellation or adverse modification of any Clover License, except where such
revocation, cancellation or adverse modification would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Clover Material Adverse
Effect. Since the Applicable Date, neither Clover nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice or communication of any noncompliance or alleged
noncompliance with any Clover Licenses, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Clover Material
Adverse Effect.

legal, valid and binding obligation of Clover and, to the Knowledge of Clover,
the other parties thereto (other than SpinCo). As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred and on the Closing Date, no event shall have
occurred and be continuing, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Clover under any
term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letter. Clover has fully paid
any and all commitment fees, any other fees or any other amounts required by
the Financing Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement and Clover represents that it shall fully pay or cause to be paid

SECTION 7.3. _Tax Matters_

  

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 1.368‑2(g) of the Treasury Regulations and the Parties
hereby adopt it as such. From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the Effective Time, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
the Tax‑Free Status of the External Transactions and shall not knowingly take
any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Tax‑Free Status of the External Transactions. Following the
Effective Time, none of Moon, Clover or any of their Affiliates shall
knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could prevent the Tax‑Free Status of the External Transactions.

  

(b) Clover and Moon shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts in order for:

  

(i) Clover to obtain the opinion of Clover Tax Counsel, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Clover, dated as of the Closing Date, on the basis of
the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred
to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters to the effect that, for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and no
income, gain or loss will be recognized by any of Clover, Merger Sub, SpinCo
or the holders of SpinCo Common Stock as a result of the Merger (except with
respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Clover Common
Stock) (such opinion of such Clover Tax Counsel, the "Clover Tax Opinion");
and

  

(ii) Moon to obtain the opinion of Moon Tax Counsel, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Moon, dated as of the Closing Date, on the basis of
the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred
to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, (I) as to the Tax-Free
Status of the External Transactions; (II) that, for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, each of the transactions described on _Schedule 7.3(b)_ will qualify
as either a "distribution" under Section 355 of the Code or as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a), including by way of Sections 361 and
355 of the Code, as applicable, and no income, gain or loss will be recognized
by the parties thereto (as determined for U.S. federal income Tax purposes)
that is subject to U.S. federal income Tax; and (III) covering any other
matters reasonably requested by Moon with respect to the Tax treatment of
material transactions undertaken pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization (such
opinion of Moon Tax Counsel, the "Moon Tax Opinion"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no additional opinion described in clause (III) of the previous
sentence shall be a condition to Closing, and to the extent that Moon receives
the ruling described in Section 2.1(d) of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement, the opinion of Moon Tax Counsel as it relates to clause (b) of the
definition of Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions shall be waived by
Moon, or Moon Tax Counsel shall provide such opinion on the basis of such
ruling.

  

(c) As a condition precedent to the rendering of the Moon Tax Opinion and the
Clover Tax Opinion, Clover, Moon and SpinCo, and others, if required, shall,
as of the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Moon Tax Counsel and Clover Tax
Counsel the Tax

  

  

 

75  

  

Representation Letters. In addition, Clover, Moon and SpinCo, and others, if
required, shall, as of the date for filing the Clover Registration Statement
(or such other date(s) as determined necessary by counsel in connection with
the filing of the Clover Registration Statement or its exhibits), execute and
deliver to Moon Tax Counsel and Clover Tax Counsel the Tax Representation
Letters, dated and executed as of the applicable filing date.

  

SECTION 7.4. _Preparation of the Registration Statements, Proxy Statement and
Schedule TO; Clover Stockholders Meeting_

  

(a) _Registration Statements; Proxy Statement; Schedule TO_. As promptly as
practicable after the delivery by Moon of the Audited Financial Statements,
any applicable Interim Financial Statements, the Rule 3-05 Audited Financial
Statements, and any applicable Rule 3-05 Interim Financial Statements pursuant
to _Section 7.17_, to the extent such filings are required by Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (i) Clover,
Moon and SpinCo shall jointly prepare and Clover shall file with the SEC, the
Proxy Statement to be sent to the holders of Clover Common Stock relating to
the Clover Stockholders Meeting and the Clover Registration Statement, in
which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with
the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Clover Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger; (ii) Clover, Moon and SpinCo shall jointly prepare
and Moon shall file with the SEC the SpinCo Registration Statement; and (iii)
if the Distribution is effected in whole or in part as an exchange offer, Moon
shall prepare and file with the SEC, when and as required, a Schedule TO and
other filings pursuant to Rule 13e‑4 under the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Schedule TO"). The Clover Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the
SpinCo Registration Statement and the Schedule TO shall comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

  

(b) Each of Clover, Moon and SpinCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Clover Registration Statement and the SpinCo Registration Statement
(together, the "Registration Statements") declared effective as promptly as
practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC)
and, prior to the effective date of the Clover Registration Statement and the
SpinCo Registration Statement, each of Clover, Moon and SpinCo shall take all
action reasonably required (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent
to service of process in any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any
applicable securities Laws in connection with, in the case of Clover, the
issuance of Clover Common Stock and, in the case of Moon and SpinCo, the
Distribution. As promptly as practicable after the SpinCo Registration
Statement shall have become effective, Moon shall cause the Distribution
Documents to be mailed to holders of Moon Common Stock. As promptly as
practicable after the Clover Registration Statement shall have become
effective, Clover shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Clover's
stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Clover
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will be made by Clover without
providing Moon and SpinCo with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon (and such comments shall be reasonably considered by Clover). No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the SpinCo Registration Statement or
the Schedule TO, if applicable, will be made by Moon or SpinCo without
providing Clover with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(and such comments shall be reasonably considered by Moon).

  

  

 

76  

  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Clover, Moon or SpinCo, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by Clover, Moon or SpinCo to be required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Clover Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement, the SpinCo Registration Statement or the Schedule TO, so that
any such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly prepared by the Parties and filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Clover. Each Party shall
notify the other Party promptly of the time when the Clover Registration
Statement or the SpinCo Registration Statement has become effective, and of
the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
shares of Clover Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger or shares
of SpinCo Common Stock issuable in the Distribution for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. In addition, each Party agrees to provide the other Parties
and their respective counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform the other Party of any oral comments, that such Party or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Clover Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement, the SpinCo Registration
Statement or the Schedule TO promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Each Party and its respective counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and
each Party shall give due consideration to the additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the other Parties and their respective counsel.

  

(d) In connection with the filing of the Registration Statements and other SEC
filings contemplated hereby, Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with Clover to prepare pro forma financial statements that comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC to the extent required for SEC
filings, including the requirements of Regulation S-X; and (ii) provide and
make reasonably available upon reasonable notice the senior management
employees of Moon to discuss the materials prepared and delivered pursuant to
this _Section 7.4(d)_.

  

(e) Moon and SpinCo agree to promptly provide Clover with the information
concerning Moon and SpinCo and their respective Affiliates required to be
included in the Proxy Statement and the Clover Registration Statement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Moon and SpinCo shall use all reasonable best
efforts to, or shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, furnish promptly to Clover such additional financial and
operating data and other information, as to the SpinCo Business as Clover may
require in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the
Clover Registration Statement.

  

(f) Clover agrees to promptly provide Moon and SpinCo with the information
concerning Clover and its Affiliates required to be included in the SpinCo
Registration Statement and the Schedule TO. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Clover shall use all reasonable best efforts to, or shall use all reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, furnish promptly to Moon and
SpinCo such additional financial and operating data and other information, as
to it and its Subsidiaries' businesses as Moon and SpinCo may require in
connection with the preparation of the SpinCo Registration Statement and the
Schedule TO.

  

  

 

77  

  

(g)

  

(i) Clover shall establish a record date for, and, as soon as practicable
following the effectiveness of the Clover Registration Statement, duly call
and give notice of and convene and, as soon as practicable thereafter, hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Clover Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of seeking the Clover Stockholder Approval. Clover shall not postpone,
delay or adjourn, or change the record date with respect to, the Clover
Stockholders Meeting, without the prior written consent of Moon (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Clover may, after consultation with Moon, and, in the case of
clause (A) below upon the reasonable request of Moon shall, adjourn the Clover
Stockholders Meeting (A) for a period reasonably necessary to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent the
requisite Clover Stockholder Approval would not otherwise be obtained, (B) for
a period reasonably necessary if a quorum has not been established, (C) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Clover Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Clover stockholders prior to the Clover
Stockholders Meeting; or (D) for a period reasonably necessary if required by
Law.

  

(ii) Unless the Clover Board shall have effected a Clover Change of
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 7.10_ , Clover shall, through the
Clover Board, make the Clover Recommendation and include such Clover
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to
(A) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Clover Stockholder
Approval, and (B) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the
Clover Stockholder Approval.

  

(iii) Notwithstanding any Clover Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Clover Share Issuance shall be submitted to the
stockholders of Clover for approval at the Clover Stockholders Meeting whether
or not (x) the Clover Board shall have effected a Clover Change of
Recommendation or (y) any Competing Proposal shall have been publicly proposed
or announced or otherwise submitted to Clover or any of its Representatives.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Clover
shall not be required to hold the Clover Stockholders Meeting if this
Agreement is validly terminated.

  

SECTION 7.5. _Listing_

  

As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Clover shall make
application to the NYSE for the listing of the shares of Clover Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

  

SECTION 7.6. _Reasonable Best Efforts_

  

  

 

78  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

license, order, waiting period expiration, approval, permit, exemption, or
clearance from any third party, which are necessary or advisable to be
obtained in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as
required under the HSR Act and under the Competition Laws of the jurisdictions
set forth in _Schedule 7.6(a)_ ) (collectively, the "Approvals"); and (iv)
using reasonable best efforts not to take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a material delay in
obtaining, or in not obtaining, any Approvals.

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties agree

20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, to prepare and submit

relating to the Merger; and (iv) as promptly as practicable following the
receipt thereof, respond to (or properly reduce the scope of) any formal or
informal request for additional information or documentary material received
by either Party from any Governmental Authority.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Clover and
Moon shall jointly determine the strategy to be pursued for obtaining all
Approvals and clearances (other than any strategy related to Remedial Actions)
under any Competition Law, including with respect to any filings,
notifications, submissions, and communications made in connection with the
obtaining of the required Approvals or clearance under any Competition Law;
provided that, Clover shall (subject to Section 7.6(d) below) determine, after
consultation with and taking into account in good faith any suggestions of
Moon with respect thereto, the strategy to be pursued with respect to whether
and to what extent to offer, or agree to sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of, hold separate, or place any restrictions on the
operation of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses, or interests therein of Clover or SpinCo (a " _Remedial Action_
"); _provided_ that the Parties shall act reasonably promptly and cooperate in
connection herewith in a manner designed to cause the Closing not to occur
materially later than the date the Closing would otherwise have occurred if it
had not been necessary to obtain Approvals and clearances under Competition
Laws.

  

(d) Without limiting this _Section 7.6_ , but subject to the next sentence of
this _Section 7.6(d)_ , each Party will take, or to cause to be taken, any and
all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under the HSR

  

  

 

79  

  

Act or any other Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of SpinCo
(or the SpinCo Subsidiaries) or Clover (or the Clover Subsidiaries), as
applicable, or otherwise taking or committing to take action that limits
SpinCo's or the SpinCo Subsidiaries' or Clover's or the Clover Subsidiaries',
as applicable, freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain,
any of the businesses, product lines or assets of SpinCo (or the SpinCo
Subsidiaries) or Clover (or the Clover Subsidiaries) in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , (A) Moon shall not take or agree to any of the
foregoing actions in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section
7.6(d)_ without the prior written consent of Clover and (B) that the Parties
shall not be required to take and shall not take or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section
7.6(d)_ that require sales, divestitures, dispositions, licenses or other
Remedial Action in respect of any assets or businesses of Clover (or the
Clover Subsidiaries) or SpinCo (or the SpinCo Subsidiaries) (x) that, in the
aggregate in the United States account for more than $200 million of revenue
generated during the 12-month period ended December, 31, 2019 or (y) that, in
the aggregate in all jurisdictions including outside of the United States,
account for more than $400 million of revenue generated during the 12-month
period ended December 31, 2019; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
effectiveness of any such sale, divestiture or disposition License or other
Remedial Action or commitment shall be conditioned upon the Closing occurring.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require Moon to
agree to any sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or
businesses, or restriction or change in the ownership, conduct or operations
of any assets or businesses, in each case, that are not included in the SpinCo
Business.

  

(e) The Parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to this _Section 7.6_, including in the
preparation and making of filings contemplated by _Section 7.6(b)_. Moon shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Clover all necessary information
and assistance as Clover may reasonably require in responding to any
Governmental Authority's request for additional information or in connection
with any other investigation or inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a third party. Each Party shall keep the other Party and its counsel
reasonably informed of any communication received by such Party from, or given
by such Party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby (and in each case, if any such
communication is in writing, share a copy with the other Party). Each Party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with the
DOJ, the FTC, or any other Governmental Authority, and to the extent permitted
by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other
Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences. The parties may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 7.6(e)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the

  

  

 

80  

  

outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or
its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
7.6(e)_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section 7.6(e)_ may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning valuation; (ii) to the extent necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements; and (iii) to the extent necessary to
address reasonable privilege and confidentiality concerns.

  

(f) Neither Clover nor Moon shall enter into any transaction or any agreement
to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially and adversely affect
such Party's ability to (i) obtain the timely expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals required under any other Competition Law applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Government Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 7.7. _Financing_

  

(a) Clover shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the
Closing (i) the Financing on the terms and conditions (including any "market
flex" provisions included in any related flex letter) set forth in the
executed commitment letter (including: (A) all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments to such agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement;
(B) any associated flex letter (together, the "SpinCo Financing Commitment
Letter"); (C) any associated fee letter; and (D) any other associated side
letter or other agreement or arrangement containing conditions to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing (together with the SpinCo Financing
Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment Letter")) from Citi, KKR Capital
Markets LLC, KKR Corporate Lending LLC and Goldman Sachs Bank USA (together
with all additional lenders and financing sources added to the SpinCo
Financing Commitment Letter or Financing Commitment Letter, the "Lenders"),
pursuant to which, among other things, the Lenders have committed to provide
SpinCo with debt financing with net proceeds of $1,900,000,000 for the purpose
of making the SpinCo Payment (as defined in the Separation and Distribution
Agreement) (the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment
Letter, being referred to as the "Financing") or on such other terms that
would not be prohibited by _Section 7.7(b)_ or (ii) in the event all or any
portion of the Financing pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letter becomes
unavailable, the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Alternative Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions
included in any flex letter relating thereto) or on such other terms as would
not be prohibited by _Section 7.7(b)_. Clover shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain the Financing
Commitment Letter in effect until the earlier of the initial funding of the
Financing or the effectiveness of the Financing Agreements, (B) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing, on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" provisions included in any related flex letter) or on such other terms
that would not be prohibited by _Section 7.7(b)_ (the "Financing Agreements")
and shall deliver to SpinCo a copy thereof as promptly as practicable (and no
later than one (1) Business Day after such execution), and upon

  

  

 

81  

  

the effectiveness thereof, maintain the Financing Agreements in effect until
the initial funding of the Financing, (C) comply with the obligations that are
set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter that are applicable to Clover or
any Subsidiary of Clover and satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within its control,
(D) fully enforce the rights of Clover under the Financing Commitment Letter
and the Financing Agreements, and (E) use reasonable best efforts to arrange
for the Financing to be available for SpinCo to draw upon and consummate at or
prior to the Distribution. In the event the Financing in the amounts set forth
in the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, or any portion
thereof, becomes unavailable, or it becomes reasonably likely that it may
become unavailable, on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions included in any
related flex letter) or the Financing Agreements, Clover shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly
alternative financing, from the same or alternative financing sources, in an
amount sufficient to make the SpinCo Payment, and which Alternative Financing
shall not contain conditions precedent to the funding thereof that are less
favorable to Clover or SpinCo than the conditions precedent with respect to
the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letter and to obtain, and,
when obtained, to provide promptly to SpinCo a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative
Commitment Letter") and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (the "Alternative
Financing Agreements"); _provided_ that the terms of any Alternative Financing
must be consistent with the Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions, as
reasonably determined by Moon and SpinCo. In the event any Alternative
Financing is obtained, any reference in this Agreement to "Financing" shall
include such Alternative Financing, any reference to "Financing Commitment
Letter" shall include the Alternative Commitment Letter with respect to such
Alternative Financing, any reference to "Lenders" shall include the financial
institutions providing such Alternative Financing, and any reference to
"Financing Agreements" shall include any definitive agreements with respect to
such Alternative Commitment Letter, and all obligations of each Party pursuant
to this _Section 7.7_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as such
Party's obligations, as the case may be, with respect to the Financing. Clover
shall promptly pay all commitment, engagement or arrangement fees, ticking
fees, structuring fees, upfront fees or similar fees and expenses associated
with the Financing (including as a result of the exercise of any "market flex"
provisions in any flex letter by the Lenders) (the "Commitment Fee Expenses")
which Commitment Fee Expenses may not be netted from the proceeds of the
Financing, except to the extent the amount of the Financing is increased to
fund flex OID as contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter.

  

(b)

  

(i) Without limitation of the obligations of Clover under this Agreement,
Clover shall give SpinCo prompt written notice if Clover becomes aware of (w)
any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the
Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements; (x) any actual or
threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of
the Lenders; (y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of
the parties to the Financing Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements
relating to, or otherwise potentially affecting,

  

  

 

82  

  

the amount or the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date or
satisfaction of the conditions thereunder; and (z) any amendment or
modification of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements. Clover shall give SpinCo prompt written notice if Clover
believes in good faith that Clover will not be able to timely arrange for
SpinCo to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letter or
the Financing Agreements. Clover shall keep SpinCo informed in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing, including by
providing copies of then-current drafts of the Financing Agreements and
providing copies of all definitive Financing Agreements, in each case, upon
request. Clover shall not, without the prior written consent of SpinCo, amend,
modify, supplement, restate, substitute, replace, terminate, or agree to any
waiver under the Financing Commitment Letter in a manner that: (i) adds new or
expands upon the conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letter, (ii) would reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing provided for under the Financing Commitment Letter,
(iii) would limit the rights and remedies of Clover as against the Lenders or
(iv) would otherwise prevent or delay or impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Clover may implement any
of the "market flex" provisions exercised by the Lenders in accordance with
any related flex letter as of the date hereof (or, in respect of any
Alternative Financing, in accordance with the "market flex" provisions
exercised by the Lenders in accordance with any flex letter relating thereto)
and (y) additional lenders and financing sources, and Affiliates thereof, may
be added (including in replacement of a Lender) to the Financing Commitment
Letter (or all or a portion of the commitments may be assigned to new or
existing lenders and financing sources) after the date hereof or thereof and
Clover may reallocate commitments or assign or re-assign titles and roles to
or among parties to the Financing Commitment Letter.

  

(ii) Without limitation of the obligations of SpinCo under this Agreement,
SpinCo shall give Clover prompt written notice if SpinCo obtains actual
Knowledge of (w) any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to the SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter; (x) any actual or threatened
withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by any of the Lenders;
(y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties
to the SpinCo Financing Commitment Letter relating to, or otherwise
potentially affecting, the amount or the availability of the Financing on the
Closing Date or satisfaction of the conditions thereunder; and (z) any
amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the SpinCo Financing Commitment
Letter.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing, each of Moon (on behalf of SpinCo) and SpinCo shall

SECTION 7.8. _Access to Information_.

  

During the Interim Period, subject to applicable Law, Moon shall, and shall
cause the SpinCo Entities, on the one hand, and Clover shall, and shall cause

Entities' (as applicable) normal operation, the offices, properties, books and
records, Contracts, files, audits and personnel of Clover and the Clover
Subsidiaries or the SpinCo Business and the SpinCo Entities (as applicable),
including the information set forth in _Schedule 7.8_ , and shall furnish such
Party and its Representatives with financial and operating data of Clover and
the Clover Subsidiaries or the SpinCo Business and the SpinCo Entities (as
applicable) and other information concerning the affairs of Clover and the
Clover Subsidiaries or the SpinCo Business and SpinCo Entities (as

reasonably request; _provided_ that (a) such investigation shall only be upon
reasonable notice; (b) no Party nor its Representatives shall be permitted to
perform any environmental sampling, including sampling of soil, groundwater,

attorney‑client privilege or other disclosure privilege to the first Person (
_provided_ that the Person that would otherwise be required to disclose
information to the other shall take any and all reasonable action necessary to
permit such disclosure without such violation of agreement or Law or loss of
privilege). The Parties hereby agree that the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
furnished by any Party or its Representatives thereunder and hereunder. SpinCo
will make available to Clover prior to the Closing true and complete copies of
the Organizational Documents of the SpinCo Subsidiaries.

  

SECTION 7.9. _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_

  

  

 

87  

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Clover shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present (as of the Effective
Time) and former officers and directors of each SpinCo Entity ("SpinCo
Directors and Officers") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other
applicable Law or provided under such SpinCo Entity's Organizational Documents
as in effect on the date hereof (or, in the case of a SpinCo Entity created
after the date hereof, on customary terms).

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Clover shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in each SpinCo Entity's Organizational
Documents regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
officers and directors and advancement of expenses to the SpinCo Entities'
respective former and current officers and directors that are no less
advantageous to those Persons than the corresponding provisions in existence
on the date hereof (or, in the case of a SpinCo Entity created after the date
hereof, on customary terms).

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.9_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Clover and the
Surviving Corporation and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each SpinCo Director and Officer and his or her heirs and
representatives. If Clover, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Clover or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

  

SECTION 7.10. _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Clover agrees that, except as expressly
permitted by this _Section 7.10_, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
and it shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

  

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Competing Proposal;

  

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Proposal, or provide any information or data to any Person in
connection with the foregoing, in each case, except to notify such Person of
the existence of the provisions of this _Section 7.10_;

  

(iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make a Competing
Proposal; or

  

(iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

88  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 7.10_, prior to but not after the time the Clover Stockholder
Approval is obtained, Clover may (A) provide information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.10_ if
the Person so requesting such information enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; or (B) engage or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 7.10_ , if and only to the extent that (I) prior to taking any action
described in clause (A) or (B) directly above, the Clover Board determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under
applicable Law and (II) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B)
directly above, the Clover Board has determined in good faith and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such
Competing Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

  

(b) _No Change in Clover Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

  

(i) The Clover Board shall not:

  

(x) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Moon, the
Clover Recommendation, (B) authorize, approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable, or publicly propose to authorize, approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable, any Competing Proposal, (C) fail to include the Clover
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (D) fail to recommend against a
tender offer or exchange offer for Clover Common Stock within 10 Business Days
after the commencement of such offer (any of the foregoing, a "Clover Change
of Recommendation"); or

  

(y) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section
7.10(b)(ii)_ hereof, cause or permit Clover or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Competing Proposal or otherwise
resolve or agree to do so.

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
7.10_, the Clover Board may, prior to but not after the time the Clover
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (A) make a Clover Change of Recommendation
if an Intervening Event has occurred or (B) make a Clover Change of
Recommendation or authorize Clover to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.3(a)_ to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal if Clover receives a Competing Proposal that the Clover
Board has determined in good faith, after consulting with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after
consulting with its outside legal counsel, in each case

  

  

 

89  

  

of (A) and (B), that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
such directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the
Clover Board may not take any such action unless (I) prior to making such
Clover Change of Recommendation or authorizing such termination to enter into
a definitive written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant
to _Section 9.3(a)_, Clover provides prior written notice to Moon at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") of its intention to
take such action and the basis thereof, including in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and in the case
of an Intervening Event, a description of such Intervening Event, (II) during
the Notice Period Clover shall negotiate with Moon in good faith should Moon
propose to make amendments or other revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Competing
Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal and, in the case of an
Intervening Event, the failure to take such action is no longer inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law as determined in the
good faith judgment of the Clover Board after consulting with its outside
legal counsel and (III) the Clover Board has taken into account any amendments
or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement agreed to by
Moon in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period and determined in good
faith that, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, a failure to make
such Clover Change of Recommendation continues to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; it being understood that any
material amendments or other material revisions to any Competing Proposal will
be deemed to be a new Competing Proposal, including for purposes of the Notice
Period, and any material change in the event, occurrence or facts constituting
an Intervening Event share require a new written notice to Moon and a new
Notice Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such new Notice Period
following any such material amendments or other material revisions to any
Competing Proposal or any material change in the event, occurrence or facts
constituting an Intervening Event shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days.

  

(c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.10_
shall prohibit Clover from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Section
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any legally
required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or a Competing Proposal, which actions shall
not constitute or be deemed to constitute a Clover Change of Recommendation so
long as any such disclosure (x) includes the Clover Recommendation, without
any alteration, modification or qualification thereof and (y) does not include
any statement that constitutes a Clover Change of Recommendation.

  

(d) _Termination of Existing Discussions_. Clover agrees that, as of the date
hereof, it shall cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Competing Proposal (other than with Moon and
its Affiliates and their Representatives).

  

(e) _Notice_. Clover agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours) notify Moon if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to a Competing Proposal are received by, any information in connection
therewith is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations related
thereto are sought to be initiated or continued

  

  

 

90  

  

with, Clover or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such
notice, the name of such Person making the Competing Proposal and providing
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
thereafter shall keep Moon reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status and material terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers
(including any material amendments thereto).

  

(f) Any failure of Clover's Subsidiaries or their Representatives to comply
with this _Section 7.10_ (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were
directly subject to this _Section 7.10_ ) shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 7.10_ by Clover.

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a third party relating to (A) a
merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, or similar
transaction involving Clover or (B) any acquisition by any Person or group (as
defined in or under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) other than Clover or any
of its Subsidiaries, Moon, SpinCo or any Affiliate thereof, in each of cases
(A) and (B) resulting in, or any proposal or offer which if consummated would
result in, any Person or group (as defined in or under Section 13 of the
Exchange Act) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one or
a series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the total voting power of
Clover Common Stock, or 20% or more of the total assets taken as a whole.

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written Competing
Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%")
made by a third party which did not result from a breach of this _Section
7.10_ , and which, in the good faith judgment of the Clover Board after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into
account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Competing
Proposal, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms and conditions and (B) if consummated, would result
in a transaction that is more favorable to Clover's stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and after taking into account all adjustments or
modifications to the terms and conditions thereof irrevocably agreed to in
writing by Moon pursuant to _Section 7.10(b)_ in response to such Superior
Proposal.

  

SECTION 7.11. _Public Announcements_

  

Clover, Moon, SpinCo and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing any press release, having any
communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any

SECTION 9.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

  

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) directly below, in the
event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this _Article IX_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or of any of
its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) subject to
clause (d) directly

  

  

 

105  

  

below, no such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages
to the other Party resulting from any Willful Breach of this Agreement and
(ii) this _Section 9.5_ and _Article X_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that

  

(i) this Agreement is terminated (A)(I) by either Clover or Moon pursuant to
(x) Section 9.2(a) or (y) Section 9.2(b) or (II) by Moon pursuant to Section
9.4(b); and (B)(I) before receipt of the Clover Stockholder Approval a
Competing Proposal has been publicly made or disclosed with respect to Clover
and, except where the Person who made such Competing Proposal or its
Affiliates is a party to the Competing Proposal contemplated in clause (B)(II)
has not been withdrawn (1) prior to the Outside Date in the case of clause
(A)(I)(x), (2) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Clover Stockholder
Meeting in the case of clause (A)(I)(y) or (3) at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the date of termination in the case of clause (A)(II) and (II) within
twelve months of such termination, Clover shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to or consummated any Competing
Proposal, (substituting "50%" for each reference to "20%" in the definition of
"Competing Proposal");

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Moon pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_; or

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Clover pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_;

  

then Clover shall pay Moon (or its designee(s)) a termination fee of
$176,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") (less any amounts paid pursuant to
_Section 9.5(e_ )) by wire transfer of same-day funds, such payment to be made
on the date of entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or consummation
of a Competing Proposal (whichever is earlier) in the case of clause (i)
above, within three Business Days after such termination in the case of clause
(ii) above, and prior to or concurrently with termination in the case of
clause (iii) above.

  

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
obligations contained in this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these covenants
and obligations, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement and
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Moon and SpinCo in the circumstances
in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement, the
Separation and Distribution Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Transaction Documents, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In the event
that Clover fails to promptly pay when due the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.5(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment Moon commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment against Clover for payment of the
Termination Fee, Clover shall pay to Moon its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such Proceeding, together with
interest on the Termination Fee at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

  

  

 

106  

  

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Clover be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon payment of the Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 9.5(b)_, neither Clover nor Merger Sub shall
have no further liability to Moon or SpinCo with respect to this Agreement,
the Separation and Distribution Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that
payment by Clover of the Termination Fee shall not relieve Clover from any
liability or damages resulting from any Willful Breach of this Agreement.

  

(e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_ , Clover
shall pay to Moon its Expenses in an amount not to exceed $35,000,000. Any
Expenses of Moon due under this _Section 9.5(e)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than two (2) Business Days
after receipt by Clover of an itemized statement identifying such Expenses.

SECTION 10.3. _Amendments and Waivers_

  

(a) Any Party may, at any time prior to the Closing, by action taken by its
board of directors, or officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement or (without limiting _Section 10.3(b)_)
agree to an amendment or modification to this Agreement by an agreement in
writing executed in the same manner (but not necessarily by the same Persons)
as this Agreement. No waiver by any of the Parties of any breach hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent breach hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue
of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of
any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in
writing and executed by the Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

  

(b) This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by a
duly authorized agreement in writing executed by the Parties in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement;
provided, that any amendments or modifications of this _Section 10.3(b)_ or

further approval by the stockholders of Clover without obtaining the further
approval of such stockholders.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that Steps 12A through 12D of the Plan of Reorganization are adopted in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, the parties will reasonably
cooperate to modify or amend the Merger Agreement and the Transaction
Documents to the extent necessary to permit the implementation of such Steps
12A through 12D, so long as such modification would not cause the Closing to
occur materially later than the date the Closing would otherwise have occurred
had such modification not been made.

  

SECTION 10.4. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_

  

(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law
principles thereof. The Parties expressly waive any right they may have, now
or in the future, to demand or seek the application of a governing Law other
than the Law of the State of Delaware.

  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, of if jurisdiction is not then available in such federal court, then
in any Delaware state court siting in New Castle County) and any appellate
court from any appeal thereof (the "Chosen Courts") in any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Action except in such
courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Action may be heard
and determined in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the Chosen Courts and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action in the Chosen Courts. Each of the
Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A

  

  

 

109  

  

TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.4(c)_.

  

SECTION 10.5. _Assignment; Parties in Interest; Non ‑Parties_

  

(a) No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement
without the written consent of the other Parties. Any attempted assignment or
delegation in breach of this _Section 10.5_ shall be null and void. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or
implied in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or
give any Person, other than the Parties, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, except as provided in _Section 7.9_ and _Section
10.5(b)_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered
thereby and may be enforced by such Persons)

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is hereby
agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims of action that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to, this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be made against the Parties, and no former, current or future Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, equityholders, lenders, financing sources,
managers, members, partners, agents or representatives of any Party, in each
case, who is not a party to this Agreement, shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby. Such Persons who are not
parties hereto are third party beneficiaries of _Section 10.3_, _Section
10.4_, and this _Section 10.5(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
10.5(b)_ shall not affect the rights of the Persons party to the Financing
Commitment Letter to enforce the Financing Commitment Letter in accordance
with its terms or the rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in
_Section 7.23_.

  

SECTION 10.6. _Captions; Counterparts_

  

The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be
considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by electronic or .pdf transmission), each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Delivery of any signature page by facsimile,
electronic or .pdf transmission shall be binding to the same extent as an
original signature page.

  

SECTION 10.7. _Entire Agreement_

  

  

 

110  

  

This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement,
including any related annexes, Exhibits and Schedules, as well as any other
agreements and documents referred to herein and therein, shall together
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of
the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 10.8. _Severability_

  

If any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, or the
application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement, they
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to
the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to
replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable
with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the
Parties.

  

SECTION 10.9. _Specific Performance_

  

In the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, the Party who is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the
right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief in
respect of its rights under this Agreement or such Transaction Document.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that each
Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the other Parties' obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
obligation to consummate the Closing and the obligations with respect to the
Financing), if the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) or waived (where permissible under applicable Law). The Parties agree
that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach, including
monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any
defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond
with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties to this Agreement.

  

SECTION 10.10. _Financing Sources._

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereto
hereby: (a) agree that any suit, action or Proceeding, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, involving any Lender Related Party, arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Financing or any of the agreements entered
into in connection with the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder (a "Financing
Action") shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County (and appellate courts thereof) and irrevocably submits itself and its
property

  

  

 

111  

  

with respect to any such Financing Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts, and such Financing Action (except to the extent relating to the
interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement (including any provision in
any documentation related to the Financing that expressly specifies that the
interpretation of such provisions shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware)) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of New York (without giving
effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction), (b) agree not to bring or support any
Financing Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Lender Related Party,
as the case may be, in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement,
the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County (and appellate courts thereof), (c) irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any Financing Action in any such court with respect to any
Financing Action against any Lender Related Party, (d) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, trial by jury in any Financing Action brought against the
Lender Related Parties in any way arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (e) agree that none of
the Lender Related Parties will have any liability to the parties to this
Agreement (in each case, other than Clover and its Subsidiaries from and after
the Closing) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise ( _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall affect the rights of Clover, Merger Sub or its Affiliates or
SpinCo or its Subsidiaries against the Lender Related Parties under any debt
commitment letter or any other agreement with respect to the Financing or any
of the transactions contemplated thereby or the any services thereunder), and
(f) agree that the Lender Related Parties are express third party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this Agreement
reflecting the foregoing agreements in this _Section 10.10_, and such
provisions and the definition of "Lenders" and "Lender Related Party" shall
not be amended in any way materially adverse to the Lender Related Parties
without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

THE REORGANIZATION

  

Section 2.1 _Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities Prior to the
Distribution_.

  

(a) In accordance with the plan and structure set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_
(such plan and structure, as it may be revised in accordance with _Section
2.1(d)_ , being referred to herein as the " _Plan of Reorganization_ ") and to
the extent not previously effected pursuant to the steps of the Plan of
Reorganization that have been completed prior to the date of this Agreement,
prior to the Distribution Time:

  

(i) _SpinCo Assets_. Moon shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries
to, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to SpinCo or one or more of SpinCo's
Subsidiaries designated by SpinCo, and SpinCo or such Subsidiaries shall
accept from Moon and Moon's applicable Subsidiaries, all of Moon's and such
Subsidiaries' respective direct or indirect right, title and interest in and
to all SpinCo Assets (in the case of the Moon Trademarks and all other SpinCo
IP, subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the
Intellectual Property Matters Agreement and Trademark License Agreement);

  

(ii) _SpinCo Liabilities_. SpinCo and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries
designated by SpinCo shall accept, assume and agree faithfully to perform,
discharge and fulfill the SpinCo Liabilities in accordance with their
respective terms (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not assume the
Excluded Liabilities). SpinCo and such Subsidiaries shall be responsible for
all SpinCo Liabilities, regardless of when or where such SpinCo Liabilities
arose or arise, or the legal entity that incurred or holds the SpinCo
Liability ( _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
preclude or inhibit SpinCo from asserting against third parties any defenses
available to the legal entity that incurred or holds such SpinCo Liability),
or whether the facts on which they are based occurred prior to, at or
subsequent to the Distribution Time, regardless of where or against whom such
SpinCo Liabilities are asserted or determined or whether asserted or
determined prior to the date of this Agreement;

  

 

15  

  

(iii) _Excluded Assets_. Moon shall cause the members of the SpinCo Group to
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Moon or one or more of its other
Subsidiaries designated by Moon (other than any member of the SpinCo Group),
and Moon or such other Subsidiaries shall accept from such applicable members
of the SpinCo Group, such applicable Person's respective direct or indirect
right, title and interest in and to any Excluded Assets; and

  

(iv) _Excluded Liabilities_. Moon and/or its Subsidiaries designated by Moon
(other than any member of the SpinCo Group) shall accept and assume from the
members of the SpinCo Group and agree faithfully to perform, discharge and
fulfill the Excluded Liabilities of such Persons, and Moon and/or its
applicable Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all Excluded Liabilities,
regardless of when or where such Excluded Liabilities arose or arise, or the
legal entity that incurred or holds the Excluded Liability ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall preclude or inhibit Moon from
asserting against third parties any defenses available to the legal entity
that incurred or holds such Excluded Liability), or whether the facts on which
they are based occurred prior to, at or subsequent to the Distribution Time,
regardless of where or against whom such Excluded Liabilities are asserted or
determined or whether asserted or determined prior to the date of this
Agreement.

  

(b) In furtherance of the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the
SpinCo Assets and the assumption of the SpinCo Liabilities in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ , on the date that such SpinCo
Assets are assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered or such SpinCo
Liabilities are assumed, and except with respect to matters addressed by the
Intellectual Property Matters Agreement: (i) Moon shall execute and deliver,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, such bills of sale,
deeds, stock powers, certificates of title, assignments of Contracts and other
instruments of transfer, conveyance and assignment as and to the extent
reasonably necessary to evidence the transfer, conveyance and assignment of
all of Moon's and its Subsidiaries' (other than the members of the SpinCo
Group) right, title and interest in and to such SpinCo Assets and (ii) SpinCo
shall execute and deliver, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver, such assumptions of Contracts and other instruments of assumption as
and to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective
assumption of the SpinCo Liabilities by SpinCo and its Subsidiaries.

  

(c) In furtherance of the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the
Excluded Assets and the assumption of the Excluded Liabilities in accordance
with _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ and _Section 2.1(a)(iv)_ , on the date that such
Excluded Assets are assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered or such
Excluded Liabilities are assumed, (i) SpinCo shall execute and deliver, and
shall cause the members of the SpinCo Group to execute and deliver, such bills
of sale, deeds, stock powers, certificates of title, assignments of Contracts
and other instruments of transfer, conveyance and assignment as and to the
extent reasonably necessary to evidence the transfer, conveyance and
assignment of all of SpinCo's and such Person's right, title and interest in
and to such Excluded Assets and (ii) Moon shall execute and deliver, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (other than the members of the SpinCo Group) to execute
and deliver, such assumptions of Contracts and other instruments of assumption
as and to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective
assumption of the Excluded Liabilities by Moon and its Subsidiaries. All of
the foregoing documents contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_ and this _Section
2.1(c)_ shall be referred to collectively herein as the " _Pre-Distribution
Transfer Documents_."

  

 

16  

  

(d) Without limiting any other provision hereof, in connection with the
reorganization contemplated by Section 2.1(a), each of Moon and SpinCo will
take, and will cause each member of its respective Group to take, such actions
as are reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Plan of Reorganization (whether prior to, at or after the Distribution Time).
Prior to the Distribution Time, Moon shall be permitted to update, modify or
supplement the then-current Plan of Reorganization (including by making
conforming amendments to Schedule 2.1(a)) if such update, modification or
supplement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, would include any additional
step or additional description of a step currently included on the Plan of
Reorganization) (i) is consistent in all respects with the allocation of
SpinCo Assets, SpinCo Liabilities, Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities in
accordance with the definitions of such terms and otherwise consistent in all
respects with allocations of assets and liabilities in the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) would not reasonably be expected to delay the Distribution
Date by more than sixty (60) days past the then-expected Distribution Date
and, in any event, not beyond the Outside Date (as defined the Merger
Agreement), (iii) in the case of any update, modification or supplement with
respect to SpinCo Assets and SpinCo Liabilities (whether in corporate form or
otherwise) that are already specifically reflected in the Plan of
Reorganization at the time of such proposed further update, modification, or
supplement, would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
incremental Liability (other than any Asbestos Liability) (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Tax Liability) to SpinCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless
and only to the extent such incremental Liability is expressly subject to
reimbursement or indemnification by Moon pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or is offset by savings otherwise obtained pursuant
to any update, modification or supplement to the Plan of Reorganization, (iv)
would not reasonably be expected (in light of the terms of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents) to impede the operations of or otherwise
adversely affect the SpinCo Business in any respect material to the SpinCo
Business and (v) would not restrict the disposition of any of the businesses
listed on Schedule I of the Tax Matters Agreement (any update, modification or
supplement described in this sentence, a "Permitted Reorganization
Amendment"). Moon shall regularly consult in good faith with Clover in the
course of the further development of the Plan of Reorganization, provide any
information reasonably requested by Clover related thereto, and consider in
good faith comments from Clover in respect of such further development of the
Plan of Reorganization. At such time as Moon notifies Clover in writing that
it proposes to make an amendment to the Plan of Reorganization, Moon shall
consider in good faith any further comments from Clover, but the determination
as to whether a proposed amendment constitutes a Permitted Reorganization
Amendment shall ultimately be reasonably determined in good faith by Moon.
Other than any Permitted Reorganization Amendment (and subject to compliance
with the notification and consultation obligations described in the preceding
two sentences) no update, modification or supplement to the then-current Plan
of Reorganization may be made by Moon without the prior written consent of
Clover (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Moon hereby acknowledges that it intends to seek a ruling with respect to
Steps 11A through 11C ("Alternative A") of the Plan of Reorganization. In
connection therewith, Moon shall keep Clover reasonably informed regarding the
filing of any ruling request and discussions relating thereto, shall notify
Clover of any representations made in such ruling request that would be
binding on the SpinCo Group if the ruling is obtained, and shall notify Clover
if the ruling is obtained. If it is determined that a ruling cannot be
obtained or it is no longer desirable to obtain

  

 

17  

  

such ruling, Moon shall implement Steps 12A through 12D ("Alternative B") of
the Plan of Reorganization, unless Moon determines to pursue another
alternative with respect to the distribution of SpinCo by Moon, in which case
unless Moon (i) provides Clover with a statement from Moon's Irish tax counsel
that is reasonably acceptable to Clover, based on advice of Clover's Irish tax
counsel, that Moon's Irish tax counsel expects to deliver the opinion
described in Section 7.3(b)(ii) of the Merger Agreement relating to clause (b)
of the definition of Tax-Free Status of the External Transactions (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) and provides Clover with sufficient detail of such
alternative such that Clover's Irish tax counsel may make such determination
and (ii) such alternative otherwise satisfies the criteria for a Permitted
Reorganization Amendment, such other alternative shall not be implemented
without the prior written consent of Clover (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

(e) SpinCo hereby waives compliance by each and every member of the Moon Group
with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer"
Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the
transfer or sale of any or all of the SpinCo Assets to any member of the
SpinCo Group.

  

(f) Moon hereby waives compliance by each and every member of the SpinCo Group
with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer"
Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the
transfer or sale of any or all of the Excluded Assets to any member of the
Moon Group.

  

(g) The Parties acknowledge and agree that as between the Moon Group and the
SpinCo Group, on the one hand, and any third Person asserting a Liability
against a member of the Moon Group or the SpinCo Group, on the other hand,
nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to grant such third Person
rights to assert such Liability against any legal entity within the Moon Group
or the SpinCo Group that would not be subject to such Liability absent this
Agreement.

  

Section 2.2 _Allocation of Assets_.

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _SpinCo Assets_ " shall mean the
following Assets (without duplication and excluding any Intellectual Property
Rights from each clause below other than clause (vi)), except for Excluded
Assets:

  

(i) the Assets listed or described on _Schedule 2.2(a)(i)_ ;

  

(ii) the shares of capital stock of, or any other equity or ownership
interests in, the Subsidiaries held, directly or indirectly, by Moon, listed
in _Schedule 2.2(a)(ii)_ (provided that Schedule 2.2(a)(ii) may be updated in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization to add or remove Persons on such
schedule) or otherwise contemplated to be part of SpinCo Group pursuant to the
Reorganization (which, for the avoidance of doubt, following the consummation
of the PFS Acquisition, shall include the PFS Group);

  

(iii) (A) the SpinCo Contracts and (B) any Shared Contracts to the extent
allocated to SpinCo pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ;

  

 

18  

  

(iv) the Assets reflected on the SpinCo Balance Sheet or the accounting
records supporting such balance sheet and any Assets acquired by or for the
SpinCo Business or any member of the SpinCo Group or the Moon Group subsequent
to the date of the SpinCo Balance Sheet which, had they been so acquired on or
before such date and owned as of such date, would have been reflected on the
SpinCo Balance Sheet or the accounting records supporting such balance sheet
if prepared on a consistent basis, subject to any acquisitions or dispositions
of Assets subsequent to the date of the SpinCo Balance Sheet as may be
expressly permitted under or consented to by Clover in accordance with the
Merger Agreement and this Agreement, but in all events excluding all cash and
cash equivalents (except for SpinCo Cash in excess of the Minimum Cash Amount
or as expressly otherwise provided in the Transaction Documents); _provided_ ,
that upon delivery of the Audited Financial Statements pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, each reference to the SpinCo Balance Sheet in this _Section
2.2(a)(iv)_ shall be deemed to instead refer to the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2018 included in the Audited Financial Statements;

  

(v) the SpinCo Cash up to the Minimum Cash Amount (to the extent taken into
account in the determination of SpinCo Cash Amount in the Final Adjustment
Amount pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ) and all bank accounts, lock boxes and other
deposit arrangements exclusively used in, held for use in or related to the
SpinCo Business;

  

(vi) the SpinCo IP, including all Moon Trademarks, together with any and all
rights to sue and recover for past, present and future infringement,

any member of the SpinCo Group thereunder), to the terms of the applicable
Insurance Policies and the Tender Agreement, the rights of any member of the
SpinCo Group under any occurrence-based Insurance Policies of Moon or its
Subsidiaries (as applicable) in place prior to the Distribution Date under
which SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group is insured (the " _Pre-
Closing Occurrence-Based Policies_ ") (it being understood that any
retrospective premiums, deductibles or other similar obligations arising from
any claim(s) by or on behalf of any SpinCo Group member under such Pre-Closing
Occurrence-Based Policies shall be borne by the SpinCo Group); provided
further that nothing in this clause shall be deemed to constitute (or to
reflect) an assignment of any or all of such Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based
Insurance Policies themselves (as distinguished from a grant of a right to
access coverage under such Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policies for the
Assumed Liabilities, as provided in _Section 7.3_ ), to SpinCo or any member
of the SpinCo Group;

  

(viii) (A) the offices, manufacturing facilities and other owned real property

subject to a site division, a lease or sublease back to a member of the Moon
Group as of the Distribution Time (a " _SpinCo Site_ "), but excluding the
items listed on _Schedule 2.2(a)(ix)_ (in each case excluding any such
tangible property owned by Persons other than Moon and its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Distribution Time; _provided_ that personal computers
and other personal equipment shall be retained by the Party who, following the
Distribution Time, retains the services of the applicable Service Provider
who, prior to the Distribution Time, used such personal computer);

  

(x) originals or, to the extent originals are not available by reason other
than that such originals are Excluded SpinCo Business Records, copies of all
SpinCo Business Records that are located at a SpinCo Site and copies of all
other SpinCo Business Records (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, such
SpinCo Business Records themselves);

  

(xi) all other Assets that are expressly provided by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document as Assets to be transferred to SpinCo or any other
member of the SpinCo Group; and

  

(xii) all Assets owned or held immediately prior to the Distribution Time by
Moon or any of its Subsidiaries primarily used in, held for use in or related
to the SpinCo Business _provided_ that no Asset shall be deemed to be a SpinCo
Asset solely as a result of this _clause (xiii)_ if such Asset is within the
category or type of Asset expressly covered by (1) another subsection of this
_Section 2.2(a)_ , (2) a subsection of _Section 2.2(b)_ or (3) by the terms of
another Transaction Document.

interests in, the Subsidiaries held, directly or indirectly, by Moon that are
not members of the SpinCo Group and (B) the shares of capital stock of, or any
other equity or ownership interests in, the entities held by Moon that are not
members of the SpinCo Group;

Section 2.3 _Allocation of Liabilities_.

  

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _SpinCo Liabilities_ " shall mean
the following Liabilities (without duplication):

  

(i) [reserved];

  

(ii) all Liabilities to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting

arising out of or resulting from any act or failure to act by any Person,
whether or not such act or failure to act is or was within such Person's
authority, with respect to such business);

  

(C) the SpinCo Assets; or

  

(D) any Environmental Condition or any matter subject to or regulated by
Environmental Law, in each case whether before, at or after the Distribution

owned, leased or occupied by any member of the SpinCo Group from and after the
Distribution Time; (ii) the ownership, occupancy or use of any property

Materials by the SpinCo Business or by or on behalf of any member of the
SpinCo Group (other than at a property of any member of the Moon Group

balance sheet (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all accounts payable and
deferred revenue reflected therein), and all Liabilities arising or assumed
after the date of the SpinCo Balance Sheet which, had they arisen or been
assumed on or before such date and been retained as of such date, would have
been reflected on the SpinCo Balance Sheet or the accounting records
supporting such balance sheet if prepared on a consistent basis (including, in
any event, all Liabilities of SpinCo under the Total SpinCo Debt), subject, in
each case, to any discharge of such Liabilities subsequent to the date of the
SpinCo Balance Sheet; provided, that upon delivery of the Audited Financial
Statements pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each reference to the SpinCo
Balance Sheet in this _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_ shall be deemed to instead refer
to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 included in the Audited Financial
Statements;

  

(iv) the Liabilities arising out of or resulting from (A) the Total SpinCo
Debt, (B) capitalized and operating lease obligations related to the SpinCo
Business as of the Distribution Date to the extent such capitalized and
operating leases are SpinCo Assets or (C) the SpinCo Indebtedness (to the
extent taken into account in the determination of SpinCo Indebtedness in the
Final Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ); and

  

(v) all other Liabilities that are expressly provided by this Agreement or any

(iii) all Liabilities, whether presently in existence or arising after the
date of this Agreement, relating to fees, commissions or expenses owed to any
broker, finder, investment banker, accountant, attorney or other intermediary
or advisor engaged by any member of the Moon Group or, to the extent the
relevant engagement was entered into prior to the Distribution Time, any
member of the SpinCo Group, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent otherwise provided in the Merger
Agreement or any Transaction Document); _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not include any fees, commissions or expenses with respect to the Total SpinCo
Debt;

  

 

22  

  

(iv) all Liabilities to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting

of Moon or any of its Affiliates who was a director, officer, manager, agent

(" _Excluded Asbestos Liabilities_ "), but not including the Specified
Asbestos Liabilities;

(B) the use, treatment, Release, handling, transportation or disposal of
Hazardous Materials on or from any property of the Moon Group; and

  

(vii) all other Liabilities of Moon and its Subsidiaries that are expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document as
Liabilities to be retained or assumed by Moon or any other member of the Moon

Documents.

  

Section 2.4 _Transfer of Excluded Assets and Assumption of Excluded
Liabilities Not Effected at or Prior to the Distribution Time_.

  

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_ , to the extent any Excluded Asset is
transferred or assigned to, or any Excluded Liability is assumed by, a member
of the SpinCo Group at or prior to the Distribution Time, or is owned or held
by a member of the SpinCo Group after the Distribution Time, from and after
the Distribution Time:

  

(i) SpinCo shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, promptly
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Moon or certain of its Subsidiaries
designated by Moon, and Moon or such Subsidiaries shall accept from SpinCo and
its applicable Subsidiaries, all of SpinCo's and such Subsidiaries' respective
right, title and interest in and to such Excluded Assets (in the case of the
Moon IP, subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the
Intellectual Property Matters Agreement); and

  

 

23  

  

(ii) Moon and/or its Subsidiaries designated by Moon shall promptly accept,
assume and agree faithfully to perform, discharge and fulfill all such
Excluded Liabilities in accordance with their respective terms.

  

(b) In furtherance of the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of
Excluded Assets and the assumption of Excluded Liabilities provided for in
_Section 2.4(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.4(a)(ii)_ and the other Transaction
Documents and without any additional consideration therefor: (i) SpinCo shall
execute and deliver, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver,
such bills of sale, deeds, stock powers, certificates of title, assignments of
Contracts and other instruments of transfer, conveyance and assignment as and
to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the transfer, conveyance and
assignment of all of SpinCo's and its Subsidiaries' right, title and interest
in and to the Excluded Assets to Moon and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) Moon
shall execute and deliver, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to execute and
deliver, such assumptions of Contracts and other instruments of assumption as
and to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective
assumption of the Excluded Liabilities by Moon or its Subsidiaries. All of the
foregoing documents contemplated by this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be referred to
collectively herein as the " _Post-Distribution SpinCo Transfer Documents_."

  

(c) To the extent that the transfer or assignment of any Excluded Asset or the
assumption of any Excluded Liability requires any Approvals or Notifications,
the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain or make such
Approvals or Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except to the extent expressly provided in _Section 7.4_ or
in any of the other Transaction Documents, neither Moon nor SpinCo shall be
obligated to contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form
(including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or
commercial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or make such
Approvals or Notifications; _provided,_ _further_ , that the obligation to
obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications shall terminate on the date
that is twenty-four (24) months after the Distribution.

  

(d) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or
assignment to the Moon Group of any Excluded Assets or the assumption by the
Moon Group of any Excluded Liabilities would be a violation of applicable Law
or require any Approval or Notification that has not been made or obtained at
or prior to the Distribution Time, then, unless the Parties shall mutually
otherwise determine, the transfer or assignment to the Moon Group of such
Excluded Assets or the assumption by the Moon Group of such Excluded
Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and
any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void
until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or
Notifications have been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities shall continue to constitute
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities for all other purposes of this
Agreement.

  

(e) If any transfer or assignment of any Excluded Asset or any assumption of
any Excluded Liability intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed under
this Agreement or other Transaction Documents is not consummated at or prior
to the Distribution Time, whether as a result of the provisions of _Section
2.4(d)_ or for any other reason, then the Parties shall cooperate to effect
such transfers as promptly following the Distribution Time as practicable and,
prior to the effectiveness of such transfer of Assets or assumption of
Liabilities, the member of

  

 

24  

  

the SpinCo Group retaining such Excluded Asset or such Excluded Liability, as
the case may be, shall thereafter hold such Excluded Asset in trust for the
use and benefit of the member of the Moon Group entitled thereto (at the
expense of the member of the Moon Group entitled thereto) and retain such
Excluded Liability for the account of the member of the Moon Group and
otherwise enter into mutually acceptable arrangements, including
subcontracting, sublicensing, subleasing, back-to-back agreement, or other
similar arrangement, to convey the economic rights and obligations relating to
such Excluded Assets or Excluded Liability to the Moon Group. In addition, the
member of the SpinCo Group retaining such Excluded Asset or such Excluded
Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, treat such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability in the
ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take such
other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the Moon Group
to whom such Excluded Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or which will
assume such Excluded Liability, as the case may be, in order to place such
member of the Moon Group in the same position as if such Excluded Asset or
Excluded Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated
hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, including use, risk of loss,
potential for gain and dominion, control and command over such Excluded Asset
or Excluded Liability, as the case may be, are to inure from and after the
Distribution Time to the Moon Group. Except to the extent otherwise required
by applicable Law, each of Moon and SpinCo shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) for all U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and
foreign) income tax purposes, treat any Excluded Asset and any Excluded
Liability transferred, assigned or assumed after the Distribution Time
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(e)_ as having been so transferred, assigned or
assumed prior to the Distribution Time pursuant to the Reorganization and (ii)
subject to the terms and conditions of the Tax Matters Agreement, file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment and not take any Tax
position inconsistent therewith.

  

(f) If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused
the deferral of transfer or assignment of any Excluded Asset or the deferral
of assumption of any Excluded Liability pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ , are
obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal impediments for the
transfer or assignment of any Excluded Assets or the assumption of any
Excluded Liabilities have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the
applicable Excluded Asset or the assumption of the applicable Excluded
Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and/or the applicable other Transaction Document.

  

(g) Any member of the SpinCo Group retaining an Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability due to the deferral of the transfer or assignment of such Excluded
Asset or the deferral of the assumption of such Excluded Liability, as the
case may be, shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to
expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced (or otherwise made
available or agreed in advance to be reimbursed) by Moon or the member of the
Moon Group entitled to the Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, as the case
may be, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and
recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by Moon
or the member of the Moon Group entitled to such Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability.

Distribution Moon Transfer Documents_."

  

(c) To the extent that the transfer or assignment of any SpinCo Asset or the
assumption of any SpinCo Liability requires any Approvals or Notifications,
the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain or make such
Approvals or Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except to the extent expressly provided in _Section 7.4_ or
in any of the other Transaction Documents, neither Moon nor SpinCo shall be

otherwise determine, the transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group

of such SpinCo Assets or the assumption by the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo
Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and
any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void
until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or

Contract, between or among SpinCo and/or any member of the SpinCo Group, on
the one hand, and Moon and/or any member of the Moon Group, on the other hand,
that are effective or outstanding as of immediately prior to the Distribution

from and after the Distribution Time, no member of either the Moon Group or
SpinCo Group shall have any rights or obligations thereunder and all parties

Section 2.7 _Shared Assets; Shared Contracts_.

  

(a) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to separate, as soon
as practicable and to the extent practicable prior to the Distribution Time,
the Shared Assets into separate Assets so that the SpinCo Business will remain
entitled to the rights and benefits, and shall be subject to the Liabilities,
with respect to or arising from each Shared Asset to the extent related to the
SpinCo Business on substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to
the SpinCo Business immediately prior to the Distribution Time with respect to
such Shared Asset, and Moon will retain the rights and benefits, and shall be
subject to the Liabilities, with respect to or arising from each Shared Asset
to the extent related to the Moon Business on substantially the same terms and
conditions applicable to the Moon Business immediately prior to the
Distribution Time with respect to such Shared Assets; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that except to the extent expressly provided in _Section 7.4_ or in any of the
other Transaction Documents, neither Moon nor SpinCo shall be obligated to
contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing
any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or commercial accommodation)
to any Person in order to obtain or make any Approvals or Notifications
necessary to effect such separation of Shared Assets. If any third party that
is entitled to consent to the separation of the Shared Asset has not provided
such consent or if the separation of a Shared Asset has not been completed as
of the Distribution Date for any other reason, then the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to develop and implement mutually agreed
arrangements (including subcontracting, sublicensing, subleasing or back-to-
back agreement) to pass along to, and make available for use by, the SpinCo
Group the benefit and the Liabilities (including any Tax Liabilities) of the
portion of any such Shared Asset related to the SpinCo Business and to pass
along to, and make available for use by, the Moon Group the benefit and the
Liabilities (including any Tax Liabilities) of the portion of the Shared Asset
related to the Moon Business, as the case may be. No member of the Moon Group
shall claim depreciation, amortization or any other tax benefit with respect
to the portion of any such Shared Asset related to the SpinCo Business and no
member of the SpinCo Group shall claim depreciation, amortization or any other
tax benefit with respect to the portion of any such Shared Asset related to
the Moon Business. If and when any such consent is obtained, the Shared Asset
will be separated in accordance with this _Section 2.7_. The obligations set
forth in this _Section 2.7_ shall terminate on the date that is twenty-four
(24) months after the Distribution Date.

  

(b) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to identify and
partially assign or otherwise separate, as soon as practicable and to the
extent practicable prior to the Distribution Time, the Shared Contracts into
separate contracts so that the SpinCo Business will remain entitled to the
rights and benefits, and shall be subject to the Liabilities, with respect to
or arising from each Shared Contract to the extent related to the SpinCo
Business on substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to the
SpinCo Business immediately prior to the Distribution Time under such Shared
Contract, and Moon will retain the rights and benefits, and shall be subject
to the Liabilities, with respect to or arising from each Shared Contract to
the

  

 

29  

  

extent related to the Moon Business on substantially the same terms and
conditions applicable to the Moon Business immediately prior to the
Distribution Time with respect to such Shared Contracts (it being understood
that Shared Contracts may include volume-based pricing or other incentive
mechanisms or pricing benefits that will not be retained); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except to the extent expressly provided in _Section 7.4_ or
in any of the other Transaction Documents, neither Moon nor SpinCo shall be
obligated to contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form
(including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or
commercial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or make any
Approvals or Notifications necessary to effect such separation of Shared
Contracts. If a counterparty to any Shared Contract that is entitled under the
terms of the Shared Contract to consent to the separation of the Shared
Contract has not provided such consent or if the separation of a Shared
Contract has not been completed as of the Distribution Date for any other
reason, then the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
develop and implement mutually agreed arrangements (including subcontracting,
sublicensing, subleasing or back-to-back agreement) to pass along to, and make
available for use by, the SpinCo Group the benefit and the Liabilities
(including any Tax Liabilities) of the portion of any such Shared Contract
related to the SpinCo Business and to pass along to, and make available for
use by, the Moon Group the benefit and the Liabilities (including any Tax
Liabilities) of the portion of the Shared Contract related to the Moon
Business, as the case may be. No member of the Moon Group shall claim
depreciation, amortization or any other tax benefit with respect to the
portion of any such Shared Contract related to the SpinCo Business and no
member of the SpinCo Group shall claim depreciation, amortization or any other
tax benefit with respect to the portion of any such Shared Contract related to
the Moon Business. If and when any such consent is obtained, the Shared
Contract will be separated in accordance with this _Section 2.7_. With respect
to each Shared Contract, the obligations set forth in this _Section 2.7_ shall
terminate upon the date that is twenty four (24) months after the Distribution
Date.

  

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, pending the separation of each Shared
Asset or Shared Contract, the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to) use their reasonable best efforts to maintain good relations
with any obligees or other counterparties in connection with such Shared Asset
or Shared Contract, keep such Shared Asset in good condition (ordinary course
wear and tear excepted) and, in the case of Shared Contracts, comply in all
material respects with the terms thereof and refrain from voluntarily
terminating such Shared Contract.

  

(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, each of Moon
and SpinCo shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) for all U.S. federal
(and applicable state, local and foreign) income tax purposes, treat the
portion of each Shared Asset and each Shared Contract the rights and benefits
of which inure to it or a member of its Group as Assets owned by, and/or
Liabilities of, as applicable, it or the members of its Group, as applicable,
as of no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) subject
to the terms and conditions of the Tax Matters Agreement, file all Tax Returns

Statement, the determination of the Disputed Items, the preparation of the
Notice of Objection and the other matters contemplated by this _Section 2.8_.

  

(d) _Disputes_.

  

(i) In the event SpinCo disputes the correctness of the Closing Working
Capital, the SpinCo Cash Amount, the SpinCo Indebtedness and the Target
Working Capital (or any component thereof) as set forth in the Closing
Statement, SpinCo shall deliver to Moon a reasonably detailed written
statement describing each objection (with reference to the applicable account
description) and specifying the amount that SpinCo reasonably believes is the
correct amount for each disputed item (such statement, the " _Notice of
Objection_ ") within ninety (90) days after receipt of the Closing Statement,
and shall set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail, the reasons for
SpinCo's objections.

  

(ii) If SpinCo timely delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with
_Section 2.8(d)(i)_ , only those matters specified in such Notice of Objection
shall be deemed to be in dispute (the " _Disputed Items_ "), and all other
matters included in the Closing Statement, shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the Parties. If SpinCo does not deliver a Notice of Objection
before the conclusion of the ninety (90)-day period referred to in _Section
2.8(d)(i)_ , the Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Parties and SpinCo shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement. Moon and SpinCo shall endeavor in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Items within sixty (60) days after Moon's
receipt of the Notice of Objection (the " _Resolution Period_ ").

  

(iii) If Moon and SpinCo are unable to resolve any Disputed Item during the
Resolution Period, Moon and SpinCo jointly shall, as soon as practicable and
in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period, engage KPMG (or, if KPMG is not available or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, an internationally recognized independent accounting
firm, which firm shall not be the then regular auditors of

  

 

33  

  

Moon, SpinCo or Clover) (the firm so engaged, the " _Unaffiliated Accounting
Firm_ "), to resolve the Disputed Items in a manner consistent with this
_Section 2.8_. Promptly after joint engagement of the Unaffiliated Accounting
Firm, Moon and SpinCo shall provide the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm with a
copy of this Agreement, the Closing Statement and the Notice of Objection and
all other documentary materials and analyses that SpinCo or Moon, as
applicable, believes may be relevant to resolution of the Disputed Items. Each
of Moon and SpinCo shall deliver to the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm and to
the other Party simultaneously a written submission of its final position with
respect to each of the Disputed Items (which position may not be outside of
the range between the respective amounts set forth in the Closing Statement
and the Notice of Objection) within ten (10) Business Days of the engagement
of such Unaffiliated Accounting Firm. Each of Moon and SpinCo shall thereafter
be entitled to submit a rebuttal to the other's submission, which rebuttals
shall be delivered to the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm and to the other Party
simultaneously within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of the Parties'
initial submissions to the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm and to each other.
Neither Party may make (nor permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to
make) any additional submission to the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm or
otherwise communicate with the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm. In no event shall
either Party (i) communicate (or permit any of its Affiliates or
Representatives to communicate) with the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm without
providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in such
communication or (ii) make (or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives
to make) a written submission to the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm unless a
copy of such submission is simultaneously provided to the other Party. The
Unaffiliated Accounting Firm shall have thirty (30) days following submission
of the Parties' rebuttals to review the documents provided to it pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_ and to deliver its reasoned written determination with
respect to each of the Disputed Items submitted to it for resolution, as well
as its determination of each component of the Adjustment Amount that was a
Disputed Item. The Unaffiliated Accounting Firm shall resolve Disputed Items
submitted to it based solely on the information provided to the Unaffiliated
Accounting Firm by the Parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and not
by independent review. The Unaffiliated Accounting Firm's authority shall be
limited to resolving disputes with respect to whether the individual Disputed
Items were prepared in accordance with _Schedule 2.8(a)(i)_ and otherwise in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. The resolution of such Disputed
Items by the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm (i) shall be set forth in writing,
(ii) shall be within the range of dispute between Moon and SpinCo and (iii)
shall constitute an arbitral award. The determination of the Unaffiliated
Accounting Firm in respect of each Disputed Item shall be final, conclusive
and binding on Moon and SpinCo and not subject to appeal by either of the
Parties, and judgment thereof may be entered or enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

  

(iv) The fees and expenses, if any, of the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be allocated between the
Parties based upon the ratio which the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items
(other than the Target Working Capital) awarded to SpinCo bears to the
aggregate amount of the Disputed Items contested by SpinCo. For example, if
SpinCo claims that the SpinCo Indebtedness is $1,000 greater (in SpinCo's
favor) than the SpinCo Indebtedness determined by Moon, and if the
Unaffiliated Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the Disputed Items by
awarding to SpinCo $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and
expenses of the Unaffiliated Accounting Firm will be allocated 30% (i.e., $300
÷ $1,000) to Moon and 70% (i.e., $700 ÷ $1,000) to SpinCo.

  

 

34  

  

(e) _Final Adjustment_. The Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.8_ (whether by failure of SpinCo to deliver a Notice of
Objection, by agreement of Moon and SpinCo or by determination of the
Unaffiliated Accounting Firm), is referred to herein as the " _Final
Adjustment Amount_ ".

  

(f) Not later than five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount, a payment by wire transfer in respect thereof shall be made
as follows:

  

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then such amount
shall be paid by the SpinCo Borrower to Moon LuxCo or, with the agreement of
Moon, another entity in the Moon Group; and

  

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then such amount
shall be paid by Moon LuxCo to the SpinCo Borrower.

  

Any payment pursuant to this _Section 2.8(f)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the SpinCo Payment for all U.S. federal (and applicable state,
local and foreign) income Tax purposes and shall be made in immediately
available funds in United States dollars by wire transfer to a bank account
designated in writing by the Party entitled to receive the payment.

  

(g) If the SpinCo Cash Amount is greater than the SpinCo Minimum Cash Amount,
SpinCo shall, following the Closing and as requested by Moon, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver cash in an aggregate amount equal to such excess
to Moon LuxCo or as otherwise directed by Moon; _provided_ that, to the extent
any member of the SpinCo Group would incur costs (including any Taxes) in
transferring such cash as instructed by Moon, SpinCo shall inform Moon of the
amount of such costs and, if Moon elects to proceed with the requested
transfer, Moon shall bear such cost.

  

Section 2.9 _Bank Accounts_.

  

(a) Moon and SpinCo each agrees to take, or cause the respective members of
their respective Groups to take, prior to the Distribution Time (or as soon as
possible thereafter), all actions necessary to amend all Contracts governing
each bank and brokerage account owned by SpinCo or any other member of the
SpinCo Group (collectively, the " _SpinCo Accounts_ "), so that such SpinCo
Accounts, if currently linked (whether by automatic withdrawal, automatic
deposit or any other authorization to transfer funds from or to, hereinafter "
_linked_ ") to any bank or brokerage account owned by Moon or any other member
of the Moon Group (collectively, the " _Moon Accounts_ ") are de-linked from
such Moon Accounts.

  

(b) Moon and SpinCo each agrees to take, or cause the respective members of
their respective Groups to take, prior to the Distribution Time (or as soon as
possible thereafter), all actions necessary to amend all Contracts governing
the Moon Accounts so that such Moon Accounts, if currently linked to any
SpinCo Account, are de-linked from such SpinCo Accounts.

  

(c) With respect to any outstanding checks issued by Moon, SpinCo or any of
their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Distribution Time, such outstanding
checks shall be honored from and after the Distribution Time by the Person or
Group owning the account on

  

 

35  

  

which the check is drawn, without limiting the ultimate allocation of
Liability for such amounts under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

  

(d) As between Moon and SpinCo (and the members of their respective Groups),
except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, all payments and
reimbursements received after the Distribution Time by either Party (or member
of its Group) to which the other Party (or member of its Group) is entitled
under this Agreement shall be held by such receiving Party in trust for the
use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto and, within sixty (60) days of
receipt by such receiving Party of any such payment or reimbursement, such
receiving Party shall pay over, or shall cause the applicable member of its
Group to pay over to the other Party or the applicable member of the other
Party's Group, the amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of
setoff.

  

Section 2.10 _Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties_. EACH OF MOON (ON
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE MOON GROUP) AND SPINCO (ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE SPINCO GROUP AND THE CLOVER GROUP) UNDERSTANDS
AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR DOCUMENT
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS REPRESENTING OR WARRANTING TO
ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR THERETO IN ANY WAY AS TO THE ASSETS, BUSINESSES OR
LIABILITIES TRANSFERRED OR ASSUMED AS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY; AS TO
ANY APPROVALS OR NOTIFICATIONS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH;
AS TO THE VALUE OR FREEDOM FROM ANY LIENS OF, OR ANY OTHER MATTER CONCERNING,
ANY ASSETS OF SUCH PARTY; AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFENSES OR RIGHT OF SETOFF
OR FREEDOM FROM COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR OTHER ASSET,
INCLUDING ANY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OF ANY PARTY; OR AS TO THE LEGAL
SUFFICIENCY OF ANY ASSIGNMENT, DOCUMENT, CERTIFICATE OR INSTRUMENT DELIVERED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT
TO CONVEY TITLE TO ANY ASSET OR THING OF VALUE UPON THE EXECUTION, DELIVERY
AND FILING HEREOF OR THEREOF. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR
DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, ALL SUCH ASSETS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED
ON AN "AS IS," "WHERE IS" BASIS, AND THE RESPECTIVE TRANSFEREES SHALL BEAR THE
ECONOMIC AND LEGAL RISKS THAT (I) ANY CONVEYANCE SHALL PROVE TO BE
INSUFFICIENT TO VEST IN THE TRANSFEREE GOOD OR MARKETABLE TITLE, FREE AND
CLEAR OF ANY LIEN, AND (II) ANY NECESSARY APPROVALS OR NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT
OBTAINED OR MADE OR THAT ANY REQUIREMENTS OF LAWS OR JUDGMENTS ARE NOT
COMPLIED WITH.

  

Section 2.11 _Post-Distribution Communications_. After the Distribution Time,
each Party or any member of its Group may receive mail, packages and other
communications properly belonging to the other Party or any member of its
Group. At all times after the

  

 

36  

  

Distribution Time, each Party and the members of its Group are hereby
authorized to receive and open all mail, packages and other communications
received by such Party or member that belongs to the other Party or any
members of its Group, and to the extent that such mail, packages or other
communications do not relate to the business of the receiving Party or member,
the receiving Party or member shall promptly deliver such mail, packages or
other communications (or, in case the same also relates to the business of the
receiving Party or member, copies thereof) to the other Party as provided for
in _Section 9.5_. The provisions of this _Section 2.11_ are not intended to,
and shall not, be deemed to, constitute an authorization by any Party to
permit the other to accept service of process on its behalf, and no Party is
or shall be deemed to be the agent of any other Party for service of process
purposes.

  

Section 2.12 _Cooperation_. Except as expressly provided by this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, including _Section
2.1(d)_ , (a) prior to the Distribution Date, Moon shall keep Clover
reasonably informed on a current basis and furnish Clover with information
relating to the determination of the Assets that are proposed to be
transferred to, and Liabilities that are proposed to be assumed by, the SpinCo
Group under any Transaction Document, and (b) to the extent any Transaction
Documents or exhibits or schedules thereto are to be completed following the
date hereof, Moon and SpinCo shall consult with Clover in good faith regarding
the terms and conditions to be included in such documents, exhibits or
schedules, give Clover a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents,
exhibits or schedules including on any additions or modifications to such
documents, take such comments into account in good faith in finalizing such
documents, exhibits or schedules; _provided_ that Moon and SpinCo shall not
finalize such documents, exhibits or schedules without the prior written
consent of Clover (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except if a different standard for consent is specified elsewhere
in this Agreement or in the Merger Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, in which case, such standard shall apply in respect of such
consent.

  

Section 2.13 _Certain IT Matters_. Moon and SpinCo will, and will cause their
respective Groups to, use their reasonable best efforts to take the actions
and shall pay, or will cause their respective Groups to pay, the costs to be
borne by their respective Groups, as set forth in _Schedule 2.13_.

  


 

  

Section 2.14 _FX and Hedging Arrangements_. Moon shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that, as of immediately prior to the Distribution Time, no
member of the SpinCo Group is a party to any hedging-related transaction
(including any swap, exchange, derivative, rate, forward, hedge or other
similar transactions or any combination of any of the foregoing or any options
to enter into any of the foregoing) (" _Hedging Transactions_ ") or any
Contracts or confirmations related thereto (" _Hedging Contracts_ ") and that,
as of immediately prior to the Distribution Time, all such Hedging
Transactions and Hedging Contracts shall have been terminated, with no further
force or effect. For the avoidance of doubt, any Liabilities of SpinCo or any
member of the SpinCo Group as a result of such termination shall constitute
SpinCo Indebtedness.

  

Section 2.15 _Specified Asbestos Liabilities_. The Parties agree that the
Specified Asbestos Liabilities shall not constitute SpinCo Liabilities and
shall not be assumed by any member of the SpinCo Group.

ARTICLE III

  

THE DISTRIBUTION

  

Section 3.1 _Actions at or Prior to the Distribution Time_. Prior to the
Distribution Time and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the following shall occur:

  

(a) _Securities Law Matters_.

  

(i) SpinCo shall cooperate with Moon to accomplish the Distribution, including
in connection with the preparation of all documents and the making of all
filings required in connection with the Distribution. Moon shall be permitted
to reasonably direct and control the efforts of the Parties in connection with
the Distribution, and SpinCo shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other
things reasonably necessary to facilitate the Distribution as reasonably
directed by Moon in good faith and in accordance with the applicable terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

  

(ii) SpinCo shall file the Disclosure Documents and any amendments or
supplements thereto as may be necessary or advisable in order to cause the
Disclosure Documents to become and remain effective as required by the SEC or
federal, state, foreign or other applicable securities Laws. Moon and SpinCo
shall prepare and mail or otherwise make available, prior to the Distribution
Date, to the holders of Moon Ordinary Shares, such information concerning
SpinCo, Clover, their respective businesses, operations and management, the
Distribution and such other matters as Moon shall reasonably determine and as
may be required by applicable Law. Moon and SpinCo will prepare, and SpinCo
will, to the extent required by applicable Law, file with the SEC, any such
documentation and any requisite no-action letters which Moon determines are
necessary or desirable to effectuate the Distribution, and Moon and SpinCo
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
approvals from the SEC with respect thereto as soon as practicable. Moon and
SpinCo shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate under
the securities or "blue sky" Laws of states or other political subdivisions of
the United States and shall use their reasonable best efforts to comply with
all applicable foreign securities Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  

(b) _Financing_. On or before the Distribution Date, subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 7.7 of the Merger Agreement, SpinCo or a member of the
SpinCo Group (such Person, the " _SpinCo Borrower_ ") shall enter into a
definitive agreement or agreements providing for indebtedness in an aggregate
available principal amount equal to $1,900,000,000, which indebtedness shall
consist of borrowings on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Financing Commitment Letter (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
(collectively, the " _SpinCo Debt_ "). Between the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Distribution Time, subject to the terms and conditions of Section
7.7 of the Merger Agreement, the SpinCo Borrower shall incur the SpinCo Debt
and receive the proceeds thereof in order to fund the SpinCo Payment.

  

(c) _Contribution_. Prior to the Distribution, in consideration of the
transfer of the SpinCo Assets contemplated by the Reorganization, (A) SpinCo
shall issue to Moon or a

  

 

38  

  

member of the Moon Group additional shares of SpinCo Common Stock such that
the number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock then outstanding shall be equal to
the number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock necessary to effect the
Distribution, and (B) the SpinCo Borrower shall pay to Moon LuxCo cash in an
aggregate amount equal to $1,900,000,000 (the " _SpinCo Payment_ "), in
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Moon;
_provided_ that if the PFS Acquisition has not been consummated prior to the
Distribution Time (whether or not the PFS Acquisition Agreement has been
terminated), the SpinCo Payment shall be decreased by $1,450,000,000.

  

(d) _Distribution Agent_. Moon shall enter into a distribution agent agreement
with the Distribution Agent or otherwise provide instructions to the
Distribution Agent regarding the Distribution.

  

(e) _Satisfying Conditions to the Distribution_. Moon and SpinCo shall
cooperate to cause the conditions to the Distribution set forth in _Section
3.2_ to be satisfied and to effect the Distribution at the Distribution Time
upon such satisfaction (or waiver). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain an opinion from an independent appraisal firm to the Board of Directors
of Moon (or a designated committee thereof) as to the solvency of SpinCo after
giving effect to the SpinCo Payment and the consummation of the Contribution
and the Distribution (the " _Solvency Opinion_ ").

  

Section 3.2 _Conditions Precedent to the Distribution_. In no event shall the
Distribution occur unless each of the following conditions shall have been
satisfied or waived by Moon, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion
(other than the condition set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ , which prior to the
termination of the Merger Agreement may not be waived without Clover's written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed):

  

(a) the Reorganization (including the SpinCo Payment) shall have been
completed substantially in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization (other
than those steps that are expressly contemplated to occur at or after the
Distribution);

  

(b) the consummation or satisfaction of the actions set forth in _Section
3.1(c)_ ; and

  

(c) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
of the Merger Agreement, in each case other than those conditions that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied contemporaneously with the Distribution or
the Merger.

  

Each of the foregoing conditions is for the sole benefit of Moon and shall not
give rise to or create any duty on the part of Moon or its Board of Directors
(or any committee thereof) to waive or not to waive any such condition in this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement, or in any way limit Moon's rights of
termination set forth in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the Parties' rights under
Section 7.6 of the Merger Agreement.

  

 

39  

  

Section 3.3 _The Distribution_.

  

(a) Moon may elect, in its sole discretion, to effect the Distribution in the
form of (i) a One-Step Spin-Off; or (ii) an Exchange Offer (including any
Clean-Up Spin-Off), _provided_ that (A) the economic value of the Merger to
each of Moon and Clover is preserved, (B) the Exchange Offer (including any
Clean-Up Spin-Off) does not create any material and adverse Tax consequences
to Clover and (C) the Exchange Offer (including any Clean-Up Spin-Off) does
not materially delay the consummation of the Distribution and the Merger.

  

(b) If Moon elects to effect the Distribution in the form of a One-Step Spin-
Off, then the Board of Directors of Moon (or a committee thereof), in
accordance with applicable Law, shall establish (or designate Persons to
establish) a Record Date and the Distribution Date, and Moon shall establish
appropriate procedures in connection with, and to effectuate in accordance
with applicable Law, the Distribution. All shares of SpinCo Common Stock held
by Moon on the Distribution Date shall be distributed to the holders of record
of Moon Ordinary Shares in the manner determined by Moon and in accordance
with _Section 3.3(f)_. To the extent the Distribution is effected as a One-
Step Spin-Off, subject to the terms thereof, in accordance with _Section
3.3(f)_ , each holder of Moon Ordinary Shares on the Record Date shall be
entitled to receive for each Moon Ordinary Share held by such holder on the
Record Date a number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock equal to (i) the total
number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock held by Moon on the Distribution Date,
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Moon Ordinary Shares held by such holder on the Record Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of shares of Moon Ordinary Shares
outstanding on the Record Date.

  

(c) If Moon elects to effect the Distribution as an Exchange Offer, Moon shall
determine the terms of such Exchange Offer, including the number of shares of
SpinCo Common Stock that will be offered for each validly tendered share of
Moon Ordinary Shares, the period during which such Exchange Offer shall remain
open and any extensions thereto, the procedures for the tender and exchange of
shares and all other terms and conditions of such Exchange Offer, which terms
and conditions shall comply with the terms of the Merger Agreement and all
securities Law requirements applicable to such Exchange Offer. In the event
that Moon's stockholders subscribe for less than all of the SpinCo Common
Stock in the Exchange Offer, all shares of SpinCo Common Stock held by Moon
that are not exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be distributed as a
dividend to Moon stockholders on a pro rata basis on the Distribution Date and
immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer (the "Clean-Up
Spin-Off"), so that Moon will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as having distributed all of the shares of SpinCo Common Stock to the Moon
stockholders. To the extent the Distribution is effected as an Exchange Offer,
subject to the terms thereof, in accordance with _Section 3.3(f)_ , each Moon
stockholder may elect in the Exchange Offer to exchange a number of Moon
Ordinary Shares held by such Moon stockholder for shares of SpinCo Common
Stock. The terms and conditions of any Clean-Up Spin-Off will be as determined
by Moon, subject to the provisions of _Section 3.3(b)_ , mutatis mutandis.

  

(d) None of the Parties, nor any of their Affiliates hereto shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any shares of SpinCo Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions

  

 

40  

  

with respect thereto) that are properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(e) Moon, SpinCo, or the Distribution Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any provision of
local or foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the Persons otherwise entitled thereto.

  

(f) Upon the consummation of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer, Moon
shall deliver to the Distribution Agent, a global certificate representing the
SpinCo Common Stock being distributed in the One-Step Spin-Off or exchanged in
the Exchange Offer, as the case may be, for the account of the Moon
stockholders that are entitled thereto and shall take all such other actions
(including delivering any other instruments of transfer required by applicable
law) as may be necessary to effect the Distribution. Upon a Clean-Up Spin-Off,
if any, Moon shall deliver to the Distribution Agent an additional global
certificate representing the SpinCo Common Stock being distributed in the
Clean-Up Spin-Off for the account of the Moon stockholders that are entitled
thereto and shall take all such other actions (including delivering any other
instruments of transfer required by applicable law) as may be necessary to
effect the Distribution. The Distribution Agent shall hold such certificate or
certificates, as the case may be, for the account of the Moon stockholders
pending the Merger, as provided in Section 3.2 of the Merger Agreement.

  

Immediately after the Distribution Time and prior to the Effective Time, the
shares of SpinCo Common Stock shall not be transferable and the transfer agent
for the SpinCo Common Stock shall not transfer any shares of SpinCo Common
Stock; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the exchange of such shares
of SpinCo Common Stock for shares of Clover Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger shall not be deemed a transfer subject to the foregoing restrictions.
The Distribution shall be deemed to be effective upon written authorization
from Moon to the Distribution Agent to proceed.

  

Section 3.4 _Authorization of SpinCo Common Stock to Accomplish the
Distribution_. Prior to the Distribution, Moon and SpinCo shall take all
necessary action required to increase the number of authorized shares of
SpinCo Common Stock so that the SpinCo Common Stock then issued and
outstanding shall equal the number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock necessary
to effect the Distribution.

  

ARTICLE IV

  

ACCESS TO INFORMATION

  

Section 4.1 _Access to Information_.

  

(a) Other than for matters related to the provision of Tax records (in which
event the provision of the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern) until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Distribution Date (or such longer period as such
access by a Party is required under

  

 

41  

  

applicable Law), subject to _Section 7.2_ , each of Moon and SpinCo, on behalf
of its respective Group, agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to the
other Group and its Representatives, as soon as reasonably practicable after
written request therefor, any Information in the possession or under the
control of such respective Group which the requesting Party reasonably needs
to (i) comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed
on the requesting Party (including under applicable securities Laws) by a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting Party, (ii)
carry out its human resources functions or to establish, assume or administer
its benefit plans or payroll functions, (iii) use in any judicial, regulatory,
administrative or other Proceeding, in each case other than Adversarial
Actions, (iv) satisfy financial or statutory audit, accounting or other
similar requirements or (v) comply with its obligations (or confirm compliance
by the other Parties with their obligations) under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including with respect to the
completion of the Reorganization after the date of this Agreement); _provided_
that in the case of Information reasonably requested by a Party to satisfy its
financial and statutory audit requirements, the access contemplated by this
_Section 4.1(a)_ shall extend until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
Distribution Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that any Party
determines that any such provision of Information includes trade secrets or
other commercially sensitive Information or could violate any Law, or breach
any written Contract or waive any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-
product protection or other applicable privilege or immunity, the Parties
shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that avoids any such detriment or consequence.

  

(b) Other than for matters related to the provision of Tax records (in which
event the provision of the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern) until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Distribution Date (or such longer period as such
access by SpinCo is required under applicable Law), subject to _Section 7.2_ ,
(i) SpinCo and its Representatives shall have access during regular business
hours (as in effect from time to time) to any Information that relates to the
SpinCo Business retained by or in the possession of any member of the Moon
Group and (ii) SpinCo may obtain copies (but not originals unless it is a
SpinCo Asset) of documents for bona fide business purposes. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to restrict the access of any member of the Moon Group to any
such documents or to impose any liability on any member of the Moon Group if
any such documents are not maintained or preserved by Moon.

  

(c) Other than for matters related to the provision of Tax records (in which
event the provision of the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern), until the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Distribution Date (or such longer period as
such access by Moon is required under applicable Law), subject to _Section
7.2_ , (i) Moon and its Representatives shall have access during regular
business hours (as in effect from time to time) to any Information that
relates to the Moon Business retained by or in the possession of any member of
the SpinCo Group and (ii) Moon may obtain copies (but not originals unless it
is not a SpinCo Asset) of documents for bona fide business purposes. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to restrict the access of any member of the SpinCo
Group to any such documents or to impose any liability on any member of the
SpinCo Group if any such documents are not maintained or preserved by SpinCo.

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until the second (2nd)
Moon fiscal year-end occurring after the Distribution Date, each of Moon and
SpinCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
other Party's Information requests to

  

 

42  

  

enable (i) the other Party (and in the case of SpinCo, Clover) to meet its
timetable for dissemination of its earnings releases, financial statements and
management's assessment of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and
procedures and its internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with Items 307 and 308, respectively, of Regulation S-K; (ii) the other
Party's (and in the case of SpinCo, Clover's) accountants to timely complete
their review of the quarterly financial statements and audit of the annual

including, to the extent applicable to such Party (and in the case of SpinCo,
Clover), its auditor's audit of its internal control over financial reporting
and management's assessment thereof in accordance with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC's and Public Company Accounting

other Party (and in the case of SpinCo, Clover) to respond to any request or
official comment from a Governmental Authority, including in connection with
responding to a comment letter from, or investigation by, the SEC; _provided_
that in connection with this clause (iii), each Party shall provide reasonable
access on the terms set forth in this _Section 4.1(d)_ only until the matter
relating to such comment letter or investigation is resolved.

  

Section 4.2 _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by one Group
that is provided to a requesting Party pursuant to _Section 4.1_ shall be
deemed to remain the property of the providing Party, except where such

construed as granting or conferring rights of license or otherwise in any
Information requested or provided pursuant to _Section 4.1_.

(a) To facilitate the possible exchange of Information pursuant to this

accordance with the document retention policies of Moon or, in the case of
SpinCo, Clover in effect as of the Distribution Time (including any
Information that is subject to a "Litigation Hold" issued by either Party
prior to the Distribution Time) or such other document retention policies as

until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations and as otherwise

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Party will destroy, or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information contemplated by
_Section 4.1(a)_ without first offering to deliver such Information to the
other Party, at the other Party's cost and expense; _provided_ that (i) in the
case of any Information relating to a pending or threatened Action that is
known to a member of the Group in possession of such Information, the Parties
shall comply

  

 

43  

  

with the requirements of the applicable "Litigation Hold" ( _provided_ that
with respect to any pending or threatened Action arising after the
Distribution Time, the requirements of this _clause (i)_ shall apply only to
the extent that the member of the Moon Group or the SpinCo Group that is in
possession of such Information has been notified in writing pursuant to a
"Litigation Hold" of such pending or threatened Action); and (ii) in no event
shall a Party destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any
Information required to be retained by applicable Law.

  

(c) In the event of either Party's or any of its Subsidiaries' inadvertent
failure to comply with its applicable document retention policies as required
under this _Section 4.4_ , such Party shall be liable to the other Party
solely for the amount of any monetary fines or penalties imposed or levied
against such other Party by a Governmental Authority (which fines or penalties
shall not include any Liabilities asserted in connection with the claims
underlying the applicable Action, other than fines or penalties resulting from
any claim of spoliation) as a result of such other Party's inability to
produce Information caused by such inadvertent failure and, notwithstanding
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ , shall not be liable to such other Party for
any other Liabilities in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Party shall have any Liability to any other Party if any Information is
destroyed, _provided_ that such Party has used its reasonable best efforts to
comply with _Section 4.4(a)_ and _Section 4.4(b)_.

  

Section 4.5 _Liability for Information Provided_. No Party shall have any
Liability to any other Party in the event that any Information exchanged or

Action_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 4.1_ , from and after
the Distribution Time, except in the case of an adversarial Action by one
Party against another Party, each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to
make available to each other Party, upon written request, the former, current
and future directors, officers, employees and other Representatives of the
members of its respective Group as witnesses, and any books, records or other
Information within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available, to the extent that any such Person (giving consideration to
business demands of such directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives) or books, records or other Information may reasonably be
required in connection with any Action in which the requesting Party may from
time to time be involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with
respect to which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement. The
requesting Party shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection
therewith (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the costs and
benefits of employees who are witnesses or any pro rata portion of overhead or
other cost of employing such employees which would have been incurred by such
employees' employer regardless of the employees' service as witnesses).

  

 

44  

  

(b) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
_Section 4.7_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses officers
without regard to whether the witness or the employer of the witness could
assert a possible business conflict, except in the case of an adversarial
Action by one Party against another Party.

  

(c) In connection with any matter contemplated by this _Section 4.7_ , the
Parties will enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement so as to
maintain to the extent practicable any applicable attorney-client privilege,
work product immunity or other applicable privileges or immunities of any
member of any Group.

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 4.7_ are in
furtherance of the provisions of _Section 4.1_ and shall not be deemed to
limit the Parties' rights and obligations under _Section 4.1_.

  

Section 4.8 _Counsel; Privileges; Legal Materials_.

  

(a) In-house lawyers employed by Moon and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Distribution Time (" _Existing Moon Counsel_ ") have provided legal services
to and jointly represented Moon and its Subsidiaries, including members of the
Moon Group and the SpinCo Group. From and after the Distribution Time, certain
Existing Moon Counsel will remain employees of one or more members of the Moon
Group and provide legal services to and represent only the Moon Group (" _Moon
Counsel_ "), and certain Existing Moon Counsel will become employees of one or
more members of the SpinCo Group and provide legal services to and represent
only the SpinCo Group (" _SpinCo Counsel_ "). From and after the Distribution
Time, (i) Moon Counsel will represent only the Moon Group; (ii) SpinCo Counsel
will represent only the SpinCo Group; and (iii) SpinCo Counsel and Moon
Counsel will, subject to rules of professional responsibility respecting
obligations to former clients, owe a duty of loyalty and other professional
obligations only to their respective clients. The Parties have previously been
jointly represented by the Existing Moon Counsel in various legal matters of
common interest. This joint representation included in its scope all matters
prior to the Distribution Time in which a Party or another member of its Group
was represented by any of the Existing Moon Counsel.

  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection and expectation of client confidentiality
with respect to any Information concerning general business matters related to
the SpinCo Business and members of the SpinCo Group prior to the Distribution
(excluding any Information concerning any proposed sale, spin-off or other
disposition of the SpinCo Business or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in
lieu of any of the foregoing) (collectively, " _General SpinCo Business
Information_ ") shall be subject to a joint privilege and protection between
the members of the Moon Group, on the one hand, and the members of the SpinCo
Group, on the other hand. Moon and the members of the SpinCo Group shall have
equal right and obligation to assert such joint privilege and protection, and
no such joint privilege or protection may be waived by (i) Moon without the
prior written consent of SpinCo or (ii) any member of the SpinCo Group without
the prior written consent of Moon; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such
privileged communications or attorney-work product, whether arising prior to
or after the Distribution Date, with respect to any matter for which a Party
has an

  

 

45  

  

indemnification obligation hereunder, shall be subject to the sole control of
such Party, which shall be solely entitled to control the assertion or waiver
of the privilege or protection.

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection and expectation of client confidentiality
with respect to (i) any Information concerning any proposed sale, spin-off or
other disposition of the SpinCo Business or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document or
in lieu of any of the foregoing, and (ii) any Information other than General
SpinCo Business Information, shall in each case be retained and controlled
only by Moon and may be waived only by Moon. SpinCo acknowledges and agrees,
on behalf of itself and each member of the SpinCo Group, that (i) the
foregoing attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection and
expectation of client confidentiality shall not be controlled, owned, used,
waived or claimed by any member of the SpinCo Group at any time after the
Distribution Time; and (ii) in the event of a dispute between any member of
the SpinCo Group and a third party or any other circumstance in which a third
party requests or demands that any member of the SpinCo Group produce
privileged materials or attorney work-product of any member of the Moon Group
(including the privileged communications and attorney work-product covered by
this _Section 4.8_ ), SpinCo shall (A) cause such member of the SpinCo Group
to assert such privilege or protection on behalf of the applicable member of
the Moon Group to prevent disclosure of privileged communications or attorney
work-product to such third party and (B) promptly notify Moon of the existence
of any such request or demand and shall provide SpinCo a reasonable
opportunity to review the privileged materials or attorney work-product and to
assert any rights it or they may have, under this _Section 4.8_ or otherwise,
to prevent the production or disclosure of such privileged materials or
attorney work-product; provided that if SpinCo is prohibited by applicable Law
from disclosing the existence of such request or demand, SpinCo shall provide
written notice of such related information for which disclosure is not
prohibited by applicable Law and use reasonable best efforts to inform Moon of
any related information SpinCo reasonably determines is necessary or
appropriate for Moon to be informed of to enable Moon to review the privileged
materials or attorney work-product and to assert its rights, under this
_Section 4.8_ or otherwise, to prevent the production or disclosure of such
privileged materials or attorney work-product.

  

(d) The Parties agree that the Reorganization and Distribution shall not waive
or affect any applicable privileges, including the attorney-client privilege,
the attorney work product doctrine, the common interest privilege and the
joint-client/joint representation privilege. No Party may waive any privilege
that could be asserted under any applicable Law and in which the other Party
has joint privilege in accordance with the terms of this _Section 4.8_ ,
without the prior written consent of the other Party. If any dispute arises
between Moon and SpinCo, or any members of their respective Groups, regarding
whether joint privilege should be waived, each Party (i) shall negotiate with
the other Party in good faith and (ii) in furtherance and not in limitation of
_Section 4.8(b)_ , shall endeavor to minimize any prejudice to the rights of
the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, each Party shall be permitted to
withhold its consent to the waiver of a privilege for the purpose of
protecting its own legitimate interests.

  

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 4.8(b)_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
as between the Moon Group and the SpinCo Group (as constituted as of
immediately before the Distribution) Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison
LLP, Arthur Cox and Existing Moon

  

 

46  

  

Counsel (together, " _Counsel_ ") represented, for times prior to the
Distribution, only Moon and not any member of the SpinCo Group.
Notwithstanding _Section 4.8(b)_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
any advice given by or communications with Counsel prior to the Distribution
shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by Moon,
(ii) any advice given by or communications with Counsel (to the extent such
advice or communications relate to any proposed sale, spin-off or other
disposition of the SpinCo Business or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Document) shall
not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by Moon, and
(iii) no member of the SpinCo Group (as of immediately before the
Distribution) has the status of a client of Counsel as a result of advice
given by or communications with Counsel prior to the Distribution, for
conflict of interest or any other purposes. Moon and SpinCo (for itself and on
behalf of each member of the SpinCo Group and, after the Effective Time,
Clover and each Subsidiary of Clover) hereby agree that, in the event that any
Adversarial Action, or any other matter in which the interests of Moon, its
Affiliates and its direct and indirect equityholders, on the one hand, and the
SpinCo Group or, after the Effective Time, the Clover Group, on the other
hand, are adverse, arises after the Effective Time between the SpinCo Group
or, after the Effective Time, the Clover Group, on the one hand, and Moon, its
Affiliates and its direct and indirect equityholders, on the other hand, Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP and Arthur Cox in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby may represent Moon, its Affiliates and its
direct and indirect equityholders in such dispute, even though the interests
of Moon, its Affiliates and its direct and indirect equityholders may be
directly adverse to one or more members of the SpinCo Group or, after the
Effective Time, the Clover Group.

  

(f) In furtherance of the Parties' agreement under this _Section 4.8_ , Moon
and SpinCo shall, and shall cause applicable members of their respective Group
to, maintain their respective separate and joint privileges, including by
executing joint defense and common interest agreements where necessary or
useful for this purpose.

  

(g) The transfer of all Information pursuant to this Agreement is made in
reliance on the agreement of Moon and SpinCo set forth in this _Section 4.8_
and in _Section 7.2_ to maintain the confidentiality of privileged Information
and to assert and maintain all applicable privileges. The Parties agree that
their respective rights to any access to Information, witnesses and other
Persons, the furnishing of notices and documents and other cooperative efforts
between the Parties contemplated by this Agreement and the transfer of
privileged Information between the Parties and members of their respective
Groups pursuant to this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver of any
privilege (including but not limited to the attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, and any other applicable privilege or
immunity) that has been or may be asserted under this Agreement or otherwise.

47  

  

successors and assigns, and all Persons who at any time prior to the

(collectively, the " _Moon Released Persons_ "), from any and all Liabilities
whatsoever, whether at Law or in equity (including any right of contribution),
whether arising under any Contract, by operation of Law or otherwise, to the
extent existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to
occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur or any conditions
existing or alleged to have existed at or prior to the Distribution Time,
including in connection with the transactions and all other activities to
implement the Reorganization, the Distribution, the Merger and any of the

includes a release of any rights and benefits with respect to such Liabilities
that SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group, and their respective successors
and assigns, now has or in the future may have conferred upon them by virtue
of any statute or common law principle which provides that a general release
does not extend to claims which a party does not know or suspect to exist in
its favor at the time of executing the release, if knowledge of such claims
would have materially affected such party's settlement with the obligor. In
this connection, SpinCo hereby acknowledges that it is aware that factual
matters now unknown to it may have given or may hereafter give rise to
Liabilities that are presently unknown, unanticipated and unsuspected, and it
further agrees that this release has been negotiated and agreed upon in light
of that awareness and it nevertheless hereby intends to release the Moon
Released Persons from the Liabilities described in the first sentence of this
_Section 5.1(a)_.

  

(b) Except as provided in _Section 5.1(c)_ , effective as of the Distribution

managers, officers, agents or employees of any member of the Moon Group (in
each case, in their respective capacities as such), remise, release and
forever discharge SpinCo, the respective members of the SpinCo Group, their
respective successors and assigns, and all Persons who at any time prior to
the Distribution Time have been directors, officers, agents or employees of
any member of the SpinCo Group (in each case, in their respective capacities
as such), and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns (collectively, the " _SpinCo Released Persons_ "), from any and
all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at Law or in equity (including any right
of contribution), whether arising under any Contract, by operation of Law or
otherwise, to the extent existing or arising from any acts or events occurring
or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur or
any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or prior to the
Distribution Time, including in connection with the transactions and all other
activities to implement the Reorganization, the Distribution and any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the Merger Agreement. Without limitation, the foregoing release
includes a release of any rights and benefits with respect to such Liabilities
that Moon or any member of the Moon Group, and their respective successors and
assigns, now has or in the future may have conferred upon them by virtue of
any statute or common law principle

  

 

48  

  

which provides that a general release does not extend to claims which a party
does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of executing the
release, if knowledge of such claims would have materially affected such
party's settlement with the obligor. In this connection, Moon hereby
acknowledges that it is aware that factual matters now unknown to it may have
given or may hereafter give rise to Liabilities that are presently unknown,
unanticipated and unsuspected, and it further agrees that this release has
been negotiated and agreed upon in light of that awareness and it nevertheless
hereby intends to release the SpinCo Released Persons from the Liabilities
described in the first sentence of this _Section 5.1(b)_.

  

(c) Nothing contained in _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.1(b)_ shall impair or
otherwise impact any right of any Party, and as applicable, any member of such
Party's Group, to enforce this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
the Merger Agreement or any other Contracts that are specified in _Section
2.6(b)_ as not terminating as of the Distribution Time, in each case in
accordance with its terms. Nothing contained in _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section
5.1(b)_ shall release any Person from:

  

(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from (A) this Agreement (including
the indemnification and contribution obligation under _Article VI_ ) or any
other Transaction Document, (B) the Merger Agreement or (C) any Contract among
any members of the Moon Group or the SpinCo Group that is specified in
_Section 2.6(b)_ as not terminating as of the Distribution Time or any other
Liability specified in _Section 2.6(b)_ as not terminating as of the
Distribution Time;

  

(ii) any Liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred, assigned or
allocated to the Group of which such Person is a member in accordance with, or
any other Liability of any member of any Group under, this Agreement, any
other Transaction Document or the Merger Agreement;

  

(iii) any Liability for the sale, lease, construction or receipt of goods,

respect thereof);

  

(iv) any Liability that the Parties may have with respect to indemnification
or contribution pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise for claims brought
against the Parties by third Persons, which Liability shall be governed by the
provisions of _Article VI_ and, if applicable, the appropriate provisions of
the other Transaction Documents or the Merger Agreement; or

  

(v) any Liability the release of which would result in the release of any
Person other than the Persons released pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)_ and

In addition, nothing contained in _Section 5.1(a)_ shall release: (A) Moon or
any of its Subsidiaries from indemnifying any director, officer, manager or
employee of the SpinCo Group who was a director, officer or employee of Moon
or such Subsidiary at or prior to the Distribution Time, to the extent such
director, officer, manager or employee is or becomes a named defendant in any
Action with respect to which he or she was entitled to such indemnification
from a member of

  

 

49  

  

the Moon Group pursuant to then-existing obligations, _it_ _being_
_understood_ that if the underlying obligation giving rise to such Action is a
SpinCo Liability, SpinCo shall indemnify Moon for such Liability (including
Moon's costs to indemnify the director, officer or employee) in accordance
with the provisions set forth in _Article VI_ ; and (B) SpinCo or any of its
Subsidiaries from indemnifying any director, officer, manager, or employee of
the Moon Group who was a director, officer, manager or employee of Moon or
such Subsidiary at or prior to the Distribution Time, to the extent such
director, officer, manager or employee is or becomes a named defendant in any
Action with respect to which he or she was entitled to such indemnification
from a member of the SpinCo Group pursuant to then-existing obligations,
except to the extent such obligation is an Excluded Liability hereunder ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ that if the underlying obligation giving rise to such
Action is an Excluded Liability, Moon shall indemnify SpinCo for such
Liability (including SpinCo's costs to indemnify the director, officer or
employee) in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Article VI_).

  

(d) Following the Distribution, SpinCo shall not make, and shall not permit
any member of the SpinCo Group to make, any claim or demand, or commence any
Action asserting any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or

occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to

ARTICLE VI

  

INDEMNIFICATION, GUARANTEES AND LITIGATION

  

Section 6.1 _General Indemnification by SpinCo_. Without limiting or otherwise
affecting the indemnity provisions of the other Transaction Documents, from
and after the Effective Time, SpinCo shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each member of the Moon Group, each of Moon's Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Moon Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Liabilities of the
Moon Indemnified Parties to the extent relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any of the following items (without duplication) (collectively,
the " _SpinCo Indemnification Obligations_ "):

  

 

50  

  

(a) any SpinCo Liability;

  

(b) the failure of SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group or any other
Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any SpinCo Liabilities,
whether prior to, at or after the Effective Time;

  

(c) any breach by any member of the SpinCo Group of this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents (other than Transaction Documents that
expressly contain indemnification provisions, which shall be subject to the
indemnification provisions contained therein, and excluding any provision that
by its terms does not survive the Effective Time) after the Effective Time;
and

  

(d) any Specified Asbestos Liability.

  

Section 6.2 _General Indemnification by Moon_. Without limiting or otherwise
affecting the indemnity provisions of the other Transaction Documents, from
and after the Effective Time, Moon shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each member of the SpinCo Group, each of SpinCo's Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_SpinCo Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all Liabilities of
the SpinCo Indemnified Parties to the extent relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any of the following items (without duplication) (collectively,
the " _Moon Indemnification Obligations_ "):

  

(a) any Excluded Liability (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any Specified
Asbestos Liability);

  

(b) the failure of Moon, any other member of the Moon Group, any member of the
SpinCo Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly
discharge any Excluded Liabilities, whether prior to, at or after the
Distribution Time; and

  

(c) any breach by any member of (i) the SpinCo Group prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) the Moon Group of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents (other than Transaction Documents that expressly contain
indemnification provisions, which shall be subject to the indemnification
provisions contained therein, and excluding any provision that by its terms
does not survive the Effective Time).

  

Section 6.3 _Contribution_. If the indemnification otherwise provided for in
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ is, as a matter of Law, unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Party in respect of such
Liabilities for which they would otherwise be indemnified hereunder (and for
which indemnification would otherwise be provided hereunder), then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Indemnified Party in respect of such non-indemnified Liabilities in proportion
to the relative fault and benefit of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party. Solely for purposes of determining relative fault pursuant
to this _Section 6.3_ : (a) any fault associated with the conduct of the Moon
Business prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be allocated to Moon
and the other members of the Moon Group, and no such fault shall be deemed to
be the fault of SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group; and (b) any
fault associated with the conduct of the SpinCo Business prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be the fault of SpinCo and the other members
of the SpinCo

  

 

51  

  

Group, and no such fault shall be deemed to be the fault of Moon or any other
member of the Moon Group.

  

Section 6.4 _Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other
Amounts_.

  

(a) Any Liability subject to indemnification or contribution pursuant to this
_Article VI_ will be net of Insurance Proceeds received by the Indemnified
Party that actually reduce the amount of the Liability. Accordingly, the
amount which any Party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") is required to pay to any
Person entitled to indemnification or contribution under this _Article VI_ (an
" _Indemnified Party_ ") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore
actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of the
related Liability. If an Indemnified Party receives a payment (an " _Indemnity
Payment_ ") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect
of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds in respect of
such Liability, then the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party
an amount equal to such Insurance Proceeds but not exceeding the amount of the
Indemnity Payment paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Liability.

  

(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be
relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or have any subrogation
rights with respect thereto solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions
of this Agreement. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to seek to collect or recover any third-party Insurance Proceeds to
which the Indemnified Party is entitled in connection with any Liability for
which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VI_ ; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party's ability or inability to collect
or recover any such Insurance Proceeds shall not limit the Indemnifying
Party's obligations under this Agreement.

  

(c) Subject to Section 6.7(c), any indemnity payment under this Article VI
shall be decreased to take into account any actual reduction in Taxes
otherwise payable by the Indemnified Party during or prior to the taxable year
in which the indemnification payment is made or during the two subsequent
taxable years, arising from the incurrence of such indemnified Liability.
Solely for purposes of this Section 6.4(c), the term "Indemnified Party" shall
include any member of such Indemnified Party's affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group.

  

Section 6.5 _Certain Matters Relating to Indemnification of Third-Party
Claims_.

  

(a) Notice of Third-Party Claim. If an Indemnified Party receives written
notice that a Person (including any Governmental Authority) that is not a
member of the Moon Group or the SpinCo Group has asserted any claim or
commenced any Action (other than any such claim or Action that is governed by
the Tender Agreement) that may implicate an Indemnifying Party's obligation to
indemnify pursuant to _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ , or any other Section of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (collectively, a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party
written notice thereof as promptly as practicable (and no later than twenty
(20) days) after becoming aware of the Third-Party Claim. Such notice shall
describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and include copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party

  

 

52  

  

relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure
of an Indemnified Party to provide notice in accordance with this _Section
6.5(a)_ shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure
to provide notice in accordance with this _Section 6.5(a)_.

  

(b) Subrogation. To the extent an indemnification or contribution payment is
made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party in
connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any
right, defense or claim which such Indemnified Party may have relating to such
Third-Party Claim. Subject to _Section 6.10_ , such Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost
and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right,
defense or claim.

  

(c) Defense of Claims. Other than in the case of any Liability being managed
by a Party in accordance with any other Transaction Document or in the case of
a Mixed Action (which shall be managed in accordance with _Section 6.10(d)_ ),
an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to assume,
control the defense of, and settle any Third-Party Claim, at such Indemnifying
Party's own cost and expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel,
which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the applicable Indemnified
Parties, if it gives written notice of its intention to do so and agreement
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this _Article
VI_ to the applicable Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) calendar days of
the receipt of notice from such Indemnified Parties of the Third-Party Claim.
After such notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified
Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in
(but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, at its own
expense and, in any event, shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all
witnesses and all pertinent and material Information and materials in such
Indemnified Party's possession or under such Indemnified Parties' control
relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not require the Indemnified
Parties to disclose any Information the disclosure of which would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Parties, result in the loss of any
existing attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other
applicable privilege or immunity with respect to such Information or violate
any applicable Law ( _provided_ that the Indemnified Parties that would
otherwise be required to disclose Information shall take any and all
reasonable action necessary to permit such disclosure without such loss of
privilege, protection or immunity or violation of Law).

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5_ or _Section
6.10_ , in the event that (i) an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, (ii) there exists a conflict
of interest or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the applicable Indemnified Party, (iii) any Third-Party Claim seeks an
order, injunction or other equitable relief, relief for other than money
damages against the Indemnified Party or asserts any criminal wrongdoing
(excluding de minimis equitable relief incidental to the award of money
damages), (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel within
thirty (30) calendar days after notice from the Indemnified Party of such
Third-Party Claim, (v) the Indemnified Party's exposure to Liability in
connection with such Third-

  

 

53  

  

Party Claim is reasonably expected to exceed the Indemnifying Party's exposure
in respect of such Third-Party Claim taking into account the indemnification
obligations hereunder or (vi) the party making such Third-Party Claim is a
Governmental Authority with regulatory authority over the Indemnified Party or
any of its material Assets, such Indemnified Party(ies) shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, with counsel of such Indemnified Party's choosing. If the Indemnified
Party is conducting the defense against any such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party all witnesses and all
pertinent and material Information and materials in such Indemnifying Party's
possession or under such Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as are
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access shall not require the Indemnifying Party to disclose any
Information the disclosure of which would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnifying Party, result in the loss of any existing attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or other applicable privilege or
immunity with respect to such Information or violate any applicable Law (
_provided_ that the Indemnified Parties that would otherwise be required to
disclose Information shall take any and all reasonable action necessary to
permit such disclosure without such loss of privilege, protection or immunity
or violation of Law).

  

(d) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be authorized to settle or
compromise or consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third-Party Claims unless such settlement,
compromise or entry of judgment (A) shall not encumber any of the Assets of
any Indemnified Party or contain any restriction or condition that would apply
to such Indemnified Party or to the conduct of that Person's business (other
than the payment of money), (B) does not result in any non-monetary remedy or
relief being imposed upon the Indemnified Party, (C) does not contain or
otherwise involve an admission or statement providing for or acknowledging any
liability or criminal wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, and (D) contains as a condition thereto, a complete release of
the Indemnified Party. No settlement or entry of judgment in respect of any
Third-Party Claim shall be consented to by any Indemnified Party without the
express written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Moon shall not be
required to indemnify any SpinCo Indemnified Party for any Liability pursuant
to _Section 6.2_ if and to the extent such Liability was reflected in the
calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount.

  

Section 6.6 _Additional Matters_.

  

(a) Indemnification or contribution payments in respect of any Liabilities for
which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or contribution
under this _Article VI_ shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the
Indemnified Party, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting
forth the basis for the amount of such payment (including where reasonably
practicable an itemization of costs and expenses, attorney invoices and
supporting documentation from other vendors in the form reviewed by the
Indemnified Party, and any applicable orders, judgments or settlement
agreements). The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
_Article VI_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless
of (i) any investigation made by or

  

 

54  

  

on behalf of any Indemnified Party or (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnified
Party of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to indemnification or
contribution under this Agreement.

  

(b) Any claim for indemnification under this _Article VI_ other than in
respect of a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that the failure
to so notify an Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been
actually prejudiced by such failure. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a
period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice to respond
thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty
(30)-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to
accept responsibility for such indemnification obligation. If such
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period or
rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified Party shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to such Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, as applicable, without
prejudice to its continuing rights to pursue indemnification or contribution
under this Agreement.

  

(c) Except as otherwise agreed between Moon and SpinCo, all indemnification
payments under this Agreement shall be made by Moon LuxCo to the SpinCo
Borrower and by the SpinCo Borrower to Moon LuxCo. For U.S. federal (and
applicable state, local and foreign) income tax purposes, each of Moon and
SpinCo agrees to treat, and to cause its Subsidiaries to treat, (i) any
payment required by this Agreement (other than payments of interest) as either
a contribution by Moon LuxCo to the SpinCo Borrower or a distribution by the
SpinCo Borrower to Moon LuxCo, as the case may be, occurring immediately prior
to the Distribution or as a payment of an assumed or retained Liability; and
(ii) any payment of interest as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to
the Party entitled under this Agreement to retain such payment or required
under this Agreement to make such payment, in each case, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law or a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law).

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any
Party have any Liability pursuant to this Agreement for any lost profits or
opportunity costs, or any special, punitive or consequential damages (except
in any such case to the extent assessed in connection with a Third Party Claim
or except in the case of consequential damages to the extent such damages are
the reasonable and foreseeable result of the matter in question).

  

Section 6.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The indemnification provisions of this
_Article VI_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of an Indemnified Party
for any monetary or compensatory damages or losses for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating
to this Agreement (including with respect to the SpinCo Liabilities and the
Excluded Liabilities) or any other Transaction Document (other than
Transaction Documents that expressly provide otherwise) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
Parties hereby waives, for itself and its respective Affiliates, successors
and assigns, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims or remedies such Person may have against the other Party and
its Affiliates, successors and assigns for any monetary or compensatory
damages or losses for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement

  

 

55  

  

or any other Transaction Document (other than Transaction Documents that
expressly provide otherwise) or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article VI_.
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not affect (a) either Party's
right to seek specific performance under this Agreement as provided in
_Section 9.10_ and (b) either Party's right to exercise all of their rights
and seek all damages available to them under Law in the event of claims or
causes of action arising from fraud, and (c) any Transaction Document that
expressly contains indemnification provisions or other remedies, which shall
be subject to the indemnification or other remedy provisions contained therein
and not this _Article VI_.

  

Section 6.8 _Survival of Indemnities_. The rights and obligations of each of
Moon and SpinCo and their respective Indemnified Parties under this _Article
VI_ shall survive the sale or other transfer by any Party of any Assets or
businesses or the permitted assignment by it of any Liabilities.

  

Section 6.9 _Guarantees_.

  

(a) (i) Moon shall (with the reasonable cooperation of the applicable
member(s) of the SpinCo Group) use its reasonable efforts to have any
member(s) of the SpinCo Group removed as guarantor of or obligor for and
released from any Excluded Liability, and (ii) SpinCo shall (with the
reasonable cooperation of the applicable member(s) of the Moon Group) use its
reasonable efforts to have any member(s) of the Moon Group removed as
guarantor of or obligor for and released from any SpinCo Liability, including
in respect of those guarantees set forth on _Schedule 6.9(a)_ to the extent
that they relate to SpinCo Liabilities.

  

(b) To the extent required to obtain a removal or release from a guarantee
described in and in accordance with _Section 6.9(a)_ (a " _Guarantee Release_
"):

  

(i) of any member of the Moon Group, SpinCo or an appropriate member of the
SpinCo Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Moon,
on or prior to the Distribution Time (and, to the extent any guarantee remains
outstanding after the Distribution Time, for up to twelve (12) months after
the Distribution Time), valid and binding written unconditional releases of
Moon and its Subsidiaries (other than the members of the SpinCo Group), as
applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the
Distribution Date, under the applicable guarantee, which shall be effective as
of the Distribution Time, including by providing, as reasonably determined by
SpinCo and Clover, substitute guarantees, furnishing letters of credit,
instituting escrow arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds or making
other arrangements as the counterparty may reasonably request. SpinCo shall
coordinate with Moon with respect to its initial contact with such
beneficiaries, afford Moon a reasonable opportunity to participate in
discussions with such beneficiaries prior to engaging therein, and keep Moon
reasonably informed of any discussions with such beneficiaries in which Moon
does not participate.

  

(ii) of any member of the SpinCo Group, Moon or an appropriate member of the
Moon Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
SpinCo and Clover, on

  

 

56  

  

or prior to the Distribution Time (and, to the extent any guarantee remains
outstanding after the Distribution Time, for up to twelve (12) months after
the Distribution Time), valid and binding written unconditional releases of
SpinCo and its Subsidiaries (other than the members of the Moon Group), as
applicable, from any Liability, whether arising before, on or after the
Distribution Date, under the applicable guarantee, which shall be effective as
of the Distribution Time, including by providing, as reasonably determined by
Moon, substitute guarantees, furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow
arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds or making other arrangements
as the counterparty may reasonably request. Moon shall coordinate with SpinCo
and Clover with respect to its initial contact with such beneficiaries, afford
SpinCo and Clover a reasonable opportunity to participate in discussions with
such beneficiaries prior to engaging therein, and keep SpinCo and Clover
reasonably informed of any discussions with such beneficiaries in which SpinCo
and Clover do not participate.

  

(c) If Moon or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any
Guarantee Release, (i) the relevant member of the Moon Group or SpinCo Group,
as applicable, that has assumed the Liability with respect to such guarantee
shall indemnify and hold harmless the guarantor or obligor for any Liability
to the extent arising from or relating thereto in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VI_ and shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, as agent or subcontractor for such guarantor or obligor, pay,
perform and discharge fully all Excluded Liabilities or SpinCo Liabilities, as
applicable, of such guarantor or obligor thereunder and (ii) with respect to
such guarantee, each of Moon and SpinCo, on behalf of themselves and the
members of their respective Groups, agree not to renew or extend the term of,
increase its obligations under or transfer to a third Person, any loan,
guarantee, lease, contract or other obligation for which the other Party or
any member of the other Party's Group is liable under such guarantee unless
all obligations of the other Party and the other members of the other Party's
Group with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the other Party.

  

Section 6.10 _Management of Actions_. This _Section 6.10_ shall govern the
direction of pending and future Actions in which members of the SpinCo Group
or the Moon Group are named as parties (other than Actions governed by the
Tender Agreement, which shall be governed thereby and Indemnity Claims subject
to _Section 6.5_ unless otherwise expressly provided therein), but shall not
alter the allocation of Liabilities set forth in _Article II_ unless expressly
set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

  

(a) Management of SpinCo Controlled Actions. From and after the Distribution
Time, the SpinCo Group shall direct the defense or prosecution of, subject to
_Section 6.5(c)_ , any Actions that constitute only SpinCo Liabilities or
SpinCo Assets (" _SpinCo Controlled Actions_ "). If an Action that constitutes
solely a SpinCo Liability or a SpinCo Asset is commenced after the
Distribution Time naming a member of the Moon Group as a party thereto, then
SpinCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such member of
the Moon Group to be removed as a party to such Action. Except in the case of
an Adversarial Action, no Party shall add the other Party to any Action
pending as of or after the Distribution Time without the prior written consent
of the other Party.

  

(b) Management of Moon Controlled Actions. From and after the Distribution
Time, the Moon Group shall direct the defense or prosecution of, subject to
_Section 6.5(c)_ , any

  

 

57  

  

Actions that constitute only Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Assets (" _Moon
Controlled Actions_ "). If an Action that constitutes solely an Excluded
Liability or an Excluded Asset is commenced after the Distribution Time naming
a member of the SpinCo Group as a party thereto, then Moon shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such member of the SpinCo Group to be
removed as a party to such Action. Except in the case of an Adversarial
Action, no Party shall add the other Party to any Action pending as of or
after the Distribution Time without the prior written consent of the other
Party.

  

(c) Management of Actions Naming Both SpinCo and Moon. Subject to _Section
6.5(c)_ from and after the Distribution Time, in the event that one or more
member(s) of the SpinCo Group and one or more member(s) of the Moon Group is
named in an Action that is not a SpinCo Controlled Action, a Moon Controlled
Action nor a Mixed Action (a " _Separate Action_ "), each of SpinCo and Moon
shall be entitled to assume their own defense and select counsel of their own
choosing to defend their respective interests in such Separate Action. SpinCo
and Moon shall consult in good faith with each other regarding the management
of the defense of each Separate Action.

  

(d) Management of Mixed Actions. From and after the Distribution Time, (i) any
Action set forth on _Section 6.10(d)_ and (ii) any Action that constitutes
both a SpinCo Liability or a SpinCo Asset, on the one hand, and an Excluded
Liability or an Excluded Asset, on the other hand and that do not constitute a
SpinCo Controlled Action nor a Moon Controlled Action (clauses (i) and (ii), "
_Mixed Action_ ") shall be managed by the Party with the greater financial
exposure with respect thereto (taking into account the provisions of this
_Article VI_ ), as determined in good faith by the Parties; _provided_ that
any outside counsel employed by a Party managing the Action with respect
thereto shall be subject to the approval of other Party (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the Action involves the pursuit of any criminal sanctions or penalties
or seeks equitable or injunctive relief against only a Party or Subsidiary of
such Party, that Party shall be entitled to control the defense of the
applicable claims against such Party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
if, despite one Party having a greater financial exposure in respect of a
Mixed Action, the other Party reasonably considers that such Mixed Action will
be materially detrimental to its competitive or commercial business prospects
and wishes to manage such Action, the first Party with the greater financial
exposure shall consider in good faith the other Party's request for the second
mentioned Party to manage such Mixed Action. The Parties shall reasonably
cooperate and consult with each other, and to the extent necessary or
advisable, maintain a joint defense in a manner that would preserve for both
Parties and their respective Affiliates any attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection, joint defense or other privilege with
respect to Mixed Actions. The Party managing such Mixed Action shall on a
quarterly basis, or if a material development occurs as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, inform the other Party of the status of and
developments relating to any Mixed Action and provide copies of any material
document, notices or other materials related to such Mixed Action; _provided_
that the failure to provide any such Information shall not be a basis for
liability of a Party managing such Mixed Action except and solely to the
extent the other Party shall have been actually prejudiced thereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties may jointly
retain counsel (in which case the cost of counsel shall be shared equally by
the Parties) or retain separate counsel (in which case each Party will bear
the cost of its separate counsel) with respect to any Mixed Action; _provided_
that the Parties shall share discovery and other joint litigation costs in

  

 

58  

  

proportion to their respective expected financial exposure (in the case of
Actions that constitute both a SpinCo Liability and an Excluded Liability) or
respective expected financial recovery (in the case of Actions that constitute
both a SpinCo Asset and an Excluded Asset). In any Mixed Action, each of Moon
and SpinCo may pursue separate defenses, claims, counterclaims or settlements
to those claims relating to the Moon Business or the SpinCo Business,
respectively; _provided_ that each Party shall in good faith make all
reasonable efforts to avoid adverse effects on the other Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) if an adverse judgment is
obtained with respect to a Mixed Action, the Parties shall endeavor in good
faith to allocate the Liabilities in respect of such judgment between them
based on the proportion of such Liabilities attributable to the Moon Business
and the SpinCo Business; and (B) if a recovery is obtained with respect to a
Mixed Action, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to allocate the Assets
in respect of such recovery between them based on their respective injuries. A
Party that is not named as a defendant in a Mixed Action may elect to become a
party to such Mixed Action, and the Party named in such Mixed Action shall
reasonably cooperate to have such first Party named in such Mixed Action.

  

(e) Delegation of Rights of Recovery. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, the rights to recovery of each Party's Subsidiaries in respect
of any past, present or future Action are hereby delegated to such Party. It
is the intent of the Parties that the foregoing delegation shall satisfy any
Law requiring such delegation to be effected pursuant to a power of attorney
or similar instrument. The Parties and their respective Subsidiaries shall
execute such further instruments or documents as may be necessary to effect
such delegation.

  

Section 6.11 _Settlement of Actions_. No Party managing an Action pursuant to
_Section 6.10_ shall settle or compromise such Action (other than Moon with
respect to Moon Controlled Actions and SpinCo with respect to SpinCo
Controlled Actions, in each case, except as provided in _Section 6.5(e)_ )
without the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that if the Party managing the
Action is indemnifying the other Party, such managing Party may nevertheless
settle such Action in accordance with _Section 6.5(e)_.

(a) In addition to the actions provided for elsewhere in this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the Merger Agreement, each of the Parties
will cooperate with each other and shall (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to), prior to, at and after the Distribution Time, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary on its part under
applicable Law or Contracts to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing and except as otherwise provided in any
other Transaction Document, prior to, at and for twenty-four (24) months after
the Distribution

  

 

59  

  

Time, each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, without any further
consideration but from and after the Distribution Time at the expense of the
requesting Party, to execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and
delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment,
title and transfer, and use reasonable best efforts to obtain or make any
Approvals or Notifications from or with any Governmental Authority or any
other Person under any Permit, license, Contract or other instrument, and to
take all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take
by any other Party, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transfers of the
SpinCo Assets and the Excluded Assets and the assignment and assumption of the
SpinCo Liabilities and the Excluded Liabilities and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that except to the
extent expressly provided in _Section 7.4_ or in any of the other Transaction
Documents, neither Party shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ to
contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing
any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or commercial accommodation)
to any Person in order to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications.
Without limiting the foregoing, except to the extent otherwise provided in any
other Transaction Document, each Party will, at the reasonable request and
expense of the other Party, take such other actions as may be reasonably
necessary to vest in such other Party good and marketable title and rights to
the Assets allocated to such other Party under this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents, if and to the extent it is practicable to do so.

  

(c) At or prior to the Distribution Time, Moon and SpinCo in their respective
capacities as direct and indirect stockholders of their respective
Subsidiaries, shall each ratify any actions that are reasonably necessary or
desirable to be taken by their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

  

(d) Moon will inform and consult, or procure that its Subsidiaries inform and
consult, the relevant employee representative bodies that are required to be
informed and/or consulted as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law,
and where relevant and necessary the applicable members of the Moon Group or
SpinCo Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into collective
labor agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

Section 7.2 _Confidentiality_.

  

(a) From and after the Distribution Time, subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and
except as contemplated by this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
the Merger Agreement, Moon shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
including attorneys, advisors and other representatives of any Person
providing financing (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), not to, directly or
indirectly, disclose to any Person, other than Representatives of Moon or its
Affiliates who reasonably need to know such information in providing services
to any member of the Moon Group, or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of any third Person, any SpinCo Confidential
Information. If any disclosures are made in connection with providing services
to any member of the Moon Group under this Agreement, any other Transaction
Document or the Merger

  

 

60  

  

Agreement, then the SpinCo Confidential Information so disclosed shall be used
only as required to perform the services or as otherwise provided in an
applicable Transaction Document. Moon shall use the same degree of care to
prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the SpinCo Confidential
Information by any of its Representatives as it currently uses for its own
confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of
care. " _SpinCo Confidential Information_ " means any Information (i) to the
extent relating to the SpinCo Business (including any confidential or
proprietary Information included in the SpinCo Assets or SpinCo Contracts)
furnished to or otherwise in the possession of any member of the Moon Group,
including as a result of or in connection with the Reorganization or
Distribution or the performance of any Transaction Document or the Merger
Agreement or (ii) relating to Clover or its Affiliates furnished to any member
of the Moon Group pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, in each case,
irrespective of the form of communication, and all notes, analyses,
compilations, forecasts, data, translations, studies, memoranda or other
documents prepared by Moon, any member of the Moon Group or their respective
Representatives, to the extent they contain or otherwise reflect such
Information; _provided_ that SpinCo Confidential Information does not include,
and there shall be no obligation under this Agreement with respect to,
Information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other
than as a result of a disclosure by any member of the Moon Group or any of its
Representatives not otherwise permissible under this _Section 7.2_ , (ii) Moon
can demonstrate was or became available to Moon or any of its Representatives
after the Distribution Time from a source other than SpinCo or its
Representatives, _provided_ that such source was not known by Moon to be bound
by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to SpinCo
or any member of the SpinCo Group with respect to such Information, or (iii)
is developed independently by a member of the Moon Group or any of its
Representatives without use or reference to the SpinCo Confidential
Information.

  

(b) From and after the Distribution Time, subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and
except as contemplated by this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
the Merger Agreement, SpinCo shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, disclose to
any Person, other than Representatives of SpinCo or its Affiliates who
reasonably need to know such information in providing services to any member
of the SpinCo Group, or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for
the benefit of any third Person, any Moon Confidential Information. If any
disclosures are made in connection with providing services to any member of
the SpinCo Group under this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the
Merger Agreement, then the Moon Confidential Information so disclosed shall be
used only as required to perform the services. SpinCo shall use the same
degree of care to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Moon
Confidential Information by any of its Representatives as it currently uses
for its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable
standard of care. " _Moon Confidential Information_ " means any Information to
the extent relating to the Moon Business furnished to or otherwise in the
possession of any member of the SpinCo Group as a result of or in connection
with the Reorganization or Distribution or the performance of any Transaction
Document or the Merger Agreement, irrespective of the form of communication,
and all notes, analyses, compilations, forecasts, data, translations, studies,
memoranda or other documents prepared by SpinCo, any member of the SpinCo
Group or their respective Representatives, to the extent they contain or
otherwise reflect such Information; _provided_ that Moon Confidential
Information does not include, and there shall be no obligation under this
Agreement with respect to, Information

  

 

61  

  

that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a
result of a disclosure by any member of the SpinCo Group or any of its
Representatives not otherwise permissible under this _Section 7.2_ , (ii)
SpinCo can demonstrate was or became available to SpinCo or any of its
Representatives after the Distribution Time from a source other than Moon or
its Representatives; _provided_ that such source was not known by SpinCo to be
bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to
Moon or any member of the Moon Group with respect to such Information, or
(iii) is developed independently by a member of the SpinCo Group or any of its
Representatives without use or reference to the Moon Confidential Information.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 7.2(b)_ ,
Moon or its Representatives may disclose SpinCo Confidential Information, and
SpinCo and its Representatives may disclose Moon Confidential Information: (i)
to the extent such Party or such Representative is required or compelled to
disclose any such Moon Confidential Information or SpinCo Confidential
Information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law or stock exchange rule, (ii) as required in connection with any
Adversarial Action, (iii) as necessary in order to permit a Party to prepare
and disclose its financial statements in connection with any regulatory
filings or Tax Returns, (iv) as necessary for a Party to enforce its rights or
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or (v) to Governmental Authorities in accordance
with applicable procurement regulations and contract requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for
disclosure of Moon Confidential Information or SpinCo Confidential Information
is made pursuant to clause (i), (iii) or (v) above (other than with respect to
any such Information furnished pursuant to the provisions of _Article IV_ ),
as applicable, the Person receiving such request or demand or other disclosure
requirement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other
Party with written notice of such request or demand as promptly as practicable
so that such other Party shall have an opportunity to seek an appropriate
protective order. The Party receiving such request or demand shall take, and
cause its Representatives to take, at the requesting Party's expense, all
other reasonable steps necessary to obtain confidential treatment by the
recipient. Subject to the foregoing, the Party or any of its Representatives
that received such request or demand may thereafter disclose or provide any
SpinCo Confidential Information or Moon Confidential Information, as the case
may be, to the extent required by such Governmental Authority, stock exchange
or applicable Law (as so advised by counsel).

  

(d) Prior to the Distribution, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein but without prejudice to whether any such device would
constitute a SpinCo Asset, Moon shall be entitled to cause any Moon
Confidential Information to be removed from personal computers or other
devices owned or leased by Moon or any of its Subsidiaries and used by a
SpinCo Employee, including by replacing such device with a comparable device
not containing Moon Confidential Information. To the extent such process has
not been completed prior to the Distribution, SpinCo shall permit Moon to
affect such removals or exchanges within three months following the
Distribution Date, at Moon's cost.

  

Section 7.3 _Insurance Matters_.

  

 

62  

  

(a) From and after the Distribution Time, except as expressly provided herein,
the SpinCo Group and the SpinCo Business shall cease to be insured by Moon's
Insurance Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, Moon shall retain all rights
to control its Insurance Policies, including the right to exhaust, settle,
release, or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its Insurance
Policies notwithstanding whether any such Insurance Policies apply to any
Liabilities of any member of the SpinCo Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Moon shall take no action to commute, buy back or otherwise modify any
Insurance Policy to which SpinCo is entitled to rights pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)(vii)_ , in a manner that would adversely affect the SpinCo Group or the
SpinCo Business without the prior written consent of Clover (SpinCo Group),
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or without making adequate
provision for such rights of SpinCo Group or SpinCo businesses. For the
avoidance of doubt, SpinCo shall be responsible for securing all Insurance
Policies that it considers appropriate for the SpinCo Business and the
operation thereof by the SpinCo Group and for promptly providing evidence
thereof, as may be required, to third parties under any Contract. SpinCo
agrees to arrange for its own Insurance Policies with respect to the SpinCo
Business and the SpinCo Group covering all periods. SpinCo agrees, on behalf
of itself and each member of the SpinCo Group, from and after the Distribution
Time, not to seek through any means to benefit from and not to assert any
right, claim or interest in, to or under, any Insurance Policies of any member
of the Moon Group, except as permitted under _Section 7.3(b)_ or the Tender
Agreement.

  

(b) For any claim asserted against SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo
Group after the Effective Time arising out of any occurrence, claim, loss,
injury or damage taking place prior to the Effective Time ("Post-Closing
Claims"), SpinCo and each other member of the SpinCo Group may access coverage
under the Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policies for such claims (it being
understood that any retrospective premiums, deductibles or similar obligations
arising from such any corresponding insurance claims by or on behalf of any
member of the SpinCo Group under the Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policies
shall be borne by the SpinCo Group). From and after the Effective Time, if
SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group determines to submit a Post-Closing
Claim for coverage under the Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policies, SpinCo
shall provide a written request to Moon and shall promptly thereafter provide
Moon with all information to be included with such Post-Closing Claim. Moon
shall promptly, following receipt of such information, submit the applicable
Post-Closing Claim under the applicable Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policies.
Moon thereafter shall use its best efforts to secure insurance coverage for
SpinCo/Clover for the Post-Closing Claim under the Pre-Closing Occurrence-
Based Policies. In doing so, Moon will undertake reasonable best efforts to
get its insurers to accept and pay defense and indemnity costs for the Post-
Closing Claim, but in no event will Moon guarantee results and in no event
will Moon be liable for Post-Closing Claim costs that are not covered by
insurance. In no event will Moon be obligated to initiate at its own costs or
bear the costs of coverage litigation. Nor shall Moon be obligated to initiate
any coverage litigation that would adversely affect Moon's rights. No SpinCo
Group Member shall be entitled to make claims directly to any Pre-Closing
Occurrence-Based Policies and in connection with any Post-Closing Claim.
SpinCo or the other member(s) of the SpinCo Group shall be responsible for the
satisfaction or payment of any applicable retention, deductible or
retrospective premium with respect to any Post-Closing Claim. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, any Insurance Proceeds received by a member of
the Moon Group in respect of a Post-Closing Claim shall be promptly
transmitted to SpinCo or another member of the SpinCo Group designated by
SpinCo. In the event that a Post-Closing Claim is a Mixed Action

  

 

63  

  

or a Mixed Asbestos Claim (as defined in the Tender Agreement) for which Moon
or its Subsidiaries and SpinCo or other member of the SpinCo Group are seeking
coverage under Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policies, and the limits under an
applicable Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policy are not sufficient to fund all
covered claims of SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group (as
applicable) and Moon or its Subsidiaries (as applicable), amounts due under
such a Pre-Closing Occurrence-Based Policy shall be paid to the respective
Persons in proportion to the amounts that otherwise would be due were the
limits of liability infinite.

  

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ will be construed to alter or limit in any
way the indemnity obligations of the Parties, including those in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.3_
to the contrary, insurance coverage rights and obligations with respect to
Excluded Asbestos Liabilities and Specified Asbestos Liabilities are governed
by the Tender Agreement.

  

Section 7.4 _Separation Expenses_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, the out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses of Moon, SpinCo and the members of their respective Groups (i)
incurred in connection with the Reorganization, the Distribution and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the transactions
contemplated by _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.5_ ) and the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) incurred as Set-Up Costs (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement), (iii) incurred for the provision of post-termination
assistance pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Transition Services Agreement or
(iv) incurred in connection with the actions or activities set forth in
_Schedule 2.13_ (except as otherwise expressly provided therein), shall in
each case be borne as provided in _Schedule 7.4_. In the event of any conflict
between a Transaction Document and an allocation of expenses expressly
provided in _Schedule 7.4_ , _Schedule 7.4_ shall control.

  

Section 7.5 _Transaction Documents_.

  

(a) Effective on or prior to the Distribution Time, each of Moon and SpinCo
will, or will cause the applicable members of its Group to, execute and
deliver the Transition Services Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the
Employee Matters Agreement, the Real Estate Matters Agreement, the
Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement, the
Supply Agreements, the Headquarters Lease and the Tender Agreement. In the
event that the provisions of any of the other Transaction Documents conflict
with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of such other agreement
or agreements shall govern with respect to the subject matter addressed
thereby to the extent of such conflict. Specifically, the Parties intend that,
to the extent set forth in such other Transaction Document and unless
otherwise provided therein, (i) the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements between the Parties with respect to Taxes or other Tax matters
(including indemnification for Taxes and control of any Tax Contest (as
defined in the Tax Matters Agreement)) shall be governed exclusively by the
Tax Matters Agreement ( _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent expressly
addressing Taxes or other Tax matters, including _Section 2.4(e)_ , _Section
2.5(e)_ , _Section 2.7(d)_ , _Section 2.8(f)_ ,

  

 

64  

  

 _Section 3.3(e)_ and _Section 6.6(c),_ shall apply in accordance with their
terms and nothing in this _clause (i)_ shall be interpreted as affecting the
applicability of, or the rights and obligations set forth in, such
provisions), (ii) the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
(including agreements as to the allocation of Assets and Liabilities, to the
extent addressed therein) between the Parties with respect to employment
matters or matters relating to compensation and benefits shall be governed
exclusively by the Employee Matters Agreement, (iii) the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements between the Parties with respect to real
property matters (including agreements as to the allocation of Assets and
Liabilities, to the extent addressed therein) shall be governed exclusively by
the Real Estate Matters Agreement, (iv) the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject
matters contemplated by the Trademark License Agreement shall be governed
exclusively by the Trademark License Agreement, (v) the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements between the Parties with respect to the
subject matters contemplated by the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement
shall be governed exclusively by the Intellectual Property Matters Agreement
and (vi) the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements between the
Parties with respect to the subject matters contemplated by the Tender
Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the Tender Agreement; _provided_
that, in each case, the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
referred to in this sentence shall refer to the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in the applicable Transaction Document.

  

(b) Prior to the Distribution Time, with respect to any Transaction Document
that has not yet been executed, but for which the form of such Transaction
Document attached hereto expressly contemplates covenants or other agreements
that on their face would be operative prior to the Distribution Time if such
Transaction Document had been executed by the parties thereto as of the date
hereof, then notwithstanding the fact that such Transaction Document has not
yet been executed by the parties thereto, the Parties agree on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates that all such provisions are
incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis, and shall be operative
prior to the Distribution Time as if such Transaction Document had been
executed with respect to such provisions prior to the relevant time.

  

Section 7.6 _Permits_. The Moon Group shall cooperate with the SpinCo Group
and take all actions that are reasonably necessary or advisable to finalize or
effectuate the transfer of a Permit to the SpinCo Group that is designated as
a SpinCo Asset and that is not already transferred to a member of the SpinCo
Group as of the Distribution Time. The SpinCo Group shall cooperate with the
Moon Group and take actions that are reasonably necessary or advisable to
finalize or effectuate the transfer of a Permit to the Moon Group that is
designated as an Excluded Asset and that is not already transferred to a
member of the Moon Group as of the Distribution Time. The Moon Group and the
SpinCo Group agree to cooperate with each other regarding the allocation of
responsibilities for Permits at shared real properties shared between members
of the Moon Group and the SpinCo Group. If any Permit cannot be transferred
then during the pendency of transferring such Permit, the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to develop and implement arrangements to pass
along to the SpinCo Group the ability to continue to operate the SpinCo
Business as presently conducted under the terms of any such permit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to the extent expressly provided in this
Agreement (including _Section 7.4_ ) or in any of the other Transaction
Documents, neither Party shall be

  

 

65  

  

obligated to contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form
(including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or
commercial accommodation) to any Person in order to effect the transfer of any
permit.

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

Section 8.1 _Dispute Resolution Procedures_. (a) Each Party shall appoint a
representative who shall be responsible for administering this dispute
resolution provision (the " _Appointed Representative_ ").

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in any other Transaction
Document, and without limiting the rights of any Party under _Section 9.10_ ,
in the event of a controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, in connection
with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance, nonperformance,
validity, termination or breach of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or otherwise arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (collectively, the " _Separation Agreement Disputes_ "), the Appointed
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith for a reasonable period of time
to settle such Separation Agreement Dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that:
(i) such reasonable period shall not, unless otherwise agreed to by the
relevant Parties in writing, exceed twenty (20) days from the time of receipt
by a Party of written notice of such Separation Agreement Dispute; and (ii)
the relevant employees from both Parties with knowledge and interest in the
dispute shall first have tried to resolve the differences between the Parties;
_provided_ , _further_ , that prior to the Effective Time, no Separation
Agreement Dispute may be settled without the prior written consent of Clover.
Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course of any
negotiations, conferences and discussions in connection with efforts to settle
an Separation Agreement Dispute that is not otherwise independently
discoverable shall be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment
or for any other purpose, but shall be considered as to have been disclosed
for settlement purposes.

  

ARTICLE IX

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

Section 9.1 _Corporate Power; Facsimile Signatures_.

  

(a) Moon represents on behalf of itself and on behalf of other members of the
Moon Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and on behalf of other
members of the SpinCo Group, as follows:

  

(i) each such Person has the requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a Party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and

  

(ii) this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which it is a Party has
been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.

  

 

66  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, neither Moon nor SpinCo shall be required to take or omit to take
any act that would violate its fiduciary duties to any minority stockholders
of any non-wholly owned Subsidiary of Moon or SpinCo, as the case may be (
_it_ _being_ _understood_ that directors' qualifying shares or similar
interests will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a Subsidiary
is wholly owned).

  

Section 9.2 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial_.

  

(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law
principles thereof. The Parties expressly waive any right they may have, now
or in the future, to demand or seek the application of a governing Law other
than the Law of the State of Delaware.

  

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, of if jurisdiction is not then available in such federal court, then
in any Delaware state court siting in New Castle County) and any appellate
court from any appeal thereof (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") in any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Action except in such
courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Action may be heard
and determined in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the Chosen Courts and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action in the Chosen Courts. Each of the
Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in _Section 9.5_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY

67  

  

REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.2(c).

  

Section 9.3 _Survival of Covenants_. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the Merger Agreement, the
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document, a liability for the breach of any obligations contained
herein or therein, shall survive each of the Reorganization, the Distribution
and the Merger, and shall remain in full force and effect.

  

Section 9.4 _Waivers of Default_. Any Party may, at any time prior to the
Closing, by action taken by its board of directors, a committee thereof or
officers thereunto duly authorized, waive any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement or (without limiting _Section 9.11_ ) agree to an amendment or
modification to this Agreement by an agreement in writing executed in the same
manner (but not necessarily by the same Persons) as this Agreement; _provided_
, that, unless the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with its terms, any such waiver, amendment or modification by SpinCo shall be
subject to the prior written consent of Clover (except as otherwise provided
in _Section 2.1(d)_ and subject to the consent standards therein). No waiver
by any of the Parties of any breach hereunder, whether intentional or not,
shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the
Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

  

Section 9.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the Parties
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when
delivered in person, (b) when delivered after posting in the United States
mail having been sent registered or certified mail return receipt requested,

Section 9.6 _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate simultaneously with
the valid termination of the Merger Agreement prior to the Distribution.
Except for a termination described in the immediately preceding sentence,
prior to the Effective Time, SpinCo shall not agree to terminate this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Clover. After the Effective
Time, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing
signed by each of the Parties. In the event of such termination, this
Agreement shall become void and no

  

 

69  

  

Party, or any of its officers and directors, shall have any liability to any
Person by reason of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, or the application of any provision to any Person or
circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect. The Parties further agree that if any provision contained
herein is, to any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under
the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to
render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that
is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving
effect to the intent of the Parties.

  

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Merger Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) including any related annexes, Exhibits and Schedules,
as well as any other agreements and documents referred to herein and therein,
shall together constitute the entire agreement between the Parties relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements,
whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among
any of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 9.9 _Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No Party may assign
its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the written
consent of the other Parties ( _provided_ that prior to the Effective Time,
SpinCo shall not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Clover). Any attempted assignment or delegation in breach of this _Section
9.9_ shall be null and void, except that (without limiting any other provision
of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement) a
Party may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
in connection with a sale or disposition of any assets or entities or lines of
business of such Party or in connection with a merger transaction in which
such Party is not the surviving entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case, no such assignment shall release such Party from any liability or
obligation under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other than the Parties,
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except as
provided in _Article VI_ with respect to Indemnified Parties (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that Clover shall be a
third-party beneficiary of the rights of Clover as provided in this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents.

  

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened
default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document (except as otherwise provided therein),
the Party who is, or is to be, thereby aggrieved shall have the right to
specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief (on an interim
or permanent basis) in respect of its rights under this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document. The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any
breach or threatened breach,

  

 

70  

  

including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that
any defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any
bond with such remedy are waived by each of the Parties to this Agreement.

  

Section 9.11 _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document (except as otherwise provided herein or therein,
including as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_ ) may be amended or modified except
by a written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto or thereto, as
applicable. In addition, unless the Merger Agreement shall have been

_Corporation_ ") is Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc.

  

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is
located at The Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801, and the name of the
registered agent of the Corporation whose office address will be the same as
the registered office is The Corporation Trust Company.

  

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), as from time to time amended.

  

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which shares shall be Common
Stock having a par value per share of $0.01.

  

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law,
subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted,
amended or repealed by a majority of the board of directors of the
Corporation. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  

SIXTH: To the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, a director of the
Corporation shall not he personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.
If the DGCL is amended after the filing of the Certificate of Incorporation of
which this article is a part to authorize corporate action further eliminating
or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of
this Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation in respect of any act or omission occurring prior
to the time of such amendment or repeal.

  

SEVENTH: The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_ ") who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for
whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another entity or enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in the
third paragraph of this Article SEVENTH, the Corporation shall be required to
indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof)
commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding
(or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized by the Board.

  

    

  

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Corporation shall pay the
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in
defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of
expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made
only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts
advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article SEVENTH or otherwise.

  

If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article
SEVENTH is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor by
the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such
claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving
that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or
advancement of expenses under applicable law.

Incorporation, the Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  

The Corporation\'s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to
any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another entity or enterprise shall be reduced by
any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement
of expenses from such other entity or enterprise.

  

Any repeat or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article SEVENTH
shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered
Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such
amendment or repeal.

  

This Article SEVENTH shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized
by appropriate corporate action.

 _VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT_

  

THIS VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT, dated as of April 30, 2019 (the "
_Agreement_ "), between Ingersoll-Rand plc, a Republic of Ireland public
limited company (" _Moon_ "), and the undersigned, a stockholder (the "
_Shareholder_ ") of Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Clover_ ").

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  

WHEREAS, Moon, Clover, Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, and Charm Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation, are parties to
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be
amended, supplemented, restated or modified from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ ");

  

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, Shareholder is the beneficial owner
of 70,671,135 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Clover
(the " _Clover Common Stock_ ") (such shares of Clover Common Stock, the
Shareholder's " _Existing Shares_ " and such Existing Shares, together with
any additional capital stock of the Company beneficially owned or acquired by
Shareholder on or after the date hereof, the " _Shareholder Shares_ ");

  

WHEREAS, as an inducement and a condition to Moon entering into the Merger
Agreement, Shareholder is entering into this Agreement with Moon;

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Clover has adopted the Merger Agreement and
approved the transactions contemplated thereby, and has consented to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement in connection therewith,
understanding that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder
is a material inducement and condition to Moon's willingness to enter into the
Merger Agreement; and

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  

1. _Agreements of Shareholder._

  

(a) _Voting_. From the date hereof until any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, and without in any way limiting Shareholder's right
to vote the Shares in its sole discretion on any other matters that may be
submitted to a shareholder vote or other approval, at any meeting of the
shareholders of Clover however called or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, Shareholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) all outstanding
Shareholder Shares, (i) in favor of the Clover Share Issuance and any other
matters necessary for consummation of the Clover Share Issuance, and (ii)
against any Competing Proposal and any agreement (including, without
limitation, any amendment of any agreement), amendment of Clover's
organizational documents or other action that is intended or would reasonably
be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Clover Share Issuance
or the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Shareholder to vote in favor of or otherwise take any action that
would result in, any Material Amendment to the Merger Agreement.

  

    

   

(b) _Restriction on Transfer; Proxies; Non-Interference; etc_. From the date
hereof until any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Shareholder shall not directly or indirectly (i) sell, transfer, give, pledge,
encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), or
enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with
respect to the Transfer of, any Shareholder Shares (or any right, title or
interest thereto or therein), (ii) deposit any Shareholder Shares into a
voting trust or grant any proxies or enter into a voting agreement, power of
attorney or voting trust with respect to any Shareholder Shares (except to the
extent otherwise permitted by this Agreement) or (iii) agree (whether or not
in writing) to take any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses
(i) or (ii) of this _Section 1(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing restrictions on Transfer will not be applicable to, and Shareholder
will not be restricted or prohibited from taking, any of the following actions
with respect to the Shareholder Shares (and the taking of such actions will
not constitute a breach of this Agreement): (A) a bona fide pledge of, or
grant of a security interest in, Shareholder Shares in connection with any
financing arrangements with a financial institution that is in the business of
engaging in such transactions (provided that Shareholder does not know or have
reason to know that such financial institution is engaging in such
transactions for the purpose of acquiring Clover Common Stock or voting rights
with respect thereto for its own account or with an intent to transfer such
Clover Common Stock or such rights to a particular person or group), including
any resulting Transfer of such pledged shares (or shares in which a security
interest has been granted) upon any foreclosure under the indebtedness
underlying such pledge or security interest; (B) any Transfer of Shareholder
Shares to an Affiliate of Shareholder so long as such Affiliate executes an
instrument assuming all the rights, benefits and obligations of Shareholder
hereunder and (C) any Transfer of up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding
Clover Common Stock following the Clover Stockholders Meeting.

  

(c) _Information for Registration Statement_. Shareholder consents to Moon
publishing and disclosing in any filing required under applicable Law,
including the filings contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Shareholder's
identity and ownership of Clover Common Stock and the nature of Shareholder's
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement; _provided_
that Moon shall have consulted with Shareholder with respect to such
disclosure prior to making such disclosure.

  

2. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Moon as follows:

  

(a) _Authority_. Shareholder has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder
and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
Moon, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable
against Shareholder in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of
equity).

  

(b) _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Other than filings under the
Exchange Act, and other than such as, if not made, obtained or given, would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the performance by Shareholder
of any of its obligations under this Agreement, no notices, reports or other
filings are required to be made by Shareholder with, nor

  

  

 

2  

  

are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required
to be obtained by Shareholder from, any Governmental Entity or any other
Person or entity, in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Shareholder. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, result in a violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification or
acceleration) (whether after the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both) under any contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment to which
Shareholder is a party or which is binding on it or its assets and will not
result in the creation of any Lien on any of the assets or properties of
Shareholder (other than the Shareholder Shares), except for such violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, modifications, accelerations
or Liens as would not reasonably be expected to prevent the performance by
Shareholder of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

(c) _Ownership of Shareholder Shares_. As of the date of this Agreement,
Shareholder beneficially owns all of the Existing Shares, free and clear of
any proxy or voting restriction (other than restrictions under this
Agreement). Without limiting the foregoing, as of the date hereof, except for
restrictions in favor of Moon pursuant to this Agreement, a (i) Shareholder
has sole voting power and sole power of disposition with respect to all
Existing Shares, with no restrictions on Shareholder's rights of voting or
disposition pertaining thereto (except as provided in this _Section 2(c)_ )
and (ii) no person other than Shareholder has any right to direct or approve
the voting or disposition of any Existing Shares. The Existing Shares
constitute all of the shares of Clover Common Stock owned of record or
beneficially by Shareholder as of the date hereof.

  

(d) _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person
is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar
fee or commission that is payable by Moon or Clover or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Shareholder.

  

3. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate, and no party hereunder will have any further obligation to the other parties hereto upon and following such termination, on the first to occur of (a) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the Effective Time, and (c) the execution of any written instrument applicable to the Merger Agreement which amends, modifies or changes (i) the definition of "Exchange Ratio" or (ii) _Article II_ (The Merger), _Article III_ (Conversion of Shares), _Article VIII_ (Conditions to the Merger), or _Article IX_ (Termination) thereof, or any defined term used in such Sections or Articles, in each case, for purposes of this clause (c), solely if any such written instrument would reasonably be expected to be adverse to Shareholder (any of the foregoing, a " _Material Amendment_ ") and has been executed without the prior written consent of Shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination and (ii) the provisions of this _Section 4_ and _Section 5_ of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

4. _Miscellaneous_.

  

  

 

3  

  

(a) _Fiduciary Duties_. The Shareholder is entering into this Agreement solely
in its capacity as the record or beneficial owner of the Shareholder Shares
and nothing herein is intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken
by any of the Shareholder's designees serving in his or her capacity as a
director of Clover (or a Subsidiary of Clover). The taking of any actions (or
failures to act) by the Shareholder's designees serving as a director of
Clover (or a Subsidiary of Clover) shall not be deemed to constitute a breach
of this Agreement.

  

(b) _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

(c) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at the request of Moon, and
without further consideration, Shareholder shall execute and deliver such
additional documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably
required to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(d) _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is not intended to and
shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
hereunder.

  

(e) _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section 5(g)_ shall be null and void.

  

(f) _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented,
except by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto. No failure or
delay by a party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

  

(g) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law or public policy,
all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  

  

 

4  

  

(h) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more separate
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
hereof signed by the other parties hereto.

  

(i) _Descriptive Headings_. Headings of sections and subsections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

  

(j) _Notices_. All notices and other communications among the Parties shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered in
person, (b) when delivered after posting in the United States mail having been
sent registered or certified mail return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
(c) when delivered by FedEx or other nationally recognized overnight delivery
service or (d) when delivered by facsimile (solely if receipt is confirmed) or

Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided

of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted

(iii) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
