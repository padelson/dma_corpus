Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the
North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ "), at the Effective
Time the Company shall merge with and into Buyer. Buyer shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of North Carolina. As of the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease. 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and articles of
merger (the " _North Carolina Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina on the Closing Date.
The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger
becomes effective as set forth in the Delaware Certificate of Merger and the
North Carolina Articles of Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and Section 55-11-06 of
the NCBCA.

1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company or
the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ "), and each share of common stock, no par value per
share, of Buyer (the " _Buyer Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and
shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) All shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company,
Parent or Buyer (other than shares of Company Common Stock held in trust
accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts), managed accounts and the
like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that
are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account
Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly
or indirectly, by the Company, Parent or Buyer in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or Buyer and no
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to _Sections 1.4(e)_, _1.4(g)_ and _1.5_ , each share of Company
Common Stock, except for shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to
_Section 1.4(b)_ above and except for Dissenting Shares, shall be converted,
at the election of the holder thereof, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section 2.1_, into the right to receive the following, without
interest:

(i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive Parent Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to _Article II_ (a " _Stock Election_ "), that
fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock equal
to the amount, rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth (the " _Conversion
Number_ "), derived by dividing the Per Share Amount by the Market Price (such
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to be paid per share of Company
Common Stock is referred to as the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ")
(collectively, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that elect
to be converted into the right to receive Per Share Stock Consideration are
referred to as the " _Stock Election Shares_ ");



 

2 (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked
pursuant to _Article II_ (a " _Cash Election_ "), an amount in cash equal to
the Per Share Amount (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together
with the Per Share Stock Consideration, the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ") (collectively, the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock that elect to be converted into the right to receive Per Share Cash
Consideration are referred to as the " _Cash Election Shares_ "); and any
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares; or

(iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked or
deemed revoked pursuant to _Article II_ (collectively, the " _Non-
Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from Parent such Per Share Stock
Consideration or from Buyer such Per Share Cash Consideration, each as is
determined in accordance with _Section 1.5_, _provided_ that the total amount
of cash (the " _Total Cash Amount_ ") payable under this _Section 1.4(c)_,
shall be equal to, as nearly as practicable, but in no event shall exceed the
product of (x) the Per Share Amount, (y) 50% and (z) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Dissenting Shares shall be treated as having
elected to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration for purposes of
calculating the Total Cash Amount. The calculations required by this _Section
1.4(c)_ shall be prepared jointly by Parent and the Company prior to the
Closing Date.

(iv) " _Market Price_ " means the volume-weighted average trading price of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as
reported by the NYSE Composite Transaction Reporting System for each of the
five full consecutive NYSE trading days ending on the trading day immediately
before the Closing Date (the " _Pricing Period_ "). The volume-weighted
average trading price shall be calculated by dividing the total value of
Parent Common Stock traded during the five-day period by the total volume of
Parent Common Stock traded during the same period.

(v) " _Per Share Amount_ " means USD $80.00.

(d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article I_ shall
no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration (and, in the case of any fractional shares, cash in lieu
thereof), into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ and _Section
2.3(f)_, as well as any dividends to which holders of Company Common Stock
become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_.

(e) If, during the Pricing Period, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Conversion
Number to ensure that such change or event in no way results in a detriment to
the Companys stockholders.



 

3 (f) At the Effective Time, Buyer shall issue to Parent the Buyer Shares in
consideration for the issuance by Parent of the Parent Common Stock to the
Holders of Company Common Stock.

For the purposes of this _Section 1.4(f)_, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:

" _Buyer Shares_ " shall mean fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Buyer Common Stock with an aggregate FMV at the Effective Time equal to the
aggregate Market Price of the Parent Common Stock issued by Parent to the
Companys Stockholders.

" _FMV_ " shall mean the fair market value of the shares of Buyer Common Stock
issued to Parent as determined by a method to be agreed upon between Parent
and Buyer, _provided_ that in the event that Buyer and Parent cannot agree on
the FMV, such determination shall be made by an investment banking firm to be
selected by Buyer and Parent and _provided_ _further_ that in the event Buyer
and Parent cannot agree on the selection of an investment banking firm, Buyer
and Parent agree that RBC Capital Markets Corporation shall serve in such
capacity. Buyer shall pay all expenses related to the investment banking
firm. The decision of the investment banking firm shall be final and binding
on both Buyer and Parent.

(g) Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
to which a Holder has perfected his or rights granted pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration hereunder, and the
Holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice upon receipt by the
Company of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of
Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other
instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder making such
demand being hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure
to timely deliver a written demand for Appraisal Rights or the taking of any
other action by such Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary to
perfect Appraisal Rights. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
his, her or its right to such payment at or prior to the Election Deadline,
such Holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into a right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such Holder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its
Appraisal Rights after the Election Deadline, each share of Company Common
Stock of such Holder shall be treated as a Non-Election Share.

 



 

4 1.5 _Proration_.

(a) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company
Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger
in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

(i) __Cash Oversubscribed__. If the aggregate cash amount that would
otherwise be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election
Shares is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) each Stock Election Share and Non-Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, 

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares
(other than Dissenting Shares that have not withdrawn or lost their Appraisal
Rights prior to the Election Deadline), by a pro rata selection process, a
sufficient number of shares to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("
_Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be
paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable but does not exceed the
Total Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and 

(C) the Cash Election Shares (other than Dissenting Shares that have not
withdrawn or lost their Appraisal Rights prior to the Election Deadline) that
are not Stock Designated Shares will be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(ii) __Cash Undersubscribed__. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares is less than the
Total Cash Amount, then:

(A) each Cash Election Share (other than Dissenting Shares that have not
withdrawn or lost their Appraisal Rights prior to the Election Deadline)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Non-Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection process, and then (if necessary) from among
the Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient
number of shares to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Cash
Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger equals as closely as practicable but does not exceed the Total Cash
Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

(C) the Stock Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



 

5 (iii) __Cash Subscriptions Sufficient__. If the aggregate cash amount that
would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares is
equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to (but in no
event in excess of) the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares that have not withdrawn or lost their Appraisal Rights prior to the
Election Deadline) shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

(b) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined
by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time.

1.6 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this _Section 1.6_ pertain to
all plans sponsored by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company under which
options and other stock-based amounts are awarded, including the plans set
forth on _Section 1.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as defined in
Article III), all as amended, and the award agreements thereunder
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ").

(b) As of the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plans, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any options or other stock-based awards, each
participant in any of the Company Stock Plans shall fully and immediately vest
in any options or other stock-based awards awarded under such Company Stock
Plans.

(c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted to employees or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any of the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Options_
") shall be converted into an amount in cash equal to the Per Share
Amount less the exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time. To the
extent necessary, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents of the participants in the Company Stock Plans to such
treatment.

(d) With respect to awards of Performance Shares (as defined therein) under
the Alabama National BanCorporation Performance Share Plan, as amended and
restated, and the Alabama National BanCorporation Performance Share and
Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Affiliate Banks (collectively, the
" _Performance Share Plans_ "), as of the Effective Time such Performance
Shares shall be converted to cash, and such cash shall be paid out as soon as
practicable in accordance with the respective terms of the Performance Share
Plans (but in no event later than 10 days after the Effective Time).

(e) At the Effective Time, all deferred amounts held in unit accounts or
otherwise pursuant to the Alabama National BanCorporation Deferral of
Compensation Plan for Key Employees, the Alabama National BanCorporation Plan
for the Deferral  



 

6  of Compensation for Directors who are not Employees of the Company, the
Alabama National BanCorporation Plan for the Deferral of Compensation by Non-
Employee Directors of Subsidiary Banks, and the Amended and Restated
Performance Share Plan For Certain Directors of Citizens and Peoples Bank,
N.A. (collectively, the " _Deferral Plans_ "), except for deferred amounts as
to which the treatment in the Merger is separately agreed to in writing by
Buyer and the holder thereof, which amount shall be treated as so agreed,
shall be converted into an obligation to pay cash in accordance with the terms
of the Deferral Plans. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents of the participants in the Deferral Plans to such
treatment.

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation of Buyer_. At the Effective Time, the Buyer
Articles shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.8 _Bylaws of Buyer_. At the Effective Time, the Buyer Bylaws shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law.

1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

1.10 _Board of Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be comprised of the directors of Buyer. 

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock (" _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the
following procedures:

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.1_ (each, an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election.

(b) Before the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
mutually agreeable to the Company pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange
Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
hereunder. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as the Company, Parent
and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed no
more than 40 business days and no fewer than 26 business days before the
anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier date as the Company, Parent and
Buyer shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each Holder as of five
business days before the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").
Each Election Form shall permit such Holder, subject to the allocation and
election procedures set forth in this _Section 2.1_, to (i) elect to  



 

7  receive the Per Share Cash Consideration for all of the shares of Company
Common Stock held by such Holder in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_, (ii)
elect to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration for all of such shares in
accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_, (iii) elect to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration for a part of such Holders Company Common Stock and the Per
Share Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such Holders Company
Common Stock or (iv) indicate that such Holder has no preference as to the
receipt of cash or Parent Common Stock for such shares (a " _Non-Election_
"). A Holder who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another
representative capacity (a " _Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election
Forms, _provided_ that each such Election Form covers all the shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial
owner. Any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which the Holder
thereof has not, as of the Election Deadline, made an election by submission
to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall
be deemed Non-Election Shares.

(c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted to
the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Birmingham, Alabama time, on the
day indicated on the Election Form (or such other time and date as Buyer and
the Company may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Election Deadline may not occur before the 25th day
following the Mailing Date or after the NYSE trading day before the Closing
Date. Buyer shall make available as promptly as possible an Election Form to
any Holder who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of
the Election Forms and before the Election Deadline. The Company shall provide
to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform
as specified herein. An Election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form
by the Election Deadline. If a Holder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form in a timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form
before the Election Deadline (without later submitting a properly completed
Election Form before the Election Deadline), the shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Holder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any
Holder may revoke or change his or her Election by written notice to the
Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or change is actually
received by the Exchange Agent at or before the Election Deadline. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine when any Election, modification or
revocation is received and whether any such Election, modification or
revocation has been properly made.



 

8 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or before the Effective Time, (a)
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to deliver, and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely
deliver, the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration, and (b) Buyer shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent immediately
available funds equal to the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration (together
with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_) (together with the Parent Common Stock
deposited pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_
"), and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration and such cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with this Agreement.

2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Certificate(s) that immediately before the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s)
shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in
such form and have such other provisions as shall be approved by the Company
and prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange
for the Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_ upon surrender of such Certificate(s) and
any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
_Section 2.3(c)_.

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates,
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder will be
entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Per Share Merger
Consideration (with the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration paid to each
such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its
Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or
distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article
II_.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect
of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate in accordance with this  _Article II_, the Holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, in addition to the Per
Share Merger Consideration, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date on or after the Effective  



 

9  Time theretofore payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate with a record date on or after the Effective Time (but before such
surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of
the Company, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the
Holder of the Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of Buyer that
the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or,
subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Buyer) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Buyer, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Buyer, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent or Buyer, as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred before the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Buyer shall pay to each
former Holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share
an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i)
the Per Share Amount by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest ten thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock that such Holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_.



 

10 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Holders of
Company Common Stock as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be
paid to Buyer. In such event, any former Holders who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Buyer with
respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
Holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Buyer, the
Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
Holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Buyer, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Buyer,
Parent or Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration and dividends
payable and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the " _Company Disclosure

either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this _Article III_ , or to one or more of the
Companys covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item
is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under
the standard established by _Section 9.2_, (ii) the mere inclusion of an
item in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in _Section
3.8(a)_) on the Company, and (iii) materiality shall be measured by taking the

represents and warrants to Buyer as set forth on the Company Disclosure

and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly

and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary.



 

11 (b) The Company is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). True, complete
and correct copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of Alabama National

Voting Debt or any other equity securities of the Company or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of the
Companys capital stock, Voting Debt or other equity securities of the
Company. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as set forth in
_Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
equity security of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or could be

Other than as set forth in the Company Stock Plans or as set forth on _Section
3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no equity-based awards are

consolidated basis; to the Companys knowledge and in light of their
historical loan loss experiences and their managements analyses of the
quality and performance of their loan portfolios, as of June 30, 2007, their
reserves for loan losses are adequate to absorb potential loan losses

Subsidiaries leasehold estate, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and except

possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such

Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, the lessor. The

person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by and/or licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Since December
31, 2005, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of any claim that is currently pending with respect to any
Intellectual Property used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to
the Companys knowledge, no Intellectual Property owned and/or licensed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries is being used or enforced in a manner that would
result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such
Intellectual Property. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intellectual
Property_ " means trademarks, service marks, brand names, certification

or ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis

Company (a) is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) knows of no reason why all
regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis without imposing a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition on any of the Company, Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation.

 

3.23 _Opinion_. Before the execution of this Agreement, the Company Board has

proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(b) There is no material injunction, judgment or, to Parents knowledge, any

assessments upon Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries for
which Parent or Buyer does not have reserves that are adequate under Canadian
GAAP or U.S. GAAP, respectively. Parent satisfies and has satisfied all the
requirements of the "active trade or business test" under Treasury Regulation
§1.367(a)-3(c)(3) up to and through the Effective Time. There are no facts
known to Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries which,

filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties or Governmental Entities. The Company, Parent and Buyer shall have the
right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult
the others on, in each case subject to this Agreement and to applicable laws
relating to the confidentiality of information, all the information relating
to the Company, Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other  



 

41  apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions

restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities, that would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to

Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(c) Each of Buyer, Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the
other parties all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,

contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Buyer, Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other
parties upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the
consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions

Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each of the Company and Buyer shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,

properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request (in the
case of a request by the Company, including without limitation information

contemplated hereby). Neither the Company nor Buyer, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into before the date of this Agreement. The parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



 

42 (b) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and
representatives to, maintain in confidence all information received from
another party (other than disclosure to that partys agents and
representatives in connection with the evaluation and consummation of the
Merger) in connection with this Agreement or the Merger (including the
existence and terms of this Agreement) and use such information solely to
evaluate the Merger, unless (i) such information is already known to the
receiving party or its agents and representatives, (ii) such information

representatives by a third party that, to the knowledge of the receiving
party, is not bound by a duty of confidentiality, (iii) such information
becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (iv) the
receiving party in good faith believes that the use of such information is
necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent
required for the Merger (in which case the receiving party shall advise the
other party before making the disclosure) or (v) the receiving party in good
faith believes that the furnishing or use of such information is required by
or necessary or appropriate in connection with any applicable laws or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the receiving party shall advise the other party before making the

the obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein shall not
apply to the tax structure or the tax treatment of the Merger, and each party
(and their respective Representatives) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax structure and tax treatment of the
Merger and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analysis) that are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment and
tax structure;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such disclosure shall not
include the name (or other identifying information not relevant to the tax
structure or tax treatment) of any person and shall not include information

its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its stockholders the
stockholder vote approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with its terms pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the
Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company

Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and directing that the Merger, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to

43 (b) Each of Parent, Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts (i) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its

respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, a written agreement in the form
of Exhibit A.

6.5 _Market Listing_. Buyer and Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
Parent Stock Exchanges, subject to official notice of issuance, before the

(a) For at least the twelve-month period following the Effective Time, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide those
individuals actively employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from,
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of
base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base
salary or hourly wage and employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities
provided to such Covered Employees under the Company Benefit Plans as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time; notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of
any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.6_, (iii) limit the right of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered
Employee at any time or require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to provide
any such Covered Employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or
annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination,
other than as required by applicable law or pro-rata incentive plan payouts,
(iv) obligate the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
(A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment
of any particular employee; or (v) limit or impair the rights of any Covered
Employee under any employment, severance or change-in-control agreement. Buyer
will offer or provide to any Covered Employee retained by Buyer or any
affiliate of Buyer participation in employee benefit plans and arrangements
available for similarly situated employees of Buyer or its affiliates.



 

44 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in
an employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries,
Buyer shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of
such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual (except for benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans) under such employee benefit plan of Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee; and
(ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the
plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such
Buyer or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee
and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred by
such Covered Employee in the plan year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(c) If a Covered Employee who does not have an employment, change-in-control
or severance agreement with the Company (i) is terminated by Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries due to a permanent or indefinite reduction in staff resulting
in job elimination, reduction of a position as the result of an organizational
or business restructuring, discontinuance of an operation, relocation of all
or a part of Buyers or its Subsidiaries business, sale of an operation to
another company, or sale or other change in ownership of all or a part of
Buyers or its Subsidiaries business, or (ii) voluntarily resigns after
being notified that, as a condition of employment, such Covered Employee must
work at a location more than thirty (30) miles from his or her former location
of employment or that such Covered Employees base salary will be materially
decreased, in any case and in both cases, during the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending six months following the Effective Time, such
Covered Employee shall be entitled to receive severance payments and benefits
in an amount and form as generally described in Section 6.6(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ _further_ , that such Covered Employee
whose employment terminates in accordance with (i) or (ii) above shall also be
entitled to receive payment of COBRA premium costs for the continuation of
group medical insurance benefit coverage for the Covered Employee and his or
her eligible dependents for a period equal to the total number of weeks of
base salary/wages available to such Covered Employee as severance pay. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Buyer to effectuate the
foregoing, including Buyers compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining
and Notification Act or any similar state or local law.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as
of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof with the prior
written consent of Buyer, each employment agreement, severance agreement,
retention agreement and change-in-control agreement listed on Section 3.11(i)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the
applicable counterparty to such agreement) and the obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each
deferred compensation plan or agreement to which the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries is a party or sponsor.

(e) One business day before the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and the terms of the applicable plan, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan and any other 401(k) plans
maintained by a Company Subsidiary to be terminated. 



 

45 (f) With respect to those employee benefit plans and agreements covering
Covered Employees that may be or become subject to Section 409A of the Code
from and after the Effective Time, the Company shall make reasonable efforts
to take, or to cause there to be taken, such timely actions as may be
necessary or appropriate (including communication of such actions with Buyer,
upon the written request of Buyer) to prevent excise Tax and other Tax
penalties under Section 409A of the Code from applying to payments or benefits
under such plans or agreements, _provided_ that such efforts shall not result
in any additional cost to Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries. This Section 6.6(f) shall be deemed satisfied to the
extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries provide a timely, written
notice to Covered Employees of such employees need to consult with their
counsel regarding Section 409A compliance and their need to amend such
arrangements (with the Companys consent) in compliance with Section 409A of
the Code. 

(g) Prior to Closing, Parent and Buyer shall establish, or cause to be
established, a post-Closing bonus plan (the " _Surviving Corporation Bonus
Plan_ ") for certain Company Subsidiary employees, with the participants,
amounts and timing of such payments to be specified by the Company, subject to
Buyers reasonable written consent, provided that an aggregate of up to
$4,000,000 shall be payable under such Surviving Corporation Bonus Plan
following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Surviving Corporation Bonus Plan.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "),
including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the
Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties, prior to
the Effective Time, shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto, and Buyer, following the Effective Time, shall
use its best efforts to defend and respond thereto. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of
any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents),
and any existing indemnification agreements set forth on Section 6.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time or taken at the
request of Buyer.



 

46 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including without
limitation attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, whether pertaining to a matter existing or occurring, or an act or
omission occurring, at or before the Effective Time, and whether asserted or
claimed before, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the
request of Buyer.

(c) Buyer shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time to
continue to be covered for a period of at least six years from the Effective
Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that Buyer
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such;  _provided_ that in no event shall Buyer be required to expend annually
in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company (which current amount is set forth on Section 6.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "),
and _provided further_ that if Buyer is unable to maintain such policy (or
such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Buyer shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable at law
and/or in equity (by injunction, specific performance or otherwise) by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger,
the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective
Subsidiaries shall, at Parents and Buyers sole expense, take all such
reasonably necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
Buyer.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Buyer on the one hand and the
Company on the other shall promptly advise the other parties of any change or
event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause
or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; __  



 

47   _provided_ _further_ __that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any
condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. 

6.10 _No Solicitation_.

(a) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee,
agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any
other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any
merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, assumption of
liabilities, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender
offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative
Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to
herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction, or (iii) enter into any
agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company Board and its representatives may, before the approval
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, and subject to compliance
with the other terms of this Section 6.10, (A) provide information in response
to a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Alternative Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Agreement providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of the assets
(on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the Company Common Stock if the
Company receives from the person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
6.2) (and promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such
information to Buyer to the extent not previously provided to such party);
(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
who has made such an Alternative Proposal; or (C) approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Alternative Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B)
or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action, in light of such
Alternative Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would cause the Company
Board to violate its fiduciary duties (y) in each such case referred to in
clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board has determined in good faith, based
on the information then available and after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Alternative Proposal is a Superior Proposal. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.10(a)_ shall restrict or prohibit any disclosure by the
Company that is required in any document to be filed with the SEC after the
date of this Agreement or any disclosure that, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith is otherwise
required under applicable law. 



 

48 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (w) a
transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than
Buyer or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire
more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or outstanding
voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would
be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from
the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (x)
a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company (other than the Merger), (y) any transaction pursuant to
which any person (or group of persons) (other than Buyer or its affiliates)
acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the
outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of the Company and securities of
the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of the
Companys Subsidiaries) of the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries
representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net
revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately before such transaction, or (z) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of the Company
immediately before such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least
75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power
of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the
consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders
held the shares of Company Common Stock immediately before the consummation
thereof.

(b) The Company shall notify Buyer promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification
of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any
Subsidiary by any person that informs the Company Board or any Subsidiary that
it is considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice
to Buyer shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity
of the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or
considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting nonpublic information
or access to the books and records of the Company or any Subsidiary, and the
material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment
to an Alternative Proposal. The Company shall keep Buyer fully informed, on a
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes
or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours,
notify Buyer, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with _Section
6.10(a)_.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other
than Parent and Buyer) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all persons
other than Parent and Buyer who have been furnished confidential information
regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months before the date hereof
promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company agrees not to, and
to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately
take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been
heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an
Alternative Proposal.



 

49 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.10_ to the contrary, if the
Company receives an Alternative Proposal which the Company Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Buyer,
including pursuant to clause (ii) below, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action or any of the actions described in the following clauses (x), (y)
and (z) would violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law, (x) withdraw, modify or
qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer, the Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), (y) recommend such Superior
Proposal, and/or (z) terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend
its recommendation in a manner adverse to Buyer pursuant to the foregoing
clause (x), recommend such Superior Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause
(y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) (it being
agreed that any such purported termination shall be null and void and of no
effect) unless (A) such Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the
Company of this _Section 6.10_, (B) with respect to clause (z) above, the
Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, and (C): (i)
the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Buyer of its intention
to take any action contemplated in this _Section 6.10(d)_ with respect to
a Superior Proposal at least four Nasdaq Global Select Market trading days in
advance of taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ "), which notice shall
set forth the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and
shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other
material documents, including the then-current form of each definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting
such Change of Recommendation, approving or recommending such Superior
Proposal, or terminating this Agreement to enter into a proposed definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide
Buyer the opportunity to submit an amended written proposal or to make a new
written proposal to the Company Board during the Notice Period and
shall itself and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate in good faith with Buyer (to the extent Buyer so requests in
writing) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any subsequent material revisions to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Buyer and comply
with the requirements of this  _Section 6.10(d)_, and the Notice Period
shall recommence. As used herein, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
un-solicited bona fide Alternative Proposal made in writing involving more
than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the
Company Common Stock that (A) is on terms that the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and financial advisor) are more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than this Agreement, after giving
effect to any modifications (if any) proposed to be made to this Agreement or
any other offer by Buyer after Buyers receipt of notice under this  _Section
6.10(d)_, and (B) which the Company Board has determined in good faith  



 

50  (after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial
advisor) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
(if accepted). The foregoing determinations shall be made after consultation
with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel after taking into
account all appropriate legal, financial (including the financing terms of
such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law.

(e) The Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of the
Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this
_Section 6.10_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.10_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
retained representative) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, at the direction
or with the consent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be
a breach of this _Section 6.10_ by the Company.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit the Company or
its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.11 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of the Company,
Parent and Buyer agrees to exercise good faith and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing

promptly as possible.

6.12 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
coordinate with Parent the declaration of any dividends in respect of Company
Common Stock and the record date and payment date relating thereto, it being
the intention of the parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with
respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

6.13 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party hereto shall knowingly take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if
necessary challenge the applicability or validity of, any purportedly
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party hereto shall
knowingly take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated
hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them shall take
all necessary steps within its control to make those transactions comply with
(or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions.

6.14 _No Rights Triggered_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps
necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or
combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not
and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws, except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or contemplated by this Agreement.



 

51 6.15 _Change in Method_. Parent may at any time change the method of effecting
the combination if and to the extent requested by Parent and consented to by
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or
kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys stockholders as a result
of receiving the Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party
pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in the case Parent proposes a
change of the type referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), the Company may
withhold its consent in its sole discretion.

issued certain capital securities (the " _Trust Preferred Securities_ "), (ii)
the respective Indentures by and between the Company and the Trustees (the "

without limitation being substituted for the Company) and execute any and all
documents, instruments and agreements, including any supplemental indentures,
required by the Indentures, the Trust Agreements, the Guarantee Agreements,

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents of the
Trustees to any supplemental indentures or other documents, instruments or
agreements and to take such other actions as are required to evidence such
assumption by Parent or such Parent Subsidiary, and Parent shall cooperate in
good faith with such efforts.

cooperate before and, solely with respect to Parent and Buyer, after, the
Effective Time to assure, to the extent feasible, compliance with Treasury

described in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c), shall provide one or more

with or furnish to, as applicable, the SEC any and all reports, registration

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion_. Buyer and Parent shall have received the opinion of
their counsel, Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Parent dated the Closing Date, substantially to the
effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth

Effective Time, the Merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, the counsel
may require and rely upon customary representations contained in certificates
of officers of the Company, Buyer and Parent.

(d) _Regulatory Approvals_. All regulatory approvals set forth in  _Section
4.4_ required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force
and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall
have expired (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting

no such regulatory approval shall have resulted in the imposition of any
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

(e) _Employment Agreements_. The employment agreements of each individual set
forth on _Annex A_ shall be in full force and effect and shall not have been
amended and, in each case, such individual shall remain employed by the

this condition shall not be deemed unsatisfied as a result of death or
disability.

Company at or before the Effective Time of the following conditions: 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. Subject to the standard set forth in

forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this

shall be true and correct as of such date), and the Company shall have
received a certificate from each of Buyer and Parent (i) signed on behalf of
Buyer by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer
and (ii) signed on behalf of Parent by the appropriate senior executive
officers of Parent, to the foregoing effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Buyer and Parent_. Each of Buyer and Parent
shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or before the Effective Time, and the
Company shall have received

cash consideration received in the Merger and except with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, no gain
or loss will be recognized by any of the holders of Company Common Stock in
the Merger. Such opinion may note that any persons who as a result of the
consummation of the Merger become "5% stockholders" of Parent at the Effective
Time will qualify for such nonrecognition only if they enter into a "gain
recognition agreement" under regulations promulgated under Section 367 of the
Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely upon customary
representations contained in certificates of officers of the Company, Parent
and Buyer.

covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by
Buyer, or Buyer or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which
breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, and which is
not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party committing
such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time
period, it being understood that in no event shall such period extend beyond

Companys stockholders, (B) taken any public action or made any public

held pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such recommendation or (C)
recommended any Alternative Proposal (or, in the case of clause (ii),
resolved to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the terms
hereof; or

(f) _Failure to Obtain Stockholder Vote_. By either the Company or Buyer, if
the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements
thereof) shall have been convened and a vote to approve this Agreement shall
have been taken thereat and the adoption of the Merger and this Agreement by
the requisite stockholder vote shall not have been obtained (and shall not
have been obtained at any adjournments or postponements thereof); or

(g) _Superior Proposal_. By the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the
requisite stockholder vote, in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, _Section 6.10(d)_.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any clause of
this  _Section 8.1_ (other than clause (a)) shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 9.3_,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.



 

56 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If either the Company or Buyer terminates this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, and none of the Company, Parent, Buyer, any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement,
or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
that (i) _Sections 6.2(b)_, _8.2_ , _8.3_ , _9.3_ , _9.4_ , _9.7_ , _9.8_
 and _9.9_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) none of
the Company, Buyer or Parent shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement. 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_, and except with respect to costs
and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and
other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall
be borne equally by the Company and Buyer, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall pay to Buyer a
termination fee in the amount of $60,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") in
immediately available federal funds if:

(i) (A) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or
_8.1(e)_ , or either Buyer or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_, _and_

(B) (1) before such termination, an Alternative Transaction with respect to
the Company was commenced, publicly proposed or publicly disclosed (or an
Alternative Proposal was received); _and_ (2) within 12 months after such
termination, (x) the Company shall have entered into a definitive written
agreement relating to an Alternative Transaction or (y) an Alternative

the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement and (B) within twelve months
after such receipt, (1) the Company shall have entered into a definitive
written agreement relating to an Alternative Transaction or (2) any
Alternative Transaction shall have been consummated.

Any Termination Fee that becomes payable pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(b)_
shall be promptly paid, within two business days after such amount is owed to
Buyer hereunder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more account(s) specified by Buyer in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall not be entitled to the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section
8.3(b)_ if (i) this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_; or (ii) the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_.



 

57 (c) Upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further
liability to Buyer or Parent at law or in equity with respect to such
termination, or with respect to the Company Boards failure to recommend that
the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, neither Buyer nor Parent would enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay timely any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount
payable to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, the Company shall pay to
Buyer its reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount so payable at the applicable federal funds rate.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may, to the extent legally allowed, be amended
by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, there may not be, without
further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that
(a) alters or changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be
delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, if
such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any security
of the Company, (b) alters or changes any term of the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation if such alteration or change would
adversely affect the holders of any securities of the Company, or (c) alters
or changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such
alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any securities of
the Company, in each case other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at

circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or
when taken together with all other facts, circumstances or
events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in
Article III, in the case of the Company, or Article IV, in the case of Parent

RBC Centura Banks, Inc.

3201 Beechleaf Court

Raleigh, North Carolina 27604 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Alabama National BanCorporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules
and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ ").
I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of September 5, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by
and between the Company, RBC Centura Banks, Inc., a North Carolina
Corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian Chartered Bank
(" _Parent_ "), shall be merged with and into Buyer (the " _Merger_ "). All
terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

I represent, warrant and covenant to Buyer that if I receive any Parent
Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

(a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

(b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I
believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

(c) I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on
a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders
of the Company I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of the Company  



 

A-1  and the distribution by me of Parent Common Stock has not been registered
under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common
Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or
other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations
of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii) in the
opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer, such sale, transfer or
other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

(d) I understand that neither Buyer nor Parent is under any obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by
me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

(e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Buyers
transfer agents with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be
placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to me, or
any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under that
act or an exemption from such registration."

(f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Parent Common Stock
has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend
on the certificates issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

(g) It is understood and agreed that at my request the legends set forth in
paragraphs (e) and (f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Parents
transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above
restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other
period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any
successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions
of such Rule are then available to me; (B) if two years (or such other period
as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any
successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Time and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have
delivered to Parent (1) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission,
or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect
that such legend and/or stop  



 

A-2  transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or
(2) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the
securities represented by such certificates are being or have been
transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under
the Securities Act.

I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I,
my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.

It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect (1) if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms or (2) in the event that Rule 145 promulgated by the
Commission under the Act is amended by the Commission, effective prior to a
sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned,
substantially as proposed in Commission Release No. 33-8813.

Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.
