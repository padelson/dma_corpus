iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of December 23, 2017, by and among: Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish public
limited company (" _Parent_ "); Sun Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "); and Sucampo
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_.

RECITALS

 

A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Class A Common
Stock (the " _Shares_ ") for $18.00 per share, to be paid to the seller in
cash, without interest (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid
pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Offer Price_ "), and subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (i) each issued and outstanding Share (other than any
Cancelled Shares, Converted Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and
subject to any applicable withholding Taxes and (ii) the Company shall become
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

 

C. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger
shall be effected under Section 251(h) and other relevant provisions of the
DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ").

 

D. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively,
to enter into this Agreement.

E. Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger
shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated
following the Offer Acceptance Time as set forth herein.

 

F. As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, certain of the Companys stockholders are entering into a
tender and support agreement with Parent and Purchaser (the " _Support
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, each such stockholder
has agreed to tender Shares (totaling, in the aggregate, approximately 32% of
the outstanding Shares) to Purchaser in the Offer.

 



1\. AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than fifteen
business days after the date of this Agreement (subject to the Company having
timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant to
_Sections 1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer. 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of
Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of
the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (collectively, the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the
" _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement,
the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser and Parent
expressly reserve the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any
Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer
Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease
the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or
modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects, or
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares in its
capacity as such, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, (G) extend or
otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any rescheduled
Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_.

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the first business day
immediately following the 20th business day following the Offer Commencement
Date, determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company)
(the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ," and such date or such subsequent date to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Initial Expiration Date shall be no earlier

 



2\.  than January 31, 2018. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective termination rights
under  _Section_ __ _ 8_: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, Purchaser may, in
its discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other
Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period
of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A)
any period required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position
of the SEC, the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B)
periods of up to ten business days per extension, until any waiting period
(and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under
the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; (iii) if, as of the
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum
Condition) is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the
Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an
additional period of up to ten business days per extension, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (iv) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, the Minimum Condition is not satisfied but all other Offer Conditions
(other than the Offer Condition set forth in clause (f) of _Annex I_ ) have
been satisfied or waived, at the written request of the Company,
Purchaser shall extend the Offer on up to two occasions for an additional
period of up to ten business days per such extension, to permit the Minimum
Condition to be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur
of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this Agreement
in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8_ and (y) the End Date; or (2)
be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the
prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of
the Company except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8_.

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of
the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by either
Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent

 



3\.  required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal
counsel all information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders
that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree
to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff
and a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions with the
SEC or its staff concerning such comments.

(f) Payment; Funds. On the terms specified herein and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser, waiver of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time. Without limiting the
generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, Parent shall cause to be provided to
Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser
to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall
ensure that all of their respective controlled Affiliates shall, tender any
Shares held by them into the Offer.

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(g)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date,
following the filing of the Schedule TO that forms a part of the Offer
Documents, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC and disseminate to holders
of Shares a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that (A) unless the Company Board has made
a Company Adverse Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.1(b)_, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and (B) includes the
notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and
(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 and related documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record
date for purposes of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL. The

 



4\.  Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly
furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or its legal counsel all
information concerning Parent and Purchaser that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.2(a)_. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to participate
in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such comments. The
Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be

requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or

Taxes in the circumstances described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_. Payment
of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed

other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made
available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such Share to any Governmental Body pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock shall be closed and thereafter

Legal Requirements. 

(e) Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, their respective
Affiliates, the Depository Agent and the Paying Agent (and any other

any cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (whether
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger, _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ or otherwise) such
amounts as it is required to deduct or withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Tax Legal Requirements. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and duly paid over to the applicable
Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate),
the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2_.

 



9\. 2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to demand appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands
for appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262
of the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn
nor lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (such
Shares, collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer outstanding, shall cease to
exist and the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in respect of any such
Shares; _provided,_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_), and such shares Shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Purchaser of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and
Purchaser shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations
and Legal Proceedings with respect to any such demands, and the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle,
or make any payment with respect to, any such demands, approve any withdrawal
of any such demands or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and RSUs.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of

the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each
Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price payable per Share under such Company Option, which
amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Any Company Option that has an exercise price per
Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled without consideration.

(b) Each restricted stock unit award and performance stock award granted
pursuant to any of the Company Equity Plans (together, the " _RSUs_ ") that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash
in an amount equal to (i) the total number of Shares underlying such RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the case of performance stock
awards, determined based on "target" levels) multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration, which amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.8(c)_ (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

 



10\. (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than ten days after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to, pay the
aggregate Option Consideration and RSU Consideration payable with respect to
Company Options and RSUs (net of any withholding Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_).

 

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets

Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

the Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and, except as set forth in the

this Agreement, such assessment concluded that such controls were effective
and the Companys independent registered accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the

submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

injunction, directive, order, decree, charge, consent, judgment, covenant not

Companys knowledge, threatened investigation by the FDA pursuant to its

notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_

inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent a Determination Notice at least four business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change in Recommendation; and (C) (1) the
Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail
in the Determination Notice, including the facts and circumstances that
render a Company Adverse Change in Recommendation necessary in the
determination of the Company Board, (2) the Company shall have given Parent
four business days after Parents receipt of the Determination Notice
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal,
and shall have made the Companys Representatives reasonably available to
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives (and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives, to the extent
Parent desires to do so) with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposal, if any, and (3) after considering any such proposals and the results
of any such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent,
if any, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company Board
shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Change in Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also
apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Change in Circumstance, each of which will require a new Determination Notice,
except that the references to four business days shall be deemed to be three
business days.

Agreement.

 

6.3 Company Stock Awards.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Company Equity
Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are
outstanding or otherwise) to (i) provide for the treatment of the Company
Stock Awards contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, (ii) terminate each
Company Equity Plan effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time,
and (iii) cause, as of the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised
Company Option and each RSU then outstanding as of immediately prior to the

applicable, to payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to, contingent on the
Effective Time, (i) ensure that, except for the 12-month offering period under
the ESPP that commenced on January 1, 2017, no offering period or purchase
period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering
period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the
rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering period
(and purchase period thereunder) then underway under the ESPP to be determined
by treating the last business day prior to the Effective Time as the last day
of such offering period and purchase period and by making such other pro rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period and
purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period and
purchase period as a fully effective and completed offering period and
purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP, (iii) no additional purchase
rights shall be granted under the ESPP on and following the date of this
Agreement, and (iv) participants in the ESPP shall be prohibited from
increasing their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this

47\. 6.4 Employee Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the
Company who is employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
(or any Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") a base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities, each of which is no less
favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be) and short-
term cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to Effective Time, and commission opportunities and
benefits (including severance benefits and other employee benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the commission opportunities and
benefits (including severance benefits and other employee benefits) provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing:

(a) Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all purposes,
including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, levels of benefits under Parents and/or the Surviving
Corporations vacation policy) and eligibility for vesting under
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporations employee benefit plans and
arrangements with respect to his or her length of service with the Company
(and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, _provided_
that the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits or apply
for purposes of benefit accrual under any pension plan or to any benefit plan
that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee
population.

 

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or
allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan
of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees, to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would not apply under a similar
employee benefit plan in which such employees participated prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall,
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the Effective Time with the
Company to the same extent that such service and amounts paid was recognized
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit
plan of the Company.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor all Employee Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing at least five business days prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. If Parent requests that any
Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than
two days immediately preceding the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



48\. (e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_
is intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this
Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in
the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by
the Company existing as of the date hereof in favor of those Persons who are
directors and officers of any Acquired Company as of the date of this
Agreement or have been directors and officers of any Acquired Company in the
past (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or applicable governing documents) of
the applicable Acquired Company (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between the
Acquired Company and said Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) in the forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Indemnified Persons, and
shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
fullest extent available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the
Effective Time, and any claim made pursuant to such rights within such six-
year period shall continue to be subject to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ and
the rights provided under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ until disposition of
such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (together
with their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to
the extent described in _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of
an Acquired Company against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified Person as an officer
or director of an Acquired Company in connection with any pending or
threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in whole or in part,
the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of an
Acquired Company at or prior to the Effective Time and pertaining to any
and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including any such matter arising under any claim with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, from the
Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the extent described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees)
incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such
Indemnified Persons are

 



49\.  eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ within
20 days after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject
to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in
favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if
it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
to be indemnified under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_.

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
(i) the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause
Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect, the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of which has been
made available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to
the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons who are
currently covered by such existing policy with respect to their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on terms with respect
to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
the existing policy or (ii) in lieu of becoming subject to the obligations
set forth in the foregoing clause (i), at or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent may (and the Company, upon Parents written request, shall) purchase
a six-year "tail" policy for the policy of the Company in effect as of the
date hereof, with such "tail" policy to be effective as of the Effective Time,
and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.5(c)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300%
of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with respect to such
current policy, it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive the acceptance
of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this _Section_ __
_ 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance
Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written
consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

Legal Proceedings against the Company and/or any of its directors or officers
relating to the Transactions and shall keep Parent apprised on a prompt basis
of any material developments with respect to any such Legal Proceedings. The
Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all material
filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
Legal Proceedings (and the Company shall in good faith take such comments and
other advice into account), and the right to consult in the defense and on
any settlement with respect to any such Legal Proceeding, and the Company
shall in good faith take such consultation into account. No such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (a) make all filings

made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the Company
during the Pre-Closing Period.

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be

Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the
other Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may,
without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response
to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry

Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are consistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other Party); (b) a Party

to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press release or

such portion of any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_; and (d) no Party shall be required
to consult with any other Party in connection with such portion of any press
release, public statement or filing to be issued with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal in the public domain or Company Adverse Change in
Recommendation (provided that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ limits or
otherwise modifies the Companys obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or

as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise
act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the
Transactions.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (and shall subsequently
keep Parent informed on a current basis of any developments related to such

event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to
result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii)
is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7_ or _Annex_ __ _ I_ not being able to be satisfied prior to
the End Date. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company (and shall
subsequently keep the Company informed on a current basis of any developments

of any fact, event or circumstance that (A) has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) is reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7_ not
being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_

covenant, right, remedy or condition to any obligation hereunder.

 

6.10 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Company Board, shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer

6.14 Debt Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser will (and Parent will cause MIFSA to) use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing
on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent necessary to consummate the
Transactions, and will not (and Parent will cause MIFSA not to), without the
Companys prior written consent, amend, modify, replace, terminate or agree to
any waiver under the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification,
replacement, termination or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing to an amount that, together with Purchasers, the Companys and
their respective Affiliates cash and cash equivalents on hand and available
committed credit facilities, would be less than an amount that would be
required to fund the cash payments required to consummate the Transactions or
(ii) changes the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing or adds new or
additional conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing, if such
change would reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the
Closing, (B) make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing on the Closing Date) materially
less likely to occur or (C) materially adversely impact the ability of MIFSA
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may cause MIFSA to (1) amend or
replace the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter to add lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, managers or similar entities who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement

Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement. In the event that new
commitment letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment,
modification or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, such new commitment letters shall be deemed to
be a "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement and
references to "Debt Financing" herein shall include and mean the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended, modified
or replaced, as applicable.

(b) Parent will, and will cause MIFSA to, use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy (or, if
deemed advisable by MIFSA, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions to the Debt Financing that are within Parents control, (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing, and (iv) in the event that the Offer Conditions, the conditions set

that none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives shall be required to provide information concerning the terms
of the Debt Financing for inclusion in such pro forma financial information);

or consent to resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the Debt
Financing and (ii) nothing herein shall require cooperation contemplated

by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-

55\.  with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.14(d)_) and any assistance or activities in
connection therewith, in each case other than to the extent any of the

further appeal) to have arisen from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by, any such Person.

6.15 Payoff Letters. The Company shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Purchaser at least two business days prior to the Closing Date
(and seven business days prior to the Closing Date, drafts of) customary

Legal Requirements, including the giving of any notices that may be required

case as a result of, or in connection with, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby. Through and including the Effective Time, the Company
shall undertake the preparation of, and shall execute and deliver at the times
provided in the Company Indenture, any supplemental indentures,

required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

a supplemental indenture, officers certificate and opinion of counsel
pursuant to Article XI and Sections 10.01, 10.05, 14.07 and 17.05 of the

Company Indenture prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and the Company
shall promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and reflect any
reasonable comments made by, Parent or its counsel with respect thereto prior

however,_ that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement

prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or

to accept a Superior Offer and simultaneously with such termination enter

9.7_, _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and any defined terms used therein may not

a modification, in each case in a manner adverse to the Financing Sources,
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

the other agreements and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject

Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect
(other than the standstill provisions thereof, which shall terminate upon the

no further force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind
the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



61\. 9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i)
each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and
shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and
shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties
hereto); and (ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of
process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.8_. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in
any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by Legal Proceeding on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing
in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 8.3_: (x) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement; and (y) shall not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific performance is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any bond or

ARTICLE IX

The Corporation shall provide indemnification and advancement of expenses as
follows:

Section 1\. _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of
the Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a
party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner,
employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan) (each such person being referred to hereafter as an "
_Indemnitee_ "), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in
a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did
not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 

Section 2\. _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The
Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to
become, a 

 



B-2  director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner,
employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees)
and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted
in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery
of Delaware, or the court in which such action or suit was brought, shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees)
which the Court of Chancery of Delaware, or the court in which such action or
suit was brought, shall deem proper.

Section 3\. _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful
Party_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article IX, to the
extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article IX, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on
appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith.
Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed
of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice),
without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication
that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal
proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe
his conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes
hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.

Section 4\. _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to
an Indemnitees right to be indemnified pursuant to Sections 1, 2 or 3 of this
Article IX, or to receive advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 5 of
this Article IX, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as
soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving
such Indemnitee for which indemnity or advancement of expenses will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After
notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume such
defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in
this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own
counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense
of Indemnitee unless (i) the

 



B-3  employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation,
(ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a
conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the
Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have
employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for
Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Article IX. The Corporation shall not be
entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any
claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for
Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence. The Corporation shall not be required to
indemnify Indemnitee under this Article IX for any amounts paid in settlement
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its written
consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on
Indemnitee without Indemnitees written consent. Neither the Corporation nor
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed
settlement.

Section 5\. _Advance of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Sections 4 and
6 of this Article IX, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or
on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts
so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized
in this Article IX; and _further_ _provided_ that no such advancement of
expenses shall be made under this Article IX if it is determined (in the
manner described in Section 6 of this Article IX) that (i) Indemnitee did not
act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe
his conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference
to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

Section 6\. _Procedure for Indemnification and Advance of Expenses_. In order
to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Sections 1,
2, 3 or 5 of this Article IX, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a
written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and
in any event within 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written
request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the defense
pursuant to Section 4 of this Article IX (and none of the circumstances
described in Section 4 of this Article IX that would nonetheless entitle the
Indemnitee to indemnification or an advancement for the fees and expenses of
separate counsel have occurred), or (ii) the Corporation determines within
such 30 day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Sections 1, 2 or 5 of this Article IX, as the case may
be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with
respect to requests under Section 1 or 2 of this Article IX only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that
the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article IX,
as the case may be.

 



B-4  Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote of
the directors of the Corporation who are not at that time parties to the
action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested directors"), whether
or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by
majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if
there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so
direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law,
be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by
the stockholders of the Corporation.

 

Section 7\. _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of
expenses as granted by this Article IX shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation pursuant to Section 6 of this Article IX that Indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred
in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitees right to advancement
of expenses or indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding
shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

Section 8.  _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article IX, the Corporation
shall not indemnify or advance expenses to an Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article IX in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX, the Corporation
shall not indemnify or advance expenses to an Indemnitee to the extent such
Indemnitee is reimbursed or paid expenses from the proceeds of insurance, and
in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments or advancement
of expenses to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed
from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund
indemnification payments or advancement of expenses to the Corporation to the
extent of such insurance reimbursement.

 

Section 9\. _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of
this Article IX or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish
in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of
expenses under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions,
transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment,
termination or repeal.

 

Section 10\. _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by this Article IX shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while
holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who
has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of

 



B-5  Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article IX shall be deemed to
prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into,
agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification and
advancement rights and procedures different from those set forth in this
Article IX. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from
time to time by its Board, grant indemnification and advancement rights to
other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the
Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than,
those set forth in this Article IX.

 

Section 11\. _Partial Indemnification and Advance of Expenses_. If an
Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article IX to
indemnification or advancement of expenses by the Corporation for some or a
portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify or advance expenses to Indemnitee for
the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

Section 12.  _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 13\. _Savings Clause_. If this Article IX or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of
the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of
this Article IX that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

Section 14.  _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h)
and Section 145(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section
145(h) and Section 145(i).

SECTION 1. ANNUAL MEETINGS  Annual meetings of stockholders for the election

the meeting, shall be held at such place, either within or without the State
of Delaware, and at such time and date as the Board of Directors, by
resolution, shall determine and as set forth in the notice of the meeting. If
the Board of Directors fails so to determine the time, date and place of
meeting, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at the registered
office of the Corporation on the first Tuesday in April. If the date of the
annual meeting shall fall upon a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held on

entitled to vote shall elect a Board of Directors and they may transact such
other corporate business as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.

SECTION 2. SPECIAL MEETINGS  Special meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called by the Chairman, the President or the
Secretary, or by resolution of the Board of Directors.

SECTION 3. VOTING  Each stockholder entitled to vote in accordance with the
terms of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation and these By-Laws
may vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after three
years from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. All
elections for directors shall be decided by plurality vote; all other
questions shall be decided by majority vote except as otherwise provided by
the Certificate of Incorporation or the laws of the State of Delaware.

A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged

held by each, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period
of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice
of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to
be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of
the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is entitled to be present.

 



C-1 SECTION 4. QUORUM  Except as otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or by these By-Laws, the presence, in person
or by proxy, of stockholders holding shares constituting a majority of the
voting power of the Corporation shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders. In case a quorum shall not be present at any meeting, a
majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until the
requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be present. At any such
adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote
shall be represented, any business may be transacted that might have been

entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to
vote at any adjournment or adjournments thereof.

time of the meeting, and the general nature of the business to be considered,
shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, at his or her
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, not less than ten nor
more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. No business other
than that stated in the notice shall be transacted at any meeting without the
unanimous consent of all the stockholders entitled to vote thereat.

 

SECTION 6. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING  Unless otherwise provided by the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders
of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the
taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in
writing.

 

ARTICLE III

DIRECTORS 

SECTION 1. NUMBER AND TERM  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors which shall consist of
not less than one person. The exact number of directors shall initially be
three and may thereafter be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders and each
director shall be elected to serve until his or her successor shall be elected
and shall qualify. A director need not be a stockholder.

 

SECTION 2. RESIGNATIONS  Any director may resign at any time. Such
resignation shall be made in writing, and shall take effect at the time
specified therein, and if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by
the Chairman, the President or the Secretary. The acceptance of a resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective.

 



C-2 SECTION 3. VACANCIES  If the office of any director becomes vacant, the
remaining directors in the office, though less than a quorum, by a majority
vote, may appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, who shall hold
office for the unexpired term and until his or her successor shall be duly
chosen. If the office of any director becomes vacant and there are no
remaining directors, the stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders
of shares constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation, at a
special meeting called for such purpose, may appoint any qualified person to
fill such vacancy.

SECTION 4. REMOVAL  Except as hereinafter provided, any director or directors
may be removed either for or without cause at any time by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power entitled to vote for the
election of directors, at an annual meeting or a special meeting called for
the purpose, and the vacancy thus created may be filled, at such meeting, by
the affirmative vote of holders of shares constituting a majority of the
voting power of the Corporation.

 

SECTION 5. COMMITTEES  The Board of Directors may, by resolution or
resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate
one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of
the Corporation.

Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors, or in these By-Laws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business
and affairs of the Corporation.

SECTION 6. MEETINGS  The newly elected directors may hold their first meeting
for the purpose of organization and the transaction of business, if a quorum
be present, immediately after the annual meeting of the stockholders; or the
time and place of such meeting may be fixed by consent of all the Directors.

 

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such
places and times as shall be determined from time to time by resolution of
the Board of Directors.

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman or
the President, or by the Secretary on the written request of any director, on
at least one days notice to each director (except that notice to any director
may be waived in writing by such director) and shall be held at such place or
places as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or as shall be stated
in the notice of the meeting.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation or these By-Laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any
committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in any meeting
of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a
meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 



C-3 SECTION 7. QUORUM  A majority of the Directors shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. If at any meeting of the Board of Directors
there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained, and no
further notice thereof need be given other than by announcement at the
meeting which shall be so adjourned. The vote of the majority of the Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board of Directors unless the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
or these By-Laws shall require the vote of a greater number.

 

SECTION 8. COMPENSATION  Directors shall not receive any stated salary for
their services as directors or as members of committees, but by resolution of
the Board of Directors a fixed fee and expenses of attendance may be allowed
for attendance at each meeting. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
as an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.

SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING  Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may
be taken without a meeting if a written consent thereto is signed by all
members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be,
and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
Board of Directors or such committee.

form and device as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

SECTION 2. LOST CERTIFICATES  A new certificate of stock may be issued in
the place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation, alleged
to have been lost or destroyed, and the Board of Directors may, in its
discretion, require the owner of the lost or destroyed certificate, or such

Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first day on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or,

C-6 SECTION 8. NOTICE AND WAIVER OF NOTICE  Whenever any notice is required to be

so stated, and any notice so required shall be deemed to be sufficient if
given by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the person entitled thereto at his or her address as it appears
on the records of the Corporation, and such notice shall be deemed to have
been given on the day of such mailing. Stockholders not entitled to vote shall
not be entitled to receive notice of any meetings except as otherwise
provided by law. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the
provisions of any law, or under the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or of these By-Laws, a waiver thereof, in
writing and signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to such
required notice.

 

ARTICLE VI

alteration, amendment or repeal to be considered is contained in the notice of
such special meeting) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares
constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation. Except as
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the
Board of Directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at
which a quorum is present alter, amend or repeal these By-Laws, or enact such
other By-Laws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation and
