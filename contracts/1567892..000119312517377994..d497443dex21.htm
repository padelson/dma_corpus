(a)&nbsp;the executed Debt Commitment Letter and (b)&nbsp;the executed Debt Fee Letter (redacted as to economic and &#147;flex&#148; terms only). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Mallinckrodt International Finance S.A. (&#147;<B><I>MIFSA</I></B>&#148;), an Affiliate of Purchaser (and Subsidiary of Parent), on the terms in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Purchaser) has entered into any side letters or other agreements or arrangements related to the Debt Financing which would (i)&nbsp;reduce
the amount of the Debt Financing or (ii)&nbsp;impose new or additional conditions or other contingencies to funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is
in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of MIFSA, and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)&nbsp;laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and (ii)&nbsp;rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or modified (other than
as permitted by <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;6.14(a)</U>). The net proceeds of the Debt Financing, if funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with cash and cash equivalents available to Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Affiliates, including under committed credit facilities available to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, shall, in the aggregate, be sufficient to fund the cash payments required to consummate the Transactions upon the terms contemplated
by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser has no reason to believe that MIFSA will be unable to satisfy any term or condition to be satisfied by it as a condition to the availability of the Debt Financing contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, nor any reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to borrowing under any committed credit facilities available to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates will not be satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition on the part of MIFSA (or to MIFSA&#146;s knowledge, any other party thereto) under the
Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the Offer or the Merger are not subject to a condition that any financing be received by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for the consummation of the
Transactions. Assuming (i)&nbsp;the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;7</U> and <U>Annex</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;I</U> of this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the accuracy as of the Effective Time of all of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement, (iii)&nbsp;the performance by the Company of all of its obligations under this Agreement and (iv)&nbsp;all estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by or on behalf of the Company
that have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions that were reasonable when made and continue to be reasonable, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the payment of
the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent will be Solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. </P>
