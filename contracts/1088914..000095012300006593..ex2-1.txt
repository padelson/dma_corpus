qualified or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
Laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Buyer Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are chosen and have

Section 1.10, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares of Company Stock held
of record by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time), shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Cash
Consideration (as defined below) and the Escrow Consideration (as defined
below) and the Tax Refund Consideration (as defined below):   (i) Cash
Consideration. In addition to  being converted into the right to receive the
Escrow  Consideration and the Tax Refund Consideration, each such  issued
and outstanding share of Company Stock (other than  Dissenting Shares) shall
also be converted into the right to  receive the following amount in cash,
without interest (the  "Cash Consideration"):   (x) (A) one hundred
eighteen  million dollars ($118,000,000), minus (B) the amount  of Borrowed
Money Debt immediately prior to the  Effective Time (after giving effect to
any  application of Cash to reduce such Borrowed Money  Debt on the Closing
Date prior to the Effective  Time), minus (C) the amount of Company
Transaction  Expenses (pursuant to Section 11.04 hereof), and plus  (D) the
aggregate exercise prices of Company Stock  Options outstanding as of the
Effective Time, divided  by   (y) (A) the number of shares of  Company
Stock issued and outstanding as of the  Effective Time (including without
limitation shares  of Company Stock held of record by Buyer or Buyer 
Subsidiary as of the Effective Time and all  Dissenting Shares), plus (B) the
aggregate number of  shares of Company Stock issuable upon exercise of 
Company Warrants and Company Stock Options  outstanding as of the Effective
Time, plus (c) the  aggregate number of Reference Shares covered by the

result of this clause (y),  the "Fully Diluted Equity Number").   (ii)
Escrow Consideration. In addition  to being converted into the right to
receive the Cash  Consideration and the Tax Refund Consideration, each such 
issued and outstanding share of Company Stock shall also be  converted into a
0.00005328002% interest in the Escrow Funds  (the "Escrow

converted into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration and the Escrow
Consideration, each such issued  and outstanding share of Company Stock shall
also be converted       3  9  into a fractional interest in any
Available Tax Refund (as  defined below) (the "Tax Refund Consideration"),
such fraction  to be determined by dividing one (1) by the difference 
obtained by reducing the Fully Diluted Equity Number by the  number of shares
subject to Rollover Options. For purposes of  this Agreement, "Available Tax
Refund" shall mean any tax  refund payable to the Selling Parties as
determined pursuant  to Article IX and Section 1.14 hereof and as paid

Benefit Bonus (as defined in the Option and SAR Cancellation  Agreement)

hereof shall not be  considered part of the Available Tax Refund.   The sum

Consideration as determined pursuant to this Section 1.05(a) is referred to
herein as the "Per Share Merger Consideration."   At the Closing, the chief
financial officer of the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Selling
Parties\' Representative, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations
of (x) the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.05(a)(i) above, (y) the
percentages representing the respective interests of the Selling Parties in
the Escrow Funds, and (z) the fraction to be utilized in calculating the
respective interests of the Selling Parties in the Tax Refund Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.05(a)(iii) above.   (b) Each Dissenting Share shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the fair value thereof
determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.   (c) Each share of
common stock of Buyer Subsidiary issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving
Corporation Common Stock"), which shall constitute the only issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding
certificate previously representing shares of common stock of
Buyer Subsidiary shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership and
to represent the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock.   (d) Each share of Company Stock held of record by Buyer, Buyer
Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer
or the Company as of the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   (e)
Each share of Company Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.       4  10  1.06
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each share (if any) of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time for which the holder has the right to
demand, and has made a demand for, appraisal of such share under Section 262
of the DGCL (each a "Dissenting Share") shall not be converted into the right
to receive its Per Share Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time,
and the Company shall therefore have no obligation to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of any such Dissenting Share, unless and
until the holder of such shares withdraws his demand for dissenters\'
rights or becomes ineligible for dissenters\' rights. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect (or otherwise loses) any such right
to appraisal, then each such share of such holder shall be treated as a share
that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Buyer of each demand received by the Company for appraisal
of Company Stock, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in
negotiations and proceedings regarding each such demand. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, settle or make any
payment regarding any such demand. Each person holding of record or
beneficially owning Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262
of the DGCL and this Section 1.06 to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares (and any other payments required by Section 262 of the
DGCL) shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation.   1.07

and the Option and SAR Cancellation Agreement, (y) an acknowledgement,
contained in the Option and SAR Cancellation Agreement, that such holder has
a right to receive an amount equal to the Tax Refund Consideration for each
share of Class A Common Stock covered by his Purchased Options as a
contingent bonus if, as and when received and paid by the Company for the
benefit of the Selling Parties pursuant to Section 9.02(b) hereof. The

Buyer shall be entitled to collect from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to
the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Closing Net
Working Capital. Any amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 1.12 will be
treated as an adjustment to the merger consideration hereunder for all
purposes and shall be solely satisfied out of the Escrow Fund.   1.13
DETERMINATION OF CLOSING NET WORKING CAPITAL.   (a) The "Closing Net Working
Capital" means the Net Working Capital as of the opening of business on the
Closing Date, as determined in accordance with Sections 1.13(b), (c) and (d)
below.   (b) On the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date the Company will complete a full physical inventory of the
Company. The Buyer and the Buyer\'s Accountant (as defined below) shall be
entitled to be present while the inventory review is being conducted. On
or before the 60th day after the Closing Date, the Selling
Parties\' Representative, on behalf of the Selling Parties will cause to be
prepared a balance sheet as of the opening of business on the Closing Date
(without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby), which
shall be audited by Arthur Andersen LLP (the "Sellers\' Accountant")
(together with the related audit report of such firm, the "Closing Balance
Sheet"), and which shall set forth a calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, and the Selling Parties\' Representative will promptly deliver a
copy of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Buyer. To the extent not previously
paid at Closing as a Transaction Expense, all fees and expenses in connection
with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, including the fees of the
Sellers\' Accountant, shall be for the Selling Parties\' account and shall be
paid from interest earned on the Escrow Fund, as provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Closing Balance Sheet shall (x) be prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistent with the preparation of the historical financial statements
of the Company and (y) fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of the Company as of the Closing Date. During such 60-day period,
the Buyer will cause the Company to provide the Selling Parties\'
Representative and the Sellers\' Accountant reasonable access to the
Company\'s records. During the 30-day period immediately following the
Selling Parties\' Representative\'s delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet,
the Selling Parties\' Representative will use commercially reasonable best
efforts to provide the Buyer and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Buyer\'s
Accountant") reasonable access to the Sellers\' Accountant, and the work
papers related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital. On or prior to the 30th day
following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Selling Parties\'
Representative, the Buyer may give the Selling Parties\' Representative a
written notice stating in reasonable detail the Buyer\'s objections (an
"Objection Notice") to the Closing Balance Sheet. Any Objection Notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis
therefor. Any determination       9  15 expressly set forth on the
Closing Balance Sheet which is not specifically objected to in the Objection
Notice shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties upon delivery of
the Objection Notice. If the Buyer does not give the Selling Parties\'
Representative an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the
Closing Balance Sheet will be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet
will constitute the Closing Net Working Capital for purposes of Section
1.13(a) above.   (c) If the Buyer gives a timely Objection Notice
as described in Section 1.13(b) above, then the Buyer and the Selling
Parties\' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disputes regarding the Closing Balance Sheet.   (d) If the Buyer and the
Selling Parties\' Representative are unable to resolve all disputes regarding
the Closing Net Working Capital on or prior to the 45th day after the
Objection Notice is given, then the Buyer and the Selling Parties\'
Representative will retain a firm of certified public accountants chosen
randomly by lot from among the "big five" accounting firms other than the
Sellers\' Accountant and the Buyer\'s Accountant (the "Independent Accounting
Firm") to determine the Closing Net Working Capital as soon as practicable.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall only decide the specific items under
dispute by the Parties and shall be instructed to determine the Closing Net
Working Capital in accordance with the principles set forth in
this Agreement. The Closing Net Working Capital determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
and will constitute the Closing Net Working Capital for purposes of Section
1.12 above. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in
connection with its determination of the Closing Net Working Capital will be
paid one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the Selling Parties from the
interest earned on the Escrow Fund, as provided in the Escrow Agreement.  
(e) Upon the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Buyer and the Selling Parties\' Representative agree to prepare, execute and
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent (pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement) with respect to the distribution a portion of the
Escrow Fund to Buyer, if necessary under the terms of Sections 1.12 and 1.13
hereof.   1.14 CLOSING TAX RETURNS.   (a) On or before the 30th day after
final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet (including the related audit
report) as contemplated by Section 1.13 above, the Selling Parties\'
Representative, on behalf of the Selling Parties, will cause to be prepared
the Company\'s federal income tax return(s) (along with any state and/or
local income tax returns) for any taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date with respect to which the Company has not filed its federal
income tax return (or state and/or local income tax returns) prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the "Closing Tax Returns"). The Selling Parties\'
Representative will promptly deliver copies of the Closing Tax Returns to the
Buyer for filing by Buyer. To the extent not previously paid at Closing as a
Transaction Expense, all fees and expenses of the Sellers\' Accountant in
connection with the preparation of the Closing Tax Returns shall be for the
Selling Parties\' account and shall be paid from interest earned on the
Escrow Fund, as provided in the Escrow Agreement. The Closing Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance       10  16 with applicable law and
in keeping with the past custom and practice of the Company. During the
period required for preparing the Closing Tax Returns, the Buyer will cause
the Company to provide the Selling Parties\' Representative and the Sellers\'
Accountant reasonable access to the Company\'s records and reasonable
assistance in providing information for the preparation of the Closing Tax
Returns. During the 30-day period immediately following the Selling Parties\'
Representative\'s delivery of the Closing Tax Returns, the Selling Parties\'
Representative will use commercially reasonable best efforts to provide the
Buyer and the Buyer\'s Accountant reasonable access to the Sellers\'
Accountant, and the work papers related to the preparation of the Closing Tax
Returns.   (b) If Buyer objects to the content of the Closing Tax Returns,
Buyer may give the Selling Parties\' Representative a written notice stating
in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the
basis therefor, with the same effect and requirements as if the Closing Tax
Returns were the Closing Date Balance Sheet under Section 1.13(b) above.
Similarly, any dispute regarding the Closing Tax Returns shall be resolved
under Sections 1.13(c) and (d) utilizing the same procedures as if such
dispute involved the determination of Closing Net Working Capital.   (c)
Upon the final determination of the content of the Closing Tax Returns (and
the amount, if any, of income tax owed by the Company with respect to the
taxable periods covered by the Closing Tax Returns), the Selling Parties
shall pay to the Company the aggregate amount of income taxes owed by the
Company (as shown on the Closing Tax Returns), reduced by the amount of any
timely estimated tax payments made by the Company with respect to the taxable
periods covered by the Closing Tax Returns.   (d) Buyer hereby represents
that Buyer is a member of an Affiliated Group entitled to file consolidated
tax returns with members of such Affiliated Group for federal income tax
purposes and has properly elected to be classified as an association taxed as
a corporation for income tax purposes. Buyer agrees to include the Company in
the consolidated federal income tax return of its Affiliated Group for the
year 2000 beginning the day after the Closing Date and ending December 31,
2000. Buyer agrees that the Closing Tax Returns described in Section 1.14(a)
shall be filed for the period beginning January 1, 2000 and ending on the
Closing Date.   1.15 DIXIE BEDDING ESCROW ACCOUNT. Reference is made to the
Dixie Purchase Agreement and the related Escrow Agreement dated March
17, 1998 by and among Dixie Bedding, the Company and North Carolina Trust
Company (the "Dixie Escrow Agreement"). The Dixie Purchase Agreement provides
for, among other things, certain potential indemnification claims against
Dixie Bedding by the Company (the "Potential Dixie Indemnification Claims").
The Dixie Escrow Agreement creates an escrow fund (the "Dixie Escrow Fund")
that is a source of payment for such potential indemnification claims. The
potential indemnification claims against Dixie Bedding generally expired on
September 17, 1999, but certain potential claims continue beyond such date
and will extend beyond the Closing Date. Subject to pending claims, if any,
the Dixie Escrow Agreement and the related Dixie Escrow Fund will terminate
on September 17, 2000. On the Closing Date, the Company will assign the
Potential Dixie Indemnification Claims and the Company\'s related rights
under the       11  17 Escrow Agreement to the Selling Parties\'
Representative, acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the Selling
Parties. Such assignment agreement shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, Buyer and Selling Parties\' Representative. As
of the date hereof, the Company represents and warrants to Buyer that there
are no pending indemnification claims against Dixie Bedding under the Dixie
Purchase Agreement or the Dixie Escrow Agreement.    ARTICLE II

any Confidential Information unless and to the extent that the aforementioned
matters become generally known to and available for use by the public other
than as a result of Marathon Fund III\'s acts or omissions to act. Marathon
Fund III further agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts and
diligence to safeguard the Confidential Information and to protect it against
disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss or theft.   5.13 NONSOLICITATION.  
(i) For a period of 5 years following the Closing Date, neither Marathon Fund
III nor any of its Affiliates shall directly or indirectly (x) induce or
attempt to induce any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary to leave the
employ of the Company or any Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the

including, inducing or attempting to induce any union, employee or group of
employees to interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (y) hire any person who was a key employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary unless at least six months has elapsed since the termination

circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration or
scope reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated
duration or scope and that the court shall be allowed to revise the
restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period and scope permitted
by law.   (iv) Marathon Fund III recognizes and affirms that in the event
of its breach of any provision of this Section 5.13, money damages would be
inadequate and the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation would have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, Marathon Fund III agrees that in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Marathon Fund III or any of its Affiliates
of any of the provisions of this Section 5.13, the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation, in addition and supplementary to other rights and remedies
existing in their favor, may apply to any court of law or equity of competent
jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof (without
posting a bond or other security).   5.14 FINANCING. Buyer will use its

the case of the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors);   (b) by
Buyer or the Company (in the case of the Company, as approved by its Board of
Directors) if the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have been
consummated on or before July 31, 2000 (which date may be extended by mutual
agreement of Buyer and the Company (in the case of the Company, as approved
by its Board of Directors)), provided that such failure is not due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement (or, in the event
Buyer is seeking to terminate this Agreement, of Buyer Subsidiary) to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement;   (c) by Buyer, if any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01 hereof shall become impossible to

representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement and except

CONSIDERATION   9.01 TAX REFUNDS ARISING FROM CURRENT YEAR LOSSES.
The Company anticipates that it will realize a net operating loss for the tax
year ending on the Closing Date (the "NOL"). Such NOL may entitle the Company
to refunds of certain taxes paid with respect to the year ended as of the
Closing Date, and any unused NOL can be carried back to prior years and will
create refunds of taxes paid with respect to those years. Buyer agrees that
any income tax refunds resulting directly from the carryback of the NOL
received with respect to tax years ending on or before the Closing Date shall
be for the account of the Selling Parties. As promptly as practicable, Buyer
shall cause the Company to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to
which the Selling Parties are entitled under this Section 9.01. Buyer shall
permit the Selling Parties\' Representative, on behalf of the Selling
Parties, to control the prosecution of any such refund claim and, where
deemed appropriate by the Selling Parties\' Representative, shall cause Buyer
to authorize by appropriate powers of attorney such person as the Selling
Parties\' Representative shall designate to represent the Company with
respect to such refund claim.   9.02 PAYMENT OF TAX REFUND(s). Any tax
refund(s) received by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01 shall be paid as
follows within ten (10) days after any such refund is received by the
Company:   (a) first, an amount equal to the Tax Benefit Bonus (as defined

RETURNS AFFECTING NOL. Except as required by law, Buyer shall not amend any
income Tax Return or election made in connection with such return for any

anticipated refunds to be received from the carryback of such NOL.

performed before the Effective Time; in the case of each of (a) and (b)
however, excluding those breaches or failures (if any) with respect to which
any Selling Party can establish that Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary had actual
knowledge at the time of Closing. For purposes of this Section 10.01, in
determining whether a breach of any representation or warranty has occurred
and the amount of any Losses, any materiality qualification in any such
representation or warranty shall be ignored and given no effect.   10.02

of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary contained in
this Agreement or (b) the breach or failure to perform by Buyer or

both (a) and (b), however, excluding those breaches or failures (if any) with
respect to which the Buyer can establish that the Company had
actual knowledge at the time of Closing.   10.03 NOTICE OF THIRD-PARTY
CLAIMS. In no case shall any Indemnitor under this Agreement be liable with
respect to any Third-Party Claim against any Indemnitee unless the Indemnitee
shall have delivered to the Indemnitor a Claim Notice and the following
conditions are satisfied:   (a) TIMELY DELIVERY OF CLAIM NOTICE. Except as
provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 10.03, and subject to
Section 10.07 below, no right to indemnification under this Article X shall
be available to the Indemnitee with respect to a Third-Party Claim unless the
Indemnitee shall have delivered to the Indemnitor, with a copy to the Escrow
Agent, promptly upon receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding or
claim against it a notice ("Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail
the facts giving rise to such Third-Party Claim and stating that the
Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification for such Third-Party Claim from
the Indemnitor pursuant to this Article X.   (b) LATE DELIVERY OF CLAIM
NOTICE. If, in the case of a Third-Party Claim, a Claim Notice is not given
promptly to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall nevertheless be entitled to
be indemnified under this Article X except to the extent (but only to the
extent) that the Indemnitor has been actually prejudiced by such time
elapsed.   (c) PAID OR SETTLED CLAIMS. If a Claim Notice is not given by
the Indemnitee prior to the payment or settlement by the Indemnitee of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall only be entitled to be
indemnified under this Article X to the extent (and only to the extent) that
the Indemnitee can establish that the Indemnitor has not been prejudiced by
such payment or settlement.   10.04 DEFENSE OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. Upon
receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee with respect to any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnitor may assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects in such defense. The Indemnitee shall at all times have
the right to employ separate counsel in any action or claim and to
participate in or undertake and control the defense thereof, provided that
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall be at the
expense of the Indemnitor only if such counsel is retained pursuant to the
following sentence or if the employment of such counsel has been specifically
authorized by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee shall have the right to control
the defense at the expense of the Indemnitor the claim with counsel of its
choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, if (i) the Indemnitor
does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Claim Notice that the Indemnitor elects to undertake the defense thereof;
(ii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
(iii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnitee that would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on
business; (iv) the Indemnitor failed or is failing to prosecute or defend
vigorously such claim. If the Indemnitor has assumed control over the defense
of a claim from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall have the right to settle
any such claim over the objection of the Indemnitor only if the      
38  44 Indemnitee waives any right to indemnity therefor. So long as the
Indemnitor is controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Indemnitee agrees that Indemnitor shall have full
and complete control over the conduct of such proceeding, except that
the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice.   10.05 NOTICE
OF OTHER CLAIMS. In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim against any
Indemnitor hereunder that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted
against or sought to be collected from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall
notify the Indemnitor, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, with reasonable
promptness of such claim by the Indemnitee, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such claim and the amount or the estimated amount of such
claim. The Indemnitor shall remit payment for the amount of such claim upon
receipt of an invoice therefor, or in the event of a dispute, the Indemnitee
and the Indemnitor shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with Section 11.15 hereof.   10.06 ACCESS AND
COOPERATION. After the Closing Date, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, on
the one hand, and the Selling Parties, on the other hand, shall each
cooperate fully with the other as to all claims for indemnification
hereunder, shall make available to the other as reasonably requested all
information, books, records and documents that may be potentially relevant to
any and all claims and shall preserve all such information, books, records
and documents until the termination of any claim. Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Selling Parties, on the other hand,
shall each also make available to the other, as reasonably requested,
its personnel, agents and other representatives who are responsible for
preparing or maintaining information, books, records or other documents, or
who may have particular knowledge with respect to any claim.   10.07 TERM
OF INDEMNITIES. Except as hereinafter expressly provided, the right to
indemnification under Section 10.01 shall expire twenty (20) months following
the Closing Date; provided, however, that such limitation shall not be
applicable to an indemnification claim for which a Claim Notice was given
within the twenty (20)-month period following the Closing Date. Any such
pending claim shall survive in respect of that claim until the
final determination or settlement of that claim.   10.08 LIMITATIONS ON
LIABILITY.   (a) REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE. Except as specifically provided for in
the last sentence of this Section 10.08(a), each of the Buyer,
Buyer Subsidiary and the Selling Parties acknowledge and agree that, should
the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy of each party hereto against
any other party hereto with respect to any and all claims arising out of
this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article X. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
except for common law fraud, (i) Buyer,       39  45 Buyer Subsidiary
and the Surviving Corporation shall have no recourse against the Company\'s
officers, directors or agents with respect to any claims arising out of this
Agreement other than in their capacities as Selling Parties otherwise
entitled to receive distributions from the Escrow Funds under the Escrow
Agreement, and (ii) indemnification owing from any Selling Party who is or
was an officer or director of the Company shall not be deemed for any purpose
to be a claim covered by indemnification owing to such by the Company under
any law, by-law or agreement whatsoever. This Section 10.08(a) shall
not apply to limit any of the following claims: (x) claims based upon common
law fraud; (y) claims against Marathon Fund III under Section 5.12 or 5.13
hereof; (z) any claims based upon individual representations regarding title,
authority and ownership as provided in the Option and SAR Cancellation
Agreement, in any letter of transmittal signed by any of the Selling Parties,
or in any separate cancellation agreement with the holders of Company
Warrants; or (xx) claims for specific performance.   (b) DEDUCTIBLE. Except
as hereinafter expressly provided,   (i) Except as provided in paragraph
(b)(iii) below, no claim for indemnification under Section 10.01 shall be
made by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach
resulting in an individual item of Loss, or related items of Losses arising
out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless and until the
amount of such Loss(es) suffered by the Surviving Corporation and/or the
Buyer exceeds $10,000, at which point a claim can be made for the entire
amount of such Loss(es); and   (ii) Except as provided in paragraph
(b)(iii) below, no claim for indemnification under Section 10.01 shall be
made by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation unless and until the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which claims are allowed under Section 10.08(b)(i)
suffered by the Surviving Corporation and/or the Buyer exceeds $750,000 (the
"Aggregate Deductible"), and then only to the extent the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.   (iii) Paragraphs (b)(i)
and (b)(ii) above shall not apply to limit any indemnification claim by Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation in respect of any breach of any representation
or warranty included in any of Sections 3.02 (Capitalization), 3.03
(Authorization and Execution), 3.07 (Taxes), 3.16 (No Brokers or Finders),
3.17 (Affiliate Transactions) or 3.18 (Indebtedness). In addition, in
determining whether a breach of any representation or warranty in any of
these sections has occurred for purposes of paragraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii)
above and for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses, any
materiality qualification in any such representation or warranty shall be
ignored and given no effect.   (c) LIABILITY LIMITED TO ESCROW FUNDS. Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation shall have recourse only against the
undisbursed Escrow Funds with respect to any Losses, in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Selling Parties shall have no liability
separate from, or in addition to, the Escrow Funds, except as to the parties
and matters described in the last sentence of Section 10.08(a).      
40  46  10.09 ESCROW AMOUNT AND TERM.   (a) At the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall deposit eight million five hundred thousand dollars ($8,500,000)
(the "Escrow Funds") with an escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Selling
Parties\' Representative and the Buyer (the "Escrow Agent") under an Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, but such
Escrow Agreement shall include such additional changes as shall be requested
by the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Agent\'s obligations,
liabilities and responsibilities and shall be approved by the Company and
Buyer (such approval to be conclusively established by the execution and
delivery thereof by an authorized corporate officer of each of the Company
and Buyer) (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Funds shall remain deposited
with the Escrow Agent and shall be subject to and payable in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.   (b) Except as
provided in Section 10.09(c) below, the Escrow Agreement will provide that,
on the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (the "First
Scheduled Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release from escrow and
deliver to the Selling Parties an aggregate amount equal to four million two
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($4,250,000) of the Escrow Funds. Such
aggregate amount shall be distributed to the respective members of the
Selling Group in proportion to the respective amounts of the Escrow
Consideration payable to each of them. Except as provided in Section 10.09(c)
below, the remaining Escrow Funds shall be released from escrow on the date
that is twenty (20) months from the Closing Date (the "Second
Scheduled Release Date") and the Escrow Agreement shall terminate on such
date.   (c) If there are outstanding indemnification claims on the First
Scheduled Release Date, and the remaining Escrow Funds would not cover the
amount of such pending claims, then an additional amount adequate to cover
such pending claims shall be withheld by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Funds to be distributed on the First Scheduled Release Date for as
long as required to cover such pending claims. If there are
outstanding indemnification claims on the Second Scheduled Release Date, an
amount adequate to cover such pending claims shall be withheld by the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Funds, and the Escrow Agreement shall continue, for as
long as required to cover such pending claims.    ARTICLE XI

the Company, or by Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, respectively, but such waiver
