(i) $240.0 million (the " _Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration_ "),

the portion of the Closing Cash Merger Consideration set aside as Closing
Escrowed Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(b) and less the Expenses
Reserve set aside pursuant to Section 1.9(b); and

(B) an additional $108.0 million, payable, at ParentÂ’s option and sole

combination thereof (the " _Additional Closing Merger Consideration_ "); and

(C) the distributions of the Closing Escrowed Merger Consideration and the
remainder of the Expenses Escrow Account, together with earnings thereon,

_First Year Deferred Payment_ ") and (B) a second year deferred payment
(calculated and payable as set forth below, the " _Second Year Deferred
Payment_ "; collectively with the First Year Deferred Payment the " _Deferred
Payments_ "); provided, however that, to the extent Parent has received
distributions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or has asserted unresolved
claims for indemnification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement for Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(a) that collectively
exceed $12.0 million in the aggregate on or prior to the First Year Payment
Date, at ParentÂ’s election, the amount of such claimed Losses in excess of
$12.0 million (which excess amount shall not exceed $12.0 million in the
aggregate) may be subtracted from the First Year Deferred Payment and
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to
be distributed as provided therein; provided, further, however, that to the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 4  election, the full amount of such claimed Losses in excess of $12.0 million
may be subtracted from any Deferred Payments not yet paid and shall be
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to be
distributed as provided therein (all such additional amounts so deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (the " _Deferred Payment
Escrow Amount")_.

The Aggregate Merger Consideration is subject to adjustment as set forth
herein and is to be distributed as set forth in  _Exhibit C_.

(b) _Escrowed Merger Consideration_. Of the Closing Cash Merger Consideration
$12,000,000 shall constitute escrowed merger consideration (the " _Closing
Escrowed Merger Consideration_ "; together with the Deferred Payment Escrow
Amount, the " _Escrowed Merger Consideration"_ ).

(c) _Adjustments to Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration_.

(i) _Adjustments for Company Transaction Costs_. Any Company Transaction Costs
incurred or accrued by the Company in excess of $4,150,000 in connection with
the Merger on or prior to the Closing shall be deducted from the Closing Cash
Merger Consideration, and, at the Closing, provided that the Company has
provided Parent with documentation reasonably sufficient to substantiate the
Company Transaction Costs for the sole purpose of confirming the amount
and not the reasonableness of any such costs, Parent shall deliver the amount
equal to the Company Transaction Costs (up to $4,150,000) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Company at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date. Any Company
Transaction Costs which become due as a result of any Deferred Payments shall
be treated as a reduction to the Aggregate Merger Consideration and shall be
deducted from any applicable Deferred Payment.

(ii) _Adjustments to Conversion Ratios_. The Conversion Ratios shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change (each a "
_Recapitalization_ ") with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) _Adjustments for Transaction Payments_. Any Transaction Payments
incurred or accrued by the Company or required or agreed to be paid by
the Company pursuant to arrangements entered into by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, all of which are disclosed on Section 1.8(c)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be deducted from the Closing Cash Merger
Consideration, and, at the Closing, Parent shall deliver the amount of the
Transaction Payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Company at least (1) day prior to the Closing Date.

(d) _Deferred Payments_.

(i)  _Calculation_. For purposes of the following, the " _First Measurement
Period_ ") shall mean the calendar twelve month period beginning on the first
day of the first calendar month immediately following the Closing and ending
on the last day of the immediately  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 5  preceding calendar month one year thereafter, and the " _Second Measurement
Period_ " shall mean the one year period beginning on the first day after the
end of the First Measurement Period and ending on the last day of the
immediately preceding calendar month one year thereafter (collectively, with
the First Measurement Period, the " _Measurement Periods_ ", and each a "
_Measurement Period"_ ). For example, if the Closing shall occur on May 15,
2006, the First Measurement Period shall begin on June 1, 2006 and end on May
31, 2007 and the Second Measurement Period shall begin on June 1, 2007 and
end on May 31, 2008. The First Year Deferred Payment shall equal one (1) times
the amount by which the Company Revenue during the First Measurement Period
(the " _First Year Revenue Amount_ ") exceeds the Company Revenue for the
calendar twelve month period immediately preceding First Measurement Period
(such period to be referred to as the " _Base Period_ " and such amount to be
referred to as the " _Base Revenue Amount_ "). The Second Year Deferred
Payment shall equal one (1) times the amount by which the Company Revenue
during the Second Measurement Period exceeds the greater of (A) the Base
Revenue Amount or (B) the First Year Revenue Amount.

(ii) _Company Revenue_. The " _Company Revenue_ " during the Base Period or
any Measurement Period shall equal the consolidated revenue recognized by the
Company or the Parent during the Base Period or by the Parent during any
Measurement Period through the sale, license or leasing of any Company
Products or Company Services as determined in accordance with US GAAP used by
the Company in the preparation of its financial statements, in the case of the
Base Period, and in accordance with US GAAP used by the Parent in the
preparation of its financial statements, in the case of any Measurement
Period. Subject to the foregoing:

(A) The Company Revenue for the Base Period or any portion thereof, shall be
equal to the Company Revenue reported by the Company for such period pursuant
to the Financial Statements of the Company delivered by the Company to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement for such period or portion thereof; 

(B) Subject to Section 1.8(d)(ii)(C) below, there shall be excluded from the
calculation of Company Revenue of any revenue recognized on the sale, license
or lease of a Company Product (other than a disposable component of a Company
Product) by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in a transaction that includes
the sale, lease or license by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any other
capital equipment as a part of the same transaction, unless such Company
Product is separately priced or invoiced, or the price of such capital
equipment exceeds the price set forth on Section 1.8(d)(ii)(B) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Scheduled ASP_ "), in which case the purchase
price so allocated to, or the excess over the Schedule ASP (" _ASP Excess_ ")
of, such Company Product shall be included in Company Revenue; and

(C) Commencing with the First Measurement Date, the calculation of Company
Revenue for each of the first one hundred (100) Promotional Products, in the

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 8 (viii) _Dispute Resolution_. Within forty-five (45) days after the completion
of the Base Period and each Measurement Period, Parent shall provide the
Stockholder Representative a statement (a " _Revenue Statement_ ") certified
by ParentÂ’s chief financial officer, setting forth in reasonable detail
the calculation of the Company Revenues during the applicable Base Period and
applicable Measurement Periods and the amount of the Deferred Payment payable
with respect thereto. The Stockholder Representative shall, upon reasonable
request and notice, be granted access to, and shall have the right to employ
an auditor to review the books and records of Parent as reasonably necessary
in connection the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s review of the calculation of
Company Revenues; provided, that such review must be completed within forty-
five (45) days after the delivery by Parent to the Stockholder Representative
of the Revenue Statement. The review by the Stockholder Representative and any
auditor engaged by it shall be subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement in customary form. The fees and disbursements, if any, of the
Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s auditors incurred in connection with the review
of the calculation of the Company Revenues shall be paid out of the Expenses
Escrow Account. Any fees and disbursements in excess of the Expenses Reserve
shall be paid, at the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s election, from any
remaining unpaid Deferred Payment or the Escrow Fund at the time of

Security Holders. If, after completion of such review, the Stockholder
Representative disagrees as to the amount of any Company Revenues for the
applicable period, the Stockholder Representative shall provide Parent with
written notice of each disputed item and a reasonable description of the
Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s dispute with such item within fifteen (15) days
after completion of the review. In the event of such a dispute, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall attempt to reconcile in good faith their
differences as to such items within twenty (20) days (the " _Resolution
Period_ ") of ParentÂ’s receipt of such notice, and any resolution by them as
to any disputed items shall be final, binding and conclusive on Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company Stockholders, the Eligible Company
Derivative Security Holders and the Stockholder Representative. If Parent and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to reach a resolution with such
effect within the Resolution Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall each submit to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Earnout Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration any and all matters that remain
in dispute in the form of a reasonably detailed written statement. The Earnout
Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder Representative in
writing. The determination of such dispute by the Earnout Accounting Firm
shall be final, binding and conclusive on Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company Stockholders, the Eligible Company Derivative Security Holders

Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative. The fees of the Stockholder Representative for the Earnout
Accounting Firm shall be paid out of the Expenses Escrow Account, provided
that any fees and disbursements in excess of the Expenses Reserve shall be
paid, at the Stockholder Representative election, from any remaining
unpaid Deferred Payment or the Escrow Fund at the time of distribution to the
Company Stockholders or Eligible Company Derivative Security Holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent have any liability or
obligation to pay any of the fees or disbursements of the Stockholder
Representative.

 |  | Page 9 (e) _Dissenters_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Company Stockholders who
shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
Aggregate Merger Consideration. In connection with the exercise of an
appraisal right by a Company Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced by the Aggregate Merger
Consideration allocable to the Company Capital Stock held by such Company
Stockholder (it being intended that such reduction shall not reduce the
Aggregate Merger Consideration allocable to any other Company Stockholder).
Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive their
allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.9 (and the
Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be readjusted accordingly to reflect such
rights), of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such
shares. The Company and the Stockholder Representative shall give Parent: (i)
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by Company or the
Stockholder Representative, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Company or the
Stockholder Representative; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Neither the Company nor the Stockholder Representative shall, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(f) _Parent Purchase Rights_. Each Company Stockholder and each Eligible
Company Derivative Security Holder shall also receive together with
each Merger Share issued to him, her or it in the Merger pursuant to this
Article 1 an associated preferred share purchase right (" _Parent Purchase
Right_ ") pursuant to the Rights Agreement. References herein to Merger Shares
shall be deemed to include the associated Parent Purchase Rights.

1.9 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

(a) _Exchange Agent_. The transfer agent for Parent Common Stock, American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or a bank or trust company designated by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, shall act as the exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger. All fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent
shall be borne by the Parent.

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the Aggregate Closing Merger
Consideration  



      |  |

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 10  (including any Merger Shares included in the Aggregate Closing Merger
Consideration), as such consideration may be adjusted pursuant to Sections 1.7
and 1.8, less the Closing Escrowed Merger Consideration together with any
cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.10 and less
$1,500,000 (the " _Expenses Reserve_ "), which shall be deposited by
Parent into an escrow account (the " _Expenses Escrow Account_ ") maintained
by an escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Stockholder Representative and
Parent (the " _Expenses Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to Section 1.13(b) (such
amount referred to as the " _Closing Exchange Fund_ "), to be exchanged for
the issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and the Eligible
Derivative Securities. In addition, unless Parent elects to make the Deferred
Payments directly to Company Stockholders and Eligible Company Derivative
Security Holders (as provided in Section 1.8(d)(vii) hereof), on or before
each of the First Measurement Payment Date and the Second Measurement Payment
Date, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to make the First Year Deferred Payment and the Second Year
Deferred Payment (in each case, less any Deferred Payment Escrow Amount
deposited with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 1.8(a)(ii)), as
the case may be, to be paid with respect to the shares of Company Capital
Stock and Eligible Derivative Securities converted into the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as of the Effective Time (the " _Post-Closing Exchange Fund_ ",
and together with the Closing Exchange Fund, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At any
time following the later or six months after the Effective Date or the
Second Measurement Payment Date (if Parent elects to distribute the Deferred
Payments through the Exchange Agent), Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent any portion of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent by or on behalf of Parent and which
has not been disbursed to holders of Company Capital Stock and the Eligible
Derivative Securities, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
to Parent with respect to such consideration payable upon due surrender of
their certificates for Company Capital Stock or evidence of their Eligible
Derivative Securities. Parent shall be entitled to rely entirely on the
information contained in the Capitalization Certificate and any transmittal
materials delivered hereunder for purposes of satisfying ParentÂ’s obligation
to deliver the Aggregate Closing Merger Consideration.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. No later than fifteen (15) business days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall cause to be
delivered to each holder of record of: (i) a certificate or certificates
which as of such date (the " _Determination Date_ ") evidenced outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock; or (ii) an instrument which as of the
Determination Date evidenced an Eligible Derivative Security (such
certificates and instruments collectively referred to herein as the "
_Instruments_ "), whose securities will be converted into the right to receive
Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, and, if applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.10: (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall state that no shares of Company Capital Stock or
Eligible Derivative Securities subject to the letter of transmittal have been
or will be transferred by the holder thereof from and after the Determination
Date and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Instruments shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Instruments to the Exchange Agent and the effectiveness of the Merger
substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_ (each a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ");
and (B) instructions to effect the surrender of the Instruments in exchange
for their allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. For the
avoidance of doubt, no  



      |  |

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 11  Company Stockholder or Company Derivative Security Holder shall have any
liability (personally or otherwise) for any breach of the representations
and warranties of another Company Stockholder or Company Derivative Security
Holder in such personÂ’s Letter of Transmittal or Derivative Security
Documentation, as applicable, or otherwise. Upon surrender of an Instrument
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate Letter
of Transmittal and, in the case of Eligible Company Derivative Security
Holders, all other Derivative Security Documentation, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required by such instructions, upon effectiveness of the
Merger, a holder of such Instruments shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor his or her allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
and the right to receive an allocation portion of the Deferred Payments as set
forth in _Exhibit C_ and the Instruments so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Instrument that, prior to
the Effective Time, evidenced shares of Company Capital Stock or an Eligible
Derivative Security will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends or other
distributions, to evidence the ownership of the allocable portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Capital Stock
or such Eligible Derivative Security shall have been so converted. In the
event the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Closing Date or is
terminated earlier in accordance with the terms hereof, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Stockholder Representative, the Instruments shall
be returned to the Company Stockholders and Eligible Company Derivative
Security Holders as appropriate.

(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time, declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Instrument with respect to the
Merger Shares evidenced thereby until the holder of record of such Instrument
shall surrender such Instrument pursuant to Section 1.9(c). Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Instrument, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the Instruments evidencing whole Merger Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for Merger Shares is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Instrument surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Instrument so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.9(e), and that
the Person requesting such transfer will have paid to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
for Merger Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Instrument surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.9, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Surviving Corporation, any other
Subsidiary of Parent or any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock or an Eligible Derivative Security for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.



      |  |

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 12 (g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. From and after the
Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative
Securities shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Instruments shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive
the allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and cash in lieu
of fractional shares accordance with Sections 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 hereof.
All rights to receive the allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional Merger Shares issued upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock and Eligible
Derivative Securities in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Capital Stock and Eligible Derivative Securities, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative
Securities which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Instruments are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 1.9.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Instruments
evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative Securities
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent may require,
before paying any Aggregate Merger Consideration with respect thereto, such
affidavits and indemnities and bonds in support thereof, as it may reasonably
require with respect to such loss, theft or destruction.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative
Securities such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Capital Stock or
Eligible Derivative Security, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. 

1.10 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES; MULTIPLE CERTIFICATES

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
certificates nor scrip for any fractional Merger Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock or an Eligible Derivative Security otherwise entitled to
a fraction of a Merger Share pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.8 and 1.9
shall be paid in cash in accordance with this Section 1.10 in an amount
equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Exchange Price. No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends or interest on or, except for the cash
payment referred to in the preceding sentence, other rights in respect of any
such fractional interest. If more than one Instrument shall be surrendered
for the account of the same Company Stockholder or Eligible Company Derivative
Security Holder, the number of whole Merger Shares for which such Instruments
shall be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.10 shall be computed on the basis of
the aggregate number of Merger Shares for which such Instruments are being
exchanged.

for its services except as otherwise set forth in this Section 1.13. Notices
of communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute

Derivative Security Holders. If any Person serving as the Stockholder

Stockholder Representative be required to expend his own funds in serving in
such capacity.

(c) The Stockholder Representative and a Person serving as Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted in such
capacity while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Company Stockholders and the Eligible Company Derivative Security Holders
shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and a
Person serving as Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless against any
loss, liability or expense incurred without bad faith and arising out of or in

advise him with respect to his rights and obligations hereunder and shall be
fully protected by any act taken, suffered, permitted, or omitted in good
faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel or experts.

(d) Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative after the Effective Time in the scope of the Stockholder
RepresentativeÂ’s authority as provided in the first sentence of Section

Each party shall cooperate with the other party with respect to all filings
with Governmental Authorities that are required to be made by the Company to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
assist Parent and the Merger Sub in making all such filings, applications and
notices as may be necessary or desirable in order to obtain the authorization,
approval or consent of any Governmental Authority which may be reasonably
required or which Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby are subject to the HSR Act, the parties hereto shall promptly and
in good faith file or cause to be filed the appropriate notifications with
respect to the Merger and such transactions, respond to any requests for
additional information and documents and provide the necessary information and
make the necessary filings under the HSR Act (" _Antitrust Filings_ "). Each
party shall cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist
the other party in the preparation of its Antitrust Filings and, if requested,
to promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder. Each party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification,
registration and notice, other than confidential or proprietary information
not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
to keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to the status of each
clearance, approval or waiver sought from a Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
material communications between such party and such Governmental Authority.
Each party shall without limitation: (1) promptly notify the other of, and if
in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other of) any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
written or any oral communication with any such Governmental Authority, (3)
not participate in any meeting or have any communication with any such
Governmental Authority unless it has given the other an opportunity to consult
with it in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority
gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate therein, (4)
furnish the other with copies of all filings and communications between it and
any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (5) furnish the other with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such Governmental Authority. Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the other and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors
of their client

or its legal counsel. Neither party shall, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, person or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially increase the
risk of not obtaining the applicable antitrust clearance, approval or waiver
from a Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

4.5 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event of
which the Company has knowledge which would be reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or incorrect in any material respect at any time from the date
hereof to the Effective Time; and (ii) any failure of the Company to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder in any material respect; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the Company, or
the right of Parent and the Merger Sub to rely thereon, or the conditions to
the obligations of Parent, or the remedies available hereunder to Parent. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other
communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such third
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or
event of which Parent or the Merger Sub has knowledge which would be

time from the date hereof to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of Parent
to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect; provided, however, that no
such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of Parent, or
the right of the Company to rely thereon, or the conditions to the obligations
of the Company, or the remedies available hereunder to the Company. Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company of any notice or other communication
from any third Person alleging that the consent of such third Person is or may

action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
which constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal; or (ii) participate in any

      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 49  this Agreement, the Company may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal
which was not solicited by it and which did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 4.6(a), (i) if, and only if, and only for so long as, this
Agreement has not been previously filed by the Parent with the SEC, request
from the person making such a Company Takeover Proposal such information as
may be reasonably necessary for the Board of Directors to inform themselves
as to the material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal for the sole
purpose of determining whether such Company Takeover Proposal is reasonably
likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and subject to the execution
of a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by the Company after
consultation with its outside counsel, the terms of which are no more
favorable to such person than the Confidentiality Agreement), the Company may
provide a copy of this Agreement to the person making the Company Takeover
Proposal; provided, however, that upon receipt of such information requested
from the person making such a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company shall
not be permitted to engage in any further communications with any such person
except to the extent permitted by this Section 4.6; and (ii) if the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of national reputation, that such Company Takeover Proposal
is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and subject to
providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent
pursuant to paragraph (c) below, (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by the Company after
consultation with its outside counsel, the terms of which are no more
favorable to such person than the Confidentiality Agreements) and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Company Takeover
Proposal (the actions in this clause (ii), a " _Company Takeover Response_
").

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.6, neither the Company nor
the Board of Directors shall: (i) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (ii) cause the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.6(a)) (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ") related to any Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the obtaining of the
approval of the Company Stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors, to the
extent that it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable law, may (subject to this and the following sentences) recommend
any Company Superior Proposal, but only at a time that is after the fifth
business day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice advising Parent that
the Board of Directors is prepared to recommend a Company Superior Proposal,
specifying the terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Company Superior Proposal. During this five
business day period, Parent may make, and in such event the Company shall
consider in good faith, a counterproposal to such Company Superior Proposal,
and, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, the Company
shall itself and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on
its behalf with Parent with respect to the terms and conditions of such
counterproposal for a reasonable period of time given the terms and conditions
of such counterproposal and such Company Superior Proposal. In addition, the
Board  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 50  of Directors shall have a period of at least three business days prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting to recommend a Company Superior Proposal and
the Company may postpone the CompanyÂ’s Stockholders Meeting for an additional
time period so as to provide such three business days. In the event the
Company Stockholders Meeting is postponed to comply with the additional time
periods set forth in the preceding sentence, the Outside Closing Date shall
be extended for such additional time period.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.6, the Company shall promptly, but in any event no
more than twenty-four (24) hours, advise Parent orally and in writing of any
request for information (including any request for information in compliance
with Section 4.6(a)), that could reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Takeover Proposal or of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Company Takeover Proposal and the identity of
the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal. The Company will
keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Company
Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.6 shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company required by applicable Law.

4.7 EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Corporation to adopt and/or continue all Employee Benefit Plans of the
Company identified in Section 2.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, Surviving Corporation shall retain the
sole discretion to amend, restate, merge or terminate any such Employee
Benefit Plan at any time after the Closing to the extent permitted by
applicable Law; _further_ provided that if Parent elects to amend, restate,
merge or terminate any or all of such Employee Benefit Plans it shall, at a
minimum, continue to provide employees of Company who become employees of the
Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
benefits which in the aggregate are equivalent to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or a combination of such benefits and those
available under CompanyÂ’s Employee Benefit Plans. Certain bonuses of existing
employees of the Company, which are set forth on Section 4.7 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, shall be dealt with in the manner set forth on Section
4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and, except with respect to any
pension benefit plan or retiree medical plan, calculation of benefits (except
to the extent crediting such service would result in the duplication of
benefits) under each employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent,
or the Surviving Corporation in which a Company Employee participates, Parent
shall grant, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to grant, each such
employee with credit for all service with Company to the extent permitted by
law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make payments to each
employee for any accrued vacation pay that such employee may be entitled to
under the CompanyÂ’s existing vacation pay policy as set forth in Section

Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, Parent shall, to the
extent permitted under the applicable plans and as permitted by law (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliate prior
to the Closing and (ii) provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any

intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any
third Person, including, without limitation, any employee of the Company, or
any collective bargaining unit or employee organization. Without limiting the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall create or imply any
obligation on the part of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide any
continuing employment right to any individual on or after the Effective Time.

4.8 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

Upon reasonable written notice, each party shall permit representatives of the
other to have access (at all reasonable times and in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal business operations of the other party) to all
premises, properties, financial and accounting records, Contracts, other
records and documents, and personnel of or pertaining to such party, all in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements; provided that the
representatives of the Company may have the access to Parent permitted
hereunder only in order to conduct customary due diligence regarding the
completeness of Parent SEC Reports, the subject matter of ParentÂ’s
representations and warranties under Article 3, and the other information set
forth herein as the Company may reasonably request. No investigation or
examination by either party shall diminish, obviate or constitute a waiver of
the enforcement of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other party under this Agreement.

4.9 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; FURTHER ACTION

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be

otherwise to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all
necessary waivers, consents, authorizations and approvals and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be
satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else in this Agreement, nothing in

Subsidiaries or the Company in connection with seeking to obtain or obtaining
any waiver, consent, authorization or approval of any Person associated with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise.

(c) If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
the Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative and the officers and directors
of the Company and the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action.

4.10 PROXY STATEMENT; PARENT STOCKHOLDER MEETING.

(a) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, the closing
stock price of ParentÂ’s Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
reaches a price that could reasonably be expected to result in the number of
Merger Shares to be issued by Parent in the Merger to be equal to a number
that would require ParentÂ’s stockholders to approve this Agreement and the
Merger under applicable Law or rules of the Nasdaq National Market,
Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such requirement. As promptly as
practical after such notification, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders
of Parent in connection with the meeting of ParentÂ’s stockholders to consider
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the " _Parent
Stockholder Meeting_ "). The Company shall promptly provide Parent with
any required information about the Company or the Company Stockholders as may
be reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Parent
will promptly respond to any comments of the SEC and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
practicable after such filing, but no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent without providing the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable
time after both the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Parent will notify
the Company promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials for supplements to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information and will supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent will cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under this Section 4.10 to comply in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law and the rules and

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 53  regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is

the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of Parent, such supplement.

(b) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that (i) the information to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, on
the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of Parent, at the
time of Parent Stockholder Meeting and at the Closing, contain any statement
which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the
Proxy Statement not false or misleading, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for Parent Stockholder Meeting which has become
false or misleading; and (ii) if at any time prior to the Closing any event
relating to the Company or any of its affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company which should be set forth in a supplement
to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Buyer.

information to be supplied by the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, as to which Parent makes no representation) in the Proxy
Statement shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
stockholders of Parent, at the time of Parent Stockholder Meeting and at the
Closing, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of the
circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with

order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or
misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for Parent Stockholder Meeting which has become false or misleading,
and (ii) if at any time prior to the Closing any event relating to Parent or
any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Parent
which should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent shall
promptly inform the Company.

 |  | Page 57  another to have the issuance of the Merger Shares be issued in the Merger
registered with the SEC on Form S-4 or a successor registration form (the "
_S-4 Registration Statement_ ") by filing with the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the decision to utilize the Registration Statement is made,
the S-4 Registration Statement with respect to the Merger Shares. Each
of Parent and the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to any SEC comments on the S-4 Registration Statement. Each of Parent
and the Company will notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the S-4 Registration Statement or for additional information and shall supply
each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the S-4 Registration Statement or the Merger and (ii) all orders of
the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the S-4 Registration Statement. As
promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC, Parent
shall file with the SEC an amendment to the S-4 Registration Statement and
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the S-4 Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable
thereafter. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as
may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the S-4 Registration
Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be
made by Parent without providing the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Parent will cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC under this Section 5.3 to comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of Federal securities laws
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event
occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
S-4 Registration Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly inform the Company of such
occurrence and cooperate in promptly filing with the SEC an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders
of the Company. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating
to the Company or any of its affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the S-4 Registration Statement, so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly inform Parent.

(c) Following the receipt of the Stockholder Questionnaires and such other
information required to be delivered to Parent in accordance with Section
4.12, in good faith consultation with the Company and its counsel, Parent and
its counsel shall make the determination whether to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement either (i) pursuant to Regulation
D or (ii) with the filing an S-4 Registration Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable.

5.4 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and
former directors and officers

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company, or written
agreements with the Company, including but not limited to, those attached to
Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and such additional provisions
set forth on Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms and be guaranteed by Parent for a period of six years from the Effective
Time notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Organizational Documents
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Company Indemnified
Directors and Officers with respect to their acts and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Existing Company D andO Policy_"); provided, however, that the
Parent may substitute for the Company Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies
of comparable coverage.

(c) The performance by Parent of its obligations under this Section 5.4 shall
not limit or prejudice its rights to assert a claim or claims under Article 8
hereof, regardless whether such claim or claims arise out of the same factual
circumstances constituting the claim or claims under this Section 5.4, and no
Company Stockholder shall be excused from his obligations under Article 8
by virtue of the fact that the item constituting ParentÂ’s claim thereunder
might also constitute the basis for a proper claim by such Company Stockholder
under this Section 5.4 in such Company StockholderÂ’s capacity as a former
officer or director of the Company.

(d) This Section 5.4 will survive any termination of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and the current officers and directors of
the Company, and will be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and
performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4 and the Organizational Documents of
the Surviving Corporation.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns,
as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 65  1.8(d)(vi)(B), which is dealt with in subparagraph (B) below, or breach of
Sections 3.10 and 3.11 for which there shall be no indemnification), made

(B) resulting from or arising out of a material breach of any provision

(c) _Limitations and Conditions on Indemnification_

(i) The rights to indemnification under Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) are subject
to the following limitations and conditions:

(A) Neither the Company Stockholders nor the Eligible Company Derivative
Security Holders nor Parent shall have any indemnification liability under
Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b), respectively, unless one or more of Indemnified
Persons gives written notice to the Stockholder Representative (in the case of
an indemnification claim asserted by a Parent Indemnified Person) or Parent
(in the case of an indemnification claim asserted by a Company Indemnified
Person) asserting a claim for Losses, including reasonably detailed facts and
circumstances pertaining thereto, on or before the First Year Deferred Payment
Date, except that claims for intentional fraud may be made on or prior to the
Second Year Deferred Payment Date.

(B) Indemnification for claims under Section 8.2(a)(i)(A) shall be payable
only if and to the extent the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds
$1,000,000 (the " _Company Deductible_ "). The Company Deductible shall not
apply to Losses that may be recovered under Section 8.2(a)(i)(B) or Section
8.2(a)(i)(C).

(C) Except in the case of a claim for the CompanyÂ’s intentional fraud under
Section 8.2(a)(i)(B), (i) the maximum aggregate amount of Losses that may be
recovered under this Article 8 from the Company Stockholders and Eligible
Company Derivative Security Holders shall not exceed the amount of the
Escrowed Merger Consideration (as it may be increased by the Deferred Payment
Escrow Amount) including any earnings thereon then held by the Escrow Agent
(the " _Escrow Fund_ "); (ii) any such Losses shall be satisfied solely and
exclusively from the Escrow Fund by reducing the amounts that would

recourse shall be sought or initiated with respect thereto.

(D) With respect to a claim for the CompanyÂ’s intentional fraud under Section
8.2(a)(i)(B), (i) the amount of such Losses shall be first satisfied solely

otherwise become payable to the Company Stockholders and the Eligible Company
Derivative Security Holders under the Escrow Agreement, (ii) in the
event that the Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy such Losses for claims
brought on or before the First Year Deferred Payment Date, in no event shall
the maximum  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 66  liability of a Company Stockholder or Eligible Company Derivative Security
Holders for any Losses under this Article 8 or otherwise exceed the
Aggregate Merger Consideration actually received by such Person, and (iii)
for claims for Losses brought after the First Year Deferred Payment Date and
on or before the Second Year Deferred Payment Date, in no event shall the
maximum liability of a Company Stockholder or Eligible Company Derivative
Security Holder for any Losses exceed such PersonÂ’s allocable portion of the
Escrow Fund and no other recourse shall be sought or initiated with respect
thereto. To the extent any Parent Indemnified Person recovers any Losses from
any Company Stockholder or Eligible Company Derivative Security Holder for
intentional fraud of the Company, such Company Stockholder or Eligible Company
Derivative Security Holder shall be entitled to contribution from the other
Company Stockholders and Eligible Company Derivative Security Holders.

(E) Indemnification for claims under Section 8.2(b)(i)(A) shall be payable by
Parent only if and to the extent the aggregate amount of all such claims

Deferred Payment. Indemnification for Losses that may be recovered for claims
under Section 8.2(b)(i)(B) shall be payable by Parent up to an amount not to
exceed $40,000,000 less the aggregate amount of any Deferred Payments (which
shall include any Deferred Payment Escrow Amounts) paid. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no claims for indemnification under Section
8.2(b)(i)(B) may be brought until after the end of the Second Measurement
Period.

8.3 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY

(a) Any person who believes he, she or it may be an Indemnified Person will
give notice to the Stockholder Representative (in the case of a Parent
Indemnified Person) or Parent (in the case of a Company Indemnified Person)
of any Third Party Action. The omission to give such notice to the Stockholder
Representative or Parent (as the case may be) will not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of any liability hereunder unless he or it was prejudiced
thereby, nor will it relieve such Indemnifying Person of any liability which
he or it may have other than under Section 8.2.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Action by the Stockholder
Representative or Parent, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right, at his
or its option and at his or its own expense, to participate in and be present
at the defense of such Third Party Action, but not to control the defense,
negotiation or settlement thereof, which control shall remain with the
Indemnified Person, unless the Indemnifying Person makes the election provided
in Section 8.3(c). The Indemnifying Person shall provide the Indemnified
Person reasonable access to his or its records and personnel relating to any
Third Party Claim during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate
with the Indemnified Person in the defense or settlement thereof.

(c) By written notice within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of a
Third Party Action by the Stockholder Representative or Parent,
an Indemnifying Person may elect to assume control of the defense,
negotiation and settlement thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 67  the Indemnified Person; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Person
agrees: (x) to promptly indemnify the Indemnified Person for his or
its reasonable expenses to date; and (y) to hold the Indemnified Person
harmless from and against any and all Losses caused by or arising out of any
settlement of the Third Party Action or any judgment in connection with that
Third Party Action. The Indemnifying Persons shall not in the defense of the
Third Party Action enter into any settlement which does not include as a term
thereof the giving by the third party claimant of an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Person, or consent to entry of any judgment against the
Indemnified Person except with the consent of the Indemnified Person.

(d) Upon assumption of control of the defense of a Third Party Action under
Section 8.3(c) above the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to the
Indemnified Person hereunder for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of the
Third Party Action other than reasonable expenses of investigation, unless:
(i) the Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that (w) representation
of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel
presents a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional
conduct, (x) there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Person and in
the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Indemnified
Party to employ separate counsel, (y) the amount of the Escrowed Merger
Consideration is likely to be insufficient to satisfy any Losses resulting
from such Third Party Action or (z) the Third Party is seeking injunctive
relief that could have a material adverse effect on the business of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation if the plaintiff were to prevail, or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed to prosecute such defense in good faith,
in which case the Indemnified Person may retain counsel of its own to
participate in the defense.

(e) Subject to the limitations contained in this Article 8, including
applicable deductibles and caps set forth herein, and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement to the extent applicable, if the Indemnifying Person does not elect
to control the defense of a Third Party Action under paragraph (c) and the
parties otherwise agree that such Third Party Action is a claim for which
Losses are subject to indemnification herein, the Indemnifying Person shall
promptly reimburse the Indemnified Person for expenses reasonably incurred by
the Indemnified Person in connection with defense of such Third Party Action,
as and when the same shall be incurred by the Indemnified Person.

(f) Any person who has not assumed control of the defense of any Third Party
Action shall have the duty to cooperate fully with the party that
assumed such defense.

8.4 MISCELLANEOUS

(a) If any Loss is recoverable under more than one provision hereof, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assert a claim for such Loss until the
expiration of the longest period of time within which to assert a claim for
Loss under any of the provisions which are applicable.

(b) The gross amount with respect to a claim for indemnification for which an
Indemnifying Person may be liable to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Article 8 shall be reduced by: (x) any insurance proceeds actually recovered
by or on behalf of the Indemnified  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 68  Person on account of the indemnifiable Loss; (y) any recoveries actually
received by the Indemnified Party from third parties pursuant
to indemnification or otherwise with respect thereto (net of cost of
recovery); and (z) any tax benefit to such Person attributable to amounts
indemnified against. A tax benefit will be considered to be recognized by an
Indemnified Party for purposes of this Section 8.4 at the time it reduces the
aggregate tax liability of such Indemnified Party.

(c) Following the Effective Time, the indemnification expressly provided in
this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of
representation or warranty by the Company or Parent under this Agreement, any
breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company in this Agreement or for
any fraud or wrongful act by the Company, except to the extent such
indemnification is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable. For purposes of this Article 8, the term the "Agreement" shall
include any representations or warranties made by or on behalf of a party
hereto (or an officer of such party) in any certificate delivered on or before
the Closing, which shall for all purposes be deemed to be a representation or
warranty under this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that (i)
nothing in this Agreement shall limit any liability of Parent, any Company
Stockholder or any Eligible Company Derivative Security Holder set forth
in the Registration Rights Agreement, which liability is governed and subject
to the provisions contained in such document, or from any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in any Transaction Document to
which it is a party (which, in the case of a Company Stockholder or Eligible

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 83 11.4 JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter
is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto
(i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located
in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction
over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service being
made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 11.3. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 11.3 shall be effective service of process for
any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

11.5 FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

Except as expressly provided herein, no failure or delay on the part of any
party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right
or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

11.6 ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

No party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties (except the Stockholder Representative),
except that Parent may assign any of its rights, but not its obligations,
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company to any
direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided that Parent  



      |  |

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 84  will not be released from any of its obligations hereunder as a result of
such assignment. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply
to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Except as provided in Section
1.13(f) and Section 5.4 hereof, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect
to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

11.7 SEVERABILITY

(a) If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any party or circumstances shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the
remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to such
party or circumstances other than those to which it is so determined to be
invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision
hereof shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(b) The parties agree that the fees and other amounts provided in Section 9.3
are fair and reasonable under the circumstances. If a court of competent
jurisdiction shall nonetheless, by a final, non-appealable judgment, determine
that such amounts exceed the maximum amount permitted by law, then such
amounts shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted by law in
the circumstances, as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction.

11.8 GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement will be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

11.9 COUNTERPARTS

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which

11.10 INTERPRETATION

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (a) each party and its counsel
reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and have
contributed to its revision; (b) the rule of construction to the effect that
any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed
in the interpretation of this Agreement; and (c) the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to all parties hereto and not in
favor of or against any party, regardless of which party was generally
responsible for the preparation of this Agreement.

11.11 ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER

(a) This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement), whether written or oral, between or among the
parties with respect to its subject  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 85  matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this
Agreement) the entire agreement among the parties with respect to its subject
matter. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or
after the Company Stockholders or Parent Stockholders approve this Agreement,
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment
that by Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders or Parent
Stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of the parties, except that the written agreement of the Stockholder
Representative need not be obtained unless the parties seek to amend a Section
of this Agreement which addresses the rights or duties of the Stockholder
Representative.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may: (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; or (iii) subject to the proviso of Section
11.11(a), waive compliance by another party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Except as expressly
provided herein, the failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.
