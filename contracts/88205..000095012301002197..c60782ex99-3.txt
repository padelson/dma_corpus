                  considering the Arrangement Resolution (and for any other
                  proper purpose as may be set out in the notice for such
                  meeting);

         (c)      not adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose for adjournment,
                  postponement or cancellation), or fail to call, the UDI
                  Meeting without SPX's prior written consent except as required
                  by applicable Laws;

         (d)      solicit from the UDI Shareholders proxies in favour of the
                  approval of the Arrangement Resolution (in a commercially
                  reasonable manner) and use all commercially reasonable efforts
                  to take all other action that is necessary or desirable to
                  secure the requisite approval of the Arrangement Resolution by
                  the UDI Shareholders;

         (e)      subject to the terms of this Agreement and obtaining the
                  approvals as are required by the Interim Order, proceed with
                  and diligently pursue the application to the Court for the
                  Final Order;

         (f)      subject to the terms of this Agreement and obtaining the Final
                  Order and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions
                  herein contained in favour of each party, send to the
                  Director, for endorsement and filing by the Director, the
                  Articles of Arrangement and such other documents as may be
                  required in connection therewith under the CBCA to give effect
                  to the Arrangement; and

         (g)      not earlier than receipt of the UDI Shareholders Approval and
                  not later than the Effective Time, send by prepaid mail to
                  each Dissenting Shareholder who has not before that time
                  withdrawn its notice of dissent, to the address shown for such
                  shareholder on the share register for the UDI Shares, a
                  written offer to pay for such shareholder's UDI Shares in an
                  amount considered by the Board of Directors of UDI, with the
                  approval of SPX, to be the fair value thereof, accompanied by
                  a statement showing how the fair



                                       15
<PAGE>   21

                  value was determined or a notice contemplated under
                  Subsection 190(26) of the CBCA to the effect that UDI is
                  unable lawfully to pay Dissenting Shareholders for their UDI
                  Shares.

         SECTION 2.2 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS BY SPX.

(1)      SPX covenants in favour of UDI that SPX shall:

         (a)      subject to Section 2.5(1), as soon as reasonably practicable,
                  convene and hold the SPX Meeting for the purpose of
                  considering the SPX Resolution (and for any other proper
                  purpose as may be set out in the notice for such meeting);

         (b)      not adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose for adjournment,
                  postponement or cancellation), or fail to call, the SPX
                  Meeting without UDI's prior written consent except as required
                  by applicable Laws;

         (c)      solicit from the SPX Shareholders proxies in favour of the
                  approval of the SPX Resolution (in a commercially reasonable
                  manner) and use all commercially reasonable efforts to take
                  all other action that is necessary or desirable to secure the
                  requisite approval of the SPX Resolution by the SPX
                  Shareholders;

         (d)      incorporate and organize SPX Subco No. 1, SPX Subco No. 2,
                  SPX Subco No. 3 and SPX Subco No. 4 and provide for SPX and
                  SPX Subco No. 4 to hold a sufficient number of SPX
                  Transaction Shares to be delivered by SPX or SPX Subco No.
                  4, as the case may be, to holders of UDI Shares under the
                  Arrangement;

         (e)      incorporate and organize MergeCo and cause MergeCo to perform
                  its obligations under the Arrangement; and

         (f)      cause Amalco to perform its obligations under the Arrangement.

(2)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, SPX shall not be
         obligated to convene, solicit proxies for, or hold the SPX Meeting or
         prepare, file or distribute the Circular (other than to assist UDI in
         the preparation of its Circular as provided herein), or take any other
         action to secure SPX Shareholder approval of the SPX Resolution, and
         receipt of such approval shall not be a condition precedent to either
         party's obligation to complete the Transactions, if SPX determines, in
         its sole judgment, that obtaining such approval is not required by Law
         for the completion of the Transactions. SPX shall endeavor to make such
         a determination as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and
         shall promptly advise UDI after making such determination.

         SECTION 2.3 INTERIM ORDER.

(1)      The notice of motion for the application referred to in
         Section 2.1(1)(a) shall request that the Interim Order provide:

         (a)      for the class of Persons to whom notice is to be provided
                  in respect of the Arrangement and the UDI Meeting and
                  for the manner in which such notice is to be provided;

         (b)      that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution
                  shall be 66 2/3% of the votes cast on the Arrangement
                  Resolution by UDI Shareholders present in person or by proxy
                  at the UDI Meeting;

         (c)      that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and
                  conditions of the UDI Governing Documents, including quorum
                  requirements and all other matters, shall apply in respect of
                  the UDI Meeting;

         (d)      for the grant of the Dissent Rights as contemplated in the
                  Plan of Arrangement; and

         (e)      for the notice requirements respecting the presentation of
                  the application to the Court for a Final Order.

         SECTION 2.4 ARTICLES OF ARRANGEMENT.

(1)      The Articles of Arrangement shall, with such other matters as are
         necessary to effect the Arrangement, implement the Plan of Arrangement,
         as a result of which, among other things:

         (a)      each holder of UDI Shares (other than any holder who has
                  properly exercised its Dissent Rights and is entitled at the
                  Effective Time to be paid the fair value of its UDI Shares and
                  other than MergeCo) will be entitled to receive the
                  Transaction Consideration in respect thereof; and

         (b)      each UDI Option will be treated as set forth in
                  Section 2.2(n) of the Plan of Arrangement.

         SECTION 2.5 CIRCULAR.

(1)      As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement, SPX and UDI shall prepare the Circular and the Letter of
         Transmittal in English, and, if required by Law or any Securities
         Authorities, in French, together with any other documents required by
         the Securities Laws, other applicable Laws or the Interim Order in
         connection with the Arrangement, and shall file the foregoing with all
         requisite Securities Authorities, including the SEC. As promptly as



                                       17
<PAGE>   23

         practicable after the date of execution and delivery of this Agreement
         and after obtaining the Interim Order, the parties hereto shall cause
         the Circular and other documentation required in connection with the
         UDI Meeting and the SPX Meeting to be sent to each UDI Shareholder
         (together with a Letter of Transmittal) and to each SPX Shareholder and
         filed as required by the Interim Order and applicable Laws. If a French
         language version of the Circular and the Letter of Transmittal is
         required, UDI shall procure opinions of legal counsel and of the
         auditors of UDI in forms satisfactory to SPX, acting reasonably,
         confirming the accuracy and completeness of the French translation.

(2)      Subject to the fiduciary duties of the respective Boards of Directors
         under applicable Law as advised by counsel, the Circular shall include
         the SPX Board Recommendation and the UDI Board Recommendation.

         SECTION 2.6 SECURITIES COMPLIANCE.

(1)      SPX shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to
         the Effective Time and to the satisfaction of UDI acting reasonably,
         all orders required from the applicable Canadian Securities Authorities
         to permit the issuance and first resale of the SPX Transaction Shares
         and the SPX Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Replacement
         Options, in each case without qualification with or approval of, or the
         filing of any document (including any prospectus or similar document)
         with, or the taking of any proceeding before, or the obtaining of any
         further order, ruling or consent from, any Governmental Authority under
         any Canadian federal, provincial or territorial Laws, including
         Securities Laws, or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
         Governmental Authority administering such Laws, or the fulfilment of
         any other legal requirement in any such jurisdiction (other than, with
         respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by reason
         of a holder being a "control person" of any SPX Party or UDI for
         purposes of Canadian federal, provincial or territorial Securities
         Laws).

(2)      SPX shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
         applicable form) (the "SPX REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), and take such
         actions as necessary to keep the information therein current from time
         to time, in order to register under the 1933 Act those SPX Common
         Shares to be issued from time to time after the Effective Time upon the
         exercise of the Replacement Options and shall use its commercially
         reasonable efforts to cause the SPX Registration Statement to become
         effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration for
         the period that such Replacement Options remain outstanding.

         SECTION 2.7 PREPARATION OF FILINGS.

(1)      SPX and UDI shall co-operate and use their commercially reasonable
         efforts in:



                                       18
<PAGE>   24

         (a)      the preparation and filing of any application for the orders
                  and the preparation of any required registration statements
                  and any other documents reasonably deemed by SPX or UDI to be
                  necessary to discharge their respective obligations under the
                  Securities Laws or otherwise under this Agreement in
                  connection with the Arrangement and the Transactions;

         (b)      the taking of all such actions as may be required under any
                  Securities Law in connection with the issuance of the SPX
                  Transaction Shares and the SPX Common Shares issuable upon the
                  exercise of the Replacement Options; provided, however, that
                  with respect to the United States "blue sky" and Canadian
                  provincial qualifications, neither SPX nor UDI shall be
                  required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or to
                  take any action that would subject it to service of process in
                  any jurisdiction where such entity is not now so subject,
                  except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the
                  offer and sale of the SPX Transaction Shares or such SPX
                  Common Shares, as applicable; and

         (c)      the taking of all such action as may be required under the
                  CBCA in connection with the Transactions and the Plan of
                  Arrangement.

(2)      Each of SPX and UDI shall furnish to the other all such information
         concerning it and its shareholders as may be required (and, in the case
         of its shareholders, available to it) for the effectuation of the
         actions described in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 and the foregoing provisions
         of this Section 2.7 and the obtaining of all Regulatory Approvals, and
         each covenants that no information furnished by it (to its knowledge in
         the case of information concerning its shareholders) in connection with
         such actions or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the
         Arrangement and the Transactions will contain any misrepresentation or
         untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
         required to be stated in any such document or necessary in order to
         make any information so furnished for use in any such document not
         misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it is made.

(2)      SPX and UDI shall each promptly notify the other if at any time before
         the Effective Date it becomes aware that the Circular, an application
         for an order, a registration statement, a filing or other document
         described in Section 2.5, Section 2.6 or the foregoing provisions of
         this Section 2.7 contains any misrepresentation or untrue statement of
         a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
         misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made, or
         that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the Circular or
         such application, registration statement, filing or other document. In
         any such event, SPX and UDI shall co-operate in the preparation of a
         supplement or amendment to the Circular, application, registration
         statement, filing or other document, as required and as the



                                       19
<PAGE>   25

         case may be, and, if required, shall cause the same to be distributed
         to shareholders of SPX or UDI and/or filed with the relevant
         Securities Authorities.

(3)      UDI and SPX shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
         to ensure that the Circular complies with all applicable Laws and,
         without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that the Circular
         does not contain any misrepresentation or untrue statement of a
         material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
         misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made (other
         than with respect to any information relating to and provided by the
         other party hereto or any third party that is not an affiliate of
         either of such parties). Without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, UDI and SPX shall use their respective commercially
         reasonable efforts to ensure that the Circular provides UDI
         Shareholders and SPX Shareholders with information in sufficient detail
         to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be
         placed before them at the UDI Meeting and the SPX Meeting,
         respectively, and each of UDI and SPX shall provide all information
         regarding itself necessary to do so.

(5)      SPX shall ensure that the SPX Registration Statement complies with all
         applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
         that the SPX Registration Statement, including any prospectus and any
         other document incorporated by reference in the SPX Registration
         Statement, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
         omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in
         light of the circumstances in which they are made (other than with
         respect to any information relating to and provided by UDI or any third
         party that is not an affiliate of SPX) and UDI shall provide all
         information regarding itself necessary to do so.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                                    PUBLICITY

         SECTION 3.1 PUBLICITY.

         Unless otherwise agreed between SPX and UDI, SPX and UDI and their
respective affiliates shall not issue any press release or cause any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions unless
such action is required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with a stock exchange, in which case the party making such
release will use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
party before issuance of such release.

                  business consistent with past practices which are not,
                  individually or in the aggregate, material in amount or

                  to lapse, unless simultaneously with such termination,

         (g)      neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries shall take any action
                  that would, or that would reasonably be expected to, result in
                  any of the representations and warranties of UDI set forth in
                  this Agreement becoming untrue in any material respect;

         (h)      UDI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
                  with SPX with respect to the implementation of any Tax
                  strategies designed to minimize any adverse consequences with
                  respect to Taxes to UDI or Amalco relating to the Officer
                  Obligations or any similar arrangements provided that no
                  action shall be required to be taken by UDI if it reasonably
                  determines that any such Tax strategies could adversely affect
                  UDI or the other parties to the Officer Obligations; and

         (i)      UDI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
                  actions, and do or cause to be done all things necessary or
                  advisable (including the preparation of financial statements
                  and obtaining comfort letters and legal opinions) in order to
                  assist SPX in issuing any securities or obtaining any
                  financing.

         SECTION 6.2 TRANSFER OF ASSETS.

         UDI covenants and agrees that it will, if requested to do so in writing
         by SPX at least 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Date, transfer,
         convey and assign, after the Final Order but before the Effective Date,
         such of its Canadian operating assets as may be specified by SPX to one
         or more new wholly-owned subsidiaries of UDI formed under the laws of
         such Canadian jurisdiction as may be specified by SPX, in each case for
         consideration that includes shares of such wholly-owned subsidiary and
         on such other reasonable terms and conditions as may be specified by
         SPX, provided that such transfer may be effected on a tax-deferred
         basis for income tax purposes pursuant to Subsection 85(1) of the ITA
         and on a basis whereby no goods and services tax will be payable
         pursuant to the election under Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act
         (Canada).

                                COVENANTS OF UDI

         SECTION 7.1 NO SOLICITATION.

(1)      UDI shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall not
         continue any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person
         conducted before the date of this Agreement with respect to any
         Acquisition Proposal and, without limitation, shall promptly, following
         the execution of this Agreement, request the return of all confidential
         information provided by UDI to all Persons who have



                                       25
<PAGE>   31

         had such discussions or negotiations or who have entered into
         confidentiality agreements with UDI pertaining to an Acquisition
         Proposal.

(2)      UDI shall immediately notify SPX of any Acquisition Proposal received
         after the date of this Agreement by it or any of its subsidiaries or
         any of their respective directors, officers, employees, financial
         advisors, counsel or other agents or representatives or of any request
         for confidential information relating to UDI in connection with an
         Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records
         of UDI or any of its subsidiaries by any Person or group (other than
         SPX and its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
         employees, financial advisors, counsel or other agents or
         representatives) (a "THIRD PARTY") that is known by UDI, any of its
         subsidiaries or any of the foregoing Persons to be considering making
         an Acquisition Proposal. Any such notice to SPX shall be made orally
         immediately following any such receipt or request, shall be confirmed
         in writing, and shall indicate the details of the Acquisition Proposal
         or request for information or access known to such Persons, including
         the specific terms of, and the identity of the Third Party making, such
         Acquisition Proposal or request. UDI shall keep SPX informed on a
         timely basis of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, of the
         furnishing of access or information to the Third Party, and of any
         negotiations or discussions relating thereto (including any changes or
         adjustments to the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal as a
         result of negotiations or otherwise).

(3)      Neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective
         directors, officers, employees, financial advisors, counsel or other
         agents or representatives shall, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
         initiate, encourage or facilitate any Acquisition Proposal from any
         Third Party; or (ii) provide any confidential information to, or
         participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to any
         Acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party; or (iii) enter into any
         agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
         terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions; provided, however,
         that UDI may, prior to the receipt of the UDI Shareholders Approval,
         subject to compliance with Section 7.1(2), furnish information to, and
         participate in discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party that
         (x) after the date hereof and prior to the date of the UDI Meeting
         delivers a bona fide written proposal for an Acquisition Proposal that
         was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated by UDI,
         directly or indirectly, after the date of this Agreement or otherwise
         resulted from a breach of this Section 7.1, and (y) enters into an
         appropriate confidentiality agreement with UDI (which agreement shall
         be no less favourable to UDI than the Confidentiality Agreement and a
         copy of which will be delivered to SPX promptly after the execution
         thereof), if, but only if, the Board of Directors of UDI determines in
         good faith by a vote of a majority of the total number of directors
         then in office (after consultation with UDI's independent financial
         advisor) that




                                       26
<PAGE>   32

         such proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
         Acquisition Proposal, and (after consultation with and receipt of
         advice from its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
         action would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of UDI's
         Board of Directors under applicable Law.

(4)      If, prior to the receipt of the UDI Shareholders Approval, the Board of
         Directors of UDI determines in good faith (based upon the written
         advice of UDI's independent financial advisor and the advice of its
         outside legal counsel) by a vote of a majority of the total number of
         directors then in office, with respect to any bona fide written
         proposal from a Third Party for an Acquisition Proposal received after
         the date hereof and prior to the date of the UDI Meeting that was not
         solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated by UDI, directly or
         indirectly, after the date of this Agreement or otherwise resulted from
         a breach of this Section 7.1, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
         Superior Acquisition Proposal and is in the best interest of UDI and
         its shareholders and failure to enter into such Acquisition Proposal
         would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
         Directors of UDI under applicable Law, then UDI may terminate this
         Agreement and enter into an acquisition agreement for the Superior
         Acquisition Proposal; provided that, prior to any such termination, and
         in order for such termination to be effective, (i) UDI shall provide
         SPX two Business Days' written notice that it intends to terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(4), identifying the Superior
         Acquisition Proposal and the parties thereto and delivering an accurate
         description of all material terms of the Superior Acquisition Proposal
         to be entered into, and (ii) on the date of termination (provided that
         the advice of the independent financial advisor and outside legal
         counsel referred to above shall continue in effect without revocation,
         revision or modification), UDI shall deliver to SPX (A) a written
         notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
         7.1(4), (B) a wire transfer of immediately available funds in the
         amount of the Termination Fee, (C) a written acknowledgement from UDI
         that the termination of this Agreement and the entry into the Superior
         Acquisition Proposal are a Triggering Event, and (D) a written
         acknowledgement from each other party to the Superior Acquisition
         Proposal that it has read UDI's acknowledgement referred to in clause
         (C) above and will not contest the matters thus acknowledged by UDI,
         including the payment of the Termination Fee.

         SECTION 7.2 INTERIM ORDER AND FINAL ORDER.

(1)      Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, UDI shall carry out the
         terms of the Interim Order and Final Order applicable to it and use its
         commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with all
         requirements which applicable Laws may impose on UDI or its
         subsidiaries with respect to the Transactions.

                                COVENANTS OF SPX

         SECTION 8.1 COVENANTS OF SPX.

         SPX hereby covenants and agrees (and, if applicable, will cause its
subsidiaries):

         (a)      to reserve a sufficient number of SPX Transaction Shares and
                  a sufficient number of SPX Common Shares for issuance upon
                  the exercise of the Replacement Options;

         (b)      to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
                  listing on the NSYE of the SPX Common Shares included in the
                  SPX Transaction Shares and the SPX Common Shares issuable upon
                  the exercise of the Replacement Options;

         (c)      to carry out the terms of the Interim Order and Final Order
                  applicable to it and use its commercially reasonable efforts
                  to comply promptly with all requirements which applicable Laws
                  may impose on SPX or its subsidiaries with respect to the
                  Transactions; and

         (d)      until the Effective Date or the earlier termination of this
                  Agreement in accordance with Article 11, except with the
                  consent of UDI to any deviation therefrom, which shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld, not to:

                  (i)      split, combine or reclassify any of the outstanding
                           SPX Common Shares without making a corresponding
                           adjustment to the Exchange Ratio; or

                  (ii)     declare, set aside or pay any dividends on or make
                           any other distributions on or in respect of the
                           outstanding SPX Common Shares.

         SECTION 8.2 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.

         SPX acknowledges the existence of the Change in Control Payment
Obligations and Retention Payment Obligations listed in Section E.16(k) of the
UDI Disclosure Letter (and which UDI represents and warrants are the only Change
in Control Payment Obligations and Retention Payment Obligations required to be
listed in Section E.16(k) of the UDI Disclosure Letter), and SPX agrees, after
the Effective Time, to cause Amalco or any successor thereto to honour and
comply with the terms of those (but only those) Change in Control Payment
Obligations and Retention Payment Obligations that are so listed.



                                       28
<PAGE>   34

         SECTION 8.3 OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS INSURANCE.

         SPX agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to secure directors
and officers liability insurance coverage for UDI's current and former directors
and officers on a six (6) year "trailing" or "runoff" basis from and after the
Effective Time; provided, however, if a "trailing" policy is not available, then
SPX agrees that for the entire period from the Effective Time until six (6)
years after the Effective Time, SPX will cause Amalco or any successor thereto
to maintain UDI's current directors' and officers' insurance policy or an
equivalent policy; and provided, further, that in no event shall SPX be required
to expend pursuant to this Section 8.3 more than an amount per year equal to
200% of current annual premiums paid by UDI and its subsidiaries for such
insurance. In either case (but subject to the foregoing proviso limiting the
amount required to be expended) such insurance shall be on terms and conditions
no less advantageous to the directors and officers of UDI than those contained
in the policy in effect on the date hereof and shall cover all present and
former directors and officers of UDI for claims made prior to or within six (6)
years after the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 8.3 are intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any rights to indemnification or contribution or cause of
action that any such Persons may have by contract or otherwise.

         SECTION 8.4 INDEMNITIES.

         SPX agrees that from and after the Effective Time it shall cause Amalco
and its subsidiaries to fulfill their respective obligations pursuant to
indemnities provided or available to past and present officers and directors of
UDI and its subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the UDI Governing
Documents, or articles of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational
documents of subsidiaries of UDI, as the case may be, the CBCA or corporate
statutes and equivalent Laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of
subsidiaries of UDI, as the case may be, and any written indemnity agreements
entered into between UDI and its officers and directors (collectively the
"INDEMNITY RIGHTS"). Such obligations shall continue in full force and effect
(and the UDI Governing Documents, articles of incorporation, bylaws and other
organizational documents of subsidiaries of UDI and the written indemnity
agreements shall not be amended or modified to reduce such obligations in any
respect) for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time. In addition, SPX
agrees to indemnify the directors of UDI for any liability they may incur as a
result of the performance of their obligations under Section 2.1(1)(g) to the
extent such liability is not covered by any directors and officers liability
insurance policy or under any of the Indemnity Rights. The provisions of this
Section 8.4 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights to indemnification or
contribution or cause of action that any such Persons may have by contract or
otherwise. Nothing herein shall limit the right of SPX to cause UDI or any of

                                       29

its subsidiaries to be amalgamated or merged into or otherwise combined with any
other entity.

         SECTION 8.5 COMPENSATION; BENEFIT PLANS.

         SPX agrees to cause Amalco or any successor thereto to maintain, for a
period of at least one year from the Effective Date, salaries and bonus award
opportunities or other incentive compensation opportunities (other than stock
options, restricted stock awards or any other equity-based awards or plans),
profit sharing or deferred compensation at levels which for each active employee
of UDI or any of its subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the "AFFECTED
EMPLOYEES"), including members of management of UDI or any of its subsidiaries,
are comparable in the aggregate (after taking into account benefits that may be
provided to such employee under any employee benefit plan of SPX) either (i) to
those currently applicable to such Affected Employee or (ii) to those provided
to similarly situated employees of SPX from time to time (other than benefits
provided under the SPX Individual Account Retirement Plan). SPX further agrees
to cause Amalco and any successor to Amalco to maintain, for a period of at
least one year from the Effective Date, all UDI Benefit Plans which are employee
welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA currently
available to Affected Employees or to make available alternative employee
welfare benefit plans which take into account, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting thereunder, the past service of Affected Employees to the same extent
such service is credited under comparable UDI Benefit Plans, so as to provide an
Affected Employee employee welfare benefits which are comparable in the
aggregate either (i) to those employee welfare benefits currently provided under
such UDI Benefit Plans to such Affected Employee or (ii) to those employee
welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of SPX from time to
time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to the
employee welfare benefits provided by SPX, (i) Affected Employees shall be
credited as at the Effective Time under the employee welfare benefit plans of
SPX for service with UDI to the extent such service was credited under the UDI
Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying waiting periods related to eligibility
to participate and (ii) SPX shall waive any pre-existing conditions exclusion
for any Affected Employee to the extent such exclusion was not applicable to
such Affected Employee under the UDI Benefit Plans. To the extent Affected
Employees commence participation in employee welfare benefit plans of SPX other
than on the first day of a plan year, such Affected Employees shall be credited
under the employee welfare benefit plans of SPX for amounts expended by such
Affected Employee for such plan year under UDI's employee welfare benefit plans
in satisfaction of co-pay, deductible and other stop-loss provisions of UDI's
employee welfare benefit plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
prevent the termination of employment of any employee or any amendment or
termination of any UDI Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by the terms and
conditions thereof as in effect on the date hereof.

                  Effect on SPX, and UDI shall have received a certificate of
                  SPX addressed to UDI and dated the Effective Date, signed on

                  SPX Transaction Shares and the SPX Common Shares issuable upon
                  the exercise of the Replacement Options.

(2)      UDI may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above conditions
         precedent as a basis for non-compliance by UDI with its obligations
         under this Agreement if the condition precedent would have been
         satisfied but for a material default by UDI in complying with its
         obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 10.4 SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS.

         The conditions precedent set out in Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 shall

         (f)      by either SPX or UDI, if (i) any Law shall have been enacted,
                  entered or promulgated prohibiting the consummation of the
                  Transactions on substantially the terms contemplated hereby or
                  otherwise making the Transactions illegal; or (ii) any order,

                  terms contemplated hereby, and such order, decree, ruling or
                  injunction shall have become final and non-appealable;
                  provided, that the party seeking to terminate the Agreement
                  pursuant to this Section 11.1(f) shall have used its
                  commercially reasonable efforts to remove such order, decree,

                  right to terminate under this Section 11.1(g) shall not be
                  available to any party whose failure to perform any covenant
                  or obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
                  resulted in, the failure of the Effective Date to occur on or
                  before the Outside Date; or

         (h)      by UDI or SPX if at the UDI Meeting (including any adjournment
                  or postponement thereof) the requisite vote of the UDI

                  have been obtained; or

         (i)      by UDI or SPX if at the SPX Meeting (including any adjournment
                  or postponement thereof) the requisite vote of the SPX
                  Shareholders to approve the SPX Resolution shall not have been
                  obtained; provided, however, that this Section 11.1(i) shall
                  have no applicability if, as set forth in Section 2(2), SPX
                  Shareholder approval of the SPX Resolution is not required to
                  be obtained; or

         (j)      by UDI or SPX (provided that the terminating party is not then
                  in breach, in any material respect, of any covenant,
                  representation or warranty or other agreement contained herein
                  of such terminating party) if there shall have occurred an
                  event, occurrence or development, alone or taken together with
                  all other existing facts, that, individually or in the
                  aggregate, has a Material Adverse Effect on SPX or UDI, as
                  applicable.

         SECTION 11.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

(1)      In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
         Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith have no further force or
         effect and there shall be no obligation on the part of SPX or UDI
         hereunder, except as set forth in Sections 3.1, 9.5(2) and 12.4 and
         this Section 11.2, which provisions shall survive



                                       38

         party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

(2)               (a) Upon the happening of a Triggering Event, UDI shall pay to
                      SPX (or to any subsidiary of SPX designated in writing by

                      FEE"). "TRIGGERING EVENT" means any one of the following:

                                    (i)     a termination of this Agreement by

                                    (ii)    a termination of this Agreement
         by UDI or SPX  pursuant to Section  11.1(h) or by UDI pursuant to
         Section 11.1(g) or by SPX pursuant to Section 11.1(b) (but only if the
         breach of covenant, representation, warranty or agreement that gives
         rise to such termination is willful), if (A) any Acquisition Proposal
         is received by UDI or is publicly proposed or announced on or after
         the date hereof and during the term of this Agreement and (B) any
         Business Combination is entered into, agreed to or consummated within
         12 months of such termination of this Agreement;

                                    (iii)   a termination of this Agreement by
         UDI pursuant to Section 11.1(j), if (A) any Acquisition Proposal is
         received by UDI or is publicly proposed or announced on or after the
         date hereof and during the term of this Agreement and (B) any Business
         Combination is entered into, agreed to or consummated within 12 months
         of such termination of this Agreement;

                                    (iv)    a termination of this Agreement by
         UDI pursuant to Section 11.1(c); or

                                    (v)     a termination of this Agreement by
         UDI or SPX pursuant to Section 11.1(h) or by UDI pursuant to Section
         11.1(g) or by SPX pursuant to Section 11.1(b) (but only if the breach
         of covenant, representation, warranty or agreement that gives rise to
         such termination is willful) if any Business Combination is entered
         into, agreed to or consummated within 3 months of such termination of
         this Agreement.

Payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (1) on the second Business Day after such termination in the
case of clause (i) of the definition of Triggering Event, (2) on or prior to the
date of such termination, in the case of clause (iv) of the definition of
Triggering Event, or (3) on the earlier of the date a Contract is entered into
with respect to a Business Combination or a Business Combination is consummated,
in the case of clause (ii), (iii) or (v) of the definition of Triggering Event.
In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable under this Agreement.

                           (b)      The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 11.2(2) and Sections 11.2(3) and 11.2(4) are an
integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, they
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails to pay
promptly any amounts payable by it pursuant to this Section 11.2(2) or Section
11.2(3) or 11.2(4), then the party owing such amounts shall pay to the party
owed such amounts the latter party's costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) in connection with any litigation brought by the latter party to obtain
payment of such amounts, together with interest on such amounts at the prime or
base rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank from the date such amounts were due under
this Agreement until the date of payment.

                           (c)      "BUSINESS COMBINATION" shall mean:

                                    (i)     any amalgamation, plan of
         arrangement, merger, consolidation, business combination or other
         similar transaction or series of transaction as a result of which the
         UDI Shareholders would hold less than 66.67% of the voting securities
         of UDI or the continuing entity resulting from the amalgamation or
         plan of arrangement outstanding following that transaction;

                                    (ii)    the acquisition of 33.33% or more of
         the outstanding UDI Shares; or

                                    (iii)   the acquisition of 50% or more (on a
         book value basis or fair market value basis) of the assets of UDI and
         its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(3)      In the event that SPX Shareholder approval of the SPX Resolution is
         required by Law to be obtained and at the SPX Meeting (including any
         adjournment or postponement thereof) the requisite vote of the SPX
         Shareholders to approve the SPX Resolution shall not have been
         obtained, then SPX shall pay to UDI (or to any subsidiary of UDI
         designated in writing by UDI to SPX) all of the fees and other
         out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by UDI in respect of the
         Transactions (including the fees of its financial and legal advisors),
         up to a maximum payment of $8 million. Payment of such expenses by SPX
         shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the
         third Business Day after the date that the requisite vote of the SPX
         Shareholders to approve the SPX Resolution shall not have been
         obtained.

(4)      In the event that at the UDI Meeting (including any adjournment or
         postponement thereof) the requisite vote of the UDI Shareholders to
         approve the Arrangement Resolution shall not have been obtained, then
         UDI shall pay to SPX (or to any subsidiary of SPX designated in writing
         by SPX to UDI) all of the fees and other out-of-pocket expenses
         reasonably incurred by SPX in respect of the Transactions (including
         the fees of its financial and legal advisors and lenders), up to a



                                       40
<PAGE>   46

         maximum payment of $8 million. Payment of such expenses by UDI shall be
         made by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the third
         Business Day after the date that the requisite vote of the UDI
         Shareholders to approve the Arrangement Resolution shall not have been
         obtained. The amount of any Termination Fee payable under this Section
         11.2 shall be reduced by the amount previously paid by UDI to SPX
         pursuant to this paragraph (4).

         SECTION 11.3 AMENDMENT.

         SECTION 11.4 WAIVER.

         Except as otherwise provided herein, SPX, on the one hand, and UDI, on

other's agreement or the fulfilment of any conditions to its own obligations
contained herein; or (iii) waive inaccuracies in any of the other's
representations or warranties contained herein or in any document delivered by

shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
appropriate officer on behalf of such party.

         SECTION 12.2 MISCELLANEOUS.

         This Agreement, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, and the
agreements expressly provided for herein collectively constitute the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. The parties hereto shall be entitled to
rely upon delivery of an executed facsimile copy of the Agreement, and such
facsimile copy shall be legally effective to create a valid and binding
agreement among the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the Province of
Ontario having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

         SECTION 12.3 ASSIGNMENT.

         Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties; provided, however, that any of the SPX Parties may assign any or
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Transactions to
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of SPX; provided, further,
however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assignor from any of its
obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 12.4 EXPENSES.

(1)      Except as provided in Section 11.2, the parties agree that all
         out-of-pocket expenses of the parties relating to the Arrangement and
         the Transactions, including legal fees, accounting fees, financial
         advisory fees, regulatory filing fees, stock exchange fees, all
         disbursements of advisors and printing and mailing costs ("TRANSACTION
         EXPENSES"), shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

(2)      UDI represents and warrants to SPX that, (i) except for any amounts
         owing by UDI pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of written
         and executed agreements existing as at the date hereof, which
         agreements are disclosed in

         investment banker is or will be entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
         other fee or commission from UDI or any subsidiary of UDI in
         connection with the Transactions and (ii) UDI's other Transaction
         Expenses will not exceed the respective amounts set forth in Section
         12.4 of UDI's Disclosure Letter. Copies of each of the agreements
         referred to in clause (i) of this Section 12.4(2) have been delivered
         to SPX; such agreements contain a complete description of how to
         calculate the payments owing thereunder.

         SECTION 12.5 SEVERABILITY.

         Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law.
Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 12.6 COUNTERPART EXECUTION.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and each
such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute one agreement.

         SECTION 12.7 PARTIES IN INTEREST.

         Except for Sections 8.3 and 8.4 which shall inure to the benefit of the
Persons identified therein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

                           the product of the Exchange Ratio and the number of

                           holder shall be removed from the register of holders

                           product of the number of UDI Common Shares

                           the Amalgamation and the Exchange Ratio, rounded

                           MergeCo Common Share shall be exchanged for one fully
                           paid and non-assessable Amalco Common Share (and no
                           further consideration) and the name of any holder of
                           MergeCo Common Shares shall be removed from the

         (n)      UDI OPTIONS. Subject to applicable laws and regulatory
                  requirements, each UDI Option that is unexercised and
                  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
                  be exchanged for an option ("REPLACEMENT OPTION") to
                  purchase SPX Common Shares. Each Replacement Option shall
                  continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
                  conditions set forth in the relevant UDI Stock Option Plan
                  and the applicable stock option agreement as they exist
                  immediately prior to the Effective Time (and any document
                  or agreement previously evidencing an UDI Option shall
                  thereafter evidence such Replacement Option), except that
                  (i) such Replacement Option shall be exercisable for that
                  number of whole SPX Common Shares as is equal to the
                  product obtained by multiplying the number of UDI Common
                  Shares that were issuable upon the exercise of such UDI
                  Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
                  Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
                  SPX Common Shares, (ii) the exercise price per share for
                  the SPX Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such
                  Replacement Option shall be equal to the quotient
                  determined by dividing the exercise price per UDI Common
                  Share at which such UDI Option is exercisable immediately
                  prior to the Effective Time (adjusted, where necessary, for
                  the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate effective as
                  of the close of business on the Effective Date) by the

                  (iii) such Replacement Option shall vest fully immediately
                  following the Effective Time.

         SECTION 2.3 ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS.

         If, between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding SPX Common Shares shall have been changed into or
exchanged for a different number of shares or kind of shares and/or other
securities and/or property of SPX or another corporation or entity by reason of
any reclassification, split-up, stock dividend or stock combination or any
arrangement, amalgamation or similar statutory procedure (an "ADJUSTMENT
EVENT"), then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted so that each
holder of UDI Shares (other than a Dissenting Shareholder) shall be entitled to
receive at the Effective Time, in lieu of the consideration in SPX Common Shares
and provided for in Section 2.2 hereof, such number and kind of shares and/or
other securities and/or property as such holder would have received if the
record date and payment date for such Adjustment Event had been immediately
after the Effective Time. The consideration payable on the redemption of the
Amalco Special Share pursuant to Section 2.2(l) shall be similarly appropriately
adjusted.

         If the record date for such Adjustment Event shall be prior to the
Effective Time but the payment date therefor shall be subsequent to the
Effective Time, SPX shall take such action as shall be required so that on such
payment date any former holder of UDI



                                      B-11
<PAGE>   63

Shares who shall have received or become entitled to receive SPX Common Shares
pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled to receive such number or kind of
shares and/or other securities and/or property as such holder would have
received as a result of such event if the record date therefor had been
immediately after the Effective Time.

RIGHTS") with respect to such shares pursuant to and in the manner set forth in
Section 190 of the CBCA (subject to the provisions hereof), the Interim Order
and this Section 3.1 (the "DISSENT PROCEDURES") in connection with the
Arrangement; provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 190(5)
of the CBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in
Subsection 190(5) of the CBCA ("NOTICE OF Dissent") must be received by UDI
prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the
date of the UDI Meeting. Holders of UDI Common Shares who seek to exercise such
Dissent Rights and who:

         (a)      are entitled to be paid fair value for their UDI Common Shares
                  shall be deemed to have transferred such UDI Common Shares to
                  UDI at the Effective Time and such UDI Common Shares shall be
                  cancelled and cease to be outstanding at the Effective Time,
                  all as provided in Section 2.2(a); or

         (b)      for any reason prior to the Effective Time do not properly
                  fulfill each of the Dissent Procedures required to be
                  completed by a Dissenting Shareholder or, subsequent to giving
                  Notice of Dissent and prior to the Effective Time, act
                  inconsistently with such dissent, shall be deemed to have
                  participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a
                  non-dissenting holder of UDI Common Shares that is not a
                  holder of Directly Exchanged UDI Common Shares and shall be
                  entitled to receive SPX Common Shares and a fractional
                  interest in the Amalco Special Share which shall be redeemed
                  for a fractional interest in one (1) SPX Common Share, all in
                  accordance with Section 2.2;

and in no case shall SPX, SPX Subco No. 1, SPX Subco No. 2, SPX Subco No. 3, SPX
Subco No. 4, MergeCo, UDI, Amalco or any other Person be required to recognize
such holders, or any other Person, as holders of UDI Common Shares after the
Effective Time and the names of such holders of UDI Common Shares shall be
deleted from the share register of UDI in respect of the UDI Common Shares as of
the Effective Time.

than Directly Exchanged UDI Common Shares and UDI Common Shares cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) together with a properly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and such other documents and instruments as would have
been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly represented by such
certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of UDI and such additional documents
and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and
the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that
number of whole SPX Common Shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2 from SPX Subco No. 4 (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in lieu
of fractional SPX Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.4, less any amounts
withheld pursuant to Section 4.5), and the certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of UDI Common
Shares that is not registered in the share register for UDI Common Shares, a
certificate representing the proper number of SPX Common Shares may be issued to
the transferee if the certificate representing such UDI Common Shares is
presented to the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and payment of all transfer taxes, if any. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented UDI Common Shares (other
than Directly Exchanged UDI Common Shares and UDI Common Shares cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) shall be deemed at all times after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the
certificate representing SPX Common Shares as contemplated by this Section 4.1,
(ii) a cash payment in lieu of fractional SPX Common Shares as contemplated by
Section 4.4, and (iii) any dividends or distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to SPX Common Shares
as contemplated by Section 4.2. At or promptly after the Effective Time, SPX
shall deposit with the Depositary, as custodian for the benefit of holders of
Directly Exchanged UDI Common Shares, certificates representing that whole
number of SPX Common Shares issued by SPX to such holders pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to
the exchange of certificates representing


                                      B-13
<PAGE>   65

Directly Exchanged UDI Common Shares for certificates representing SPX Common
Shares.

         SECTION 4.2 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNSURRENDERED CERTIFICATES.

         No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to SPX Common Shares, as applicable, with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding UDI Common Shares, unless and until the holder of record of such
certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with Section 4.1.
Subject to applicable law, at the time of such surrender of any such
certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of record of a certificate
formerly representing UDI Common Shares, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such SPX Common Share, and (ii) on the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such SPX Common Share, as the
case may be.

         SECTION 4.3 LOST CERTIFICATES.

         In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding UDI Common Shares shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, one or more
certificates representing one or more SPX Common Shares (and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and any entitlements of the holder thereof to
cash in lieu of fractional SPX Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.4)
deliverable in accordance with the Plan of Arrangement and such holder's Letter
of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such certificates representing SPX
Common Shares are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to SPX in such sum as SPX may direct or
otherwise indemnify SPX in a manner satisfactory to SPX, against any claim that
may be made against SPX, with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

         SECTION 4.4 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.

         No certificates or scrip representing fractional SPX Common Shares
shall be issued or delivered upon the surrender for exchange of certificates
pursuant to Section 4.1 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the
capital structure of SPX shall relate to any such fractional security and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights
as a security holder of UDI or SPX. In lieu of any such fractional securities,
each Person otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in an SPX



                                      B-14
<PAGE>   66

Common Share shall receive a cash payment from the Depositary equal to the
product of (i) such fractional interest multiplied by (ii) the Current Market
Price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. SPX and SPX Subco No. 4 shall from
time to time as necessary provide the Depositary with funds sufficient to
satisfy these obligations. On the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, the
aggregate number of SPX Common Shares for which no certificates were issued as a
result of the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.4 shall be deemed to have
been surrendered by the Depositary for no consideration to SPX or SPX Subco No.
4 as appropriate.

         SECTION 4.5 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.

         SPX, SPX Subco No. 4, Amalco and the Depositary shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of UDI Common Shares or SPX Common Shares such amounts as SPX, SPX Subco
No. 4, Amalco or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to such payment under the ITA, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in
each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the
holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required to be
deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of
the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, SPX, SPX Subco No. 4, Amalco
and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such
portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to SPX,
SPX Subco No. 4, Amalco or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and SPX, SPX Subco No. 4,
Amalco or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit to the holder
any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

         SECTION 4.6 EXTINCTION OF RIGHTS.

         Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding UDI Common Shares that is not deposited with all other
instruments required by Section 4.1 on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or
nature as a shareholder of SPX. On such date, the SPX Common Shares to which the
former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was
ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no
consideration to SPX Subco No. 4, together with all entitlements to dividends,
distributions and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. None
of SPX, SPX Subco No. 4, Amalco or the Depositary shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any SPX Common Shares (or dividends, distributions and interest in
respect thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                                  SCHEDULE "D"

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SPX

         SPX hereby represents and warrants to and in favour of UDI as follows,
except as otherwise disclosed in the corresponding Sections or Subsections of
the SPX Disclosure Letter:

SECTION D.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.

         SPX is a corporation duly incorporated and organized and validly
existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each
of SPX's subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated and organized and
validly existing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted. SPX and each of its subsidiaries is duly registered to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties, owned or leased, or the nature of its activities make such
registration necessary, except where the failure to be so registered or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on SPX. The copies of SPX's certificate of incorporation and bylaws filed
or incorporated by reference in SPX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1999 are complete and correct, have not been amended and are
in full force and effect.

SECTION D.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT.

         SPX has the requisite corporate authority to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
SPX's Board of Directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of SPX
are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Transactions (except for
possibly obtaining shareholder approval in respect of the SPX Resolution and the
approval of the issuance of the SPX Common Shares in the Plan of Arrangement).
The Board of Directors of SPX, at a meeting duly called and held at which a
quorum was present throughout, has unanimously determined (a) that the
Transactions are in the best interest of SPX and its shareholders and (b) to
recommend to SPX's shareholders that they vote their SPX Common Shares in favor
of the Transactions (the "SPX BOARD RECOMMENDATION"), and the SPX Board
Recommendation has not been revoked or modified. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by SPX and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of SPX enforceable against SPX in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general
principles of equity.



                                      D-1
<PAGE>   70

SECTION D.3 NO VIOLATIONS.

(1)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by SPX, the
         consummation of the Transactions nor compliance by SPX with any of the
         provisions hereof will: (i) violate, conflict with, or result in breach
         of any provision of or the creation of any rights in favour of another
         party under, require any consent, approval or notice under, or
         constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
         or both, would constitute a default) or result in a right of
         termination or acceleration or any other change in any of the rights or
         obligations of any party under, or result in a creation of any lien,
         security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or
         assets of SPX or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of (x) the SPX Governing Documents or the
         comparable governing documents of any of its subsidiaries or (y) any
         note, bond, mortgage, indenture, loan agreement, deed of trust,
         agreement, lien or other Contract, instrument or obligation to which
         SPX or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of them, or
         any of their respective properties or assets, may be subject or by
         which SPX or any of its subsidiaries is bound; or (ii) subject to
         compliance with the statutes and regulations referred to in Section
         D.3(2) below, violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction,
         determination, award, decree or Law applicable to SPX or any of its
         subsidiaries (except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii)
         above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or
         terminations which would not, or any consents, approvals or notices
         which, if not given or received, would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX).

(2)      No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration or
         filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained in
         connection with the execution and delivery by SPX of this Agreement or
         the consummation by SPX of the Transactions other than (A) consents,
         approvals, orders, authorizations, declarations or filings of or with
         any Governmental Authority that are required to be disclosed pursuant
         to Section E.3(2), as to which no representation or warranty is made,
         and (B) any other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
         declarations, or filings of or with a Governmental Authority which if
         not obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.4 CAPITALIZATION.

         The authorized share capital of SPX consists of 100 million SPX Common
Shares and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, issuable in
series. As of March 8, 2001, 30,447,446 SPX Common Shares were issued and
outstanding and 500,000 shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of
which none were outstanding, and 5,000,000 SPX Common Shares were reserved for
issuance pursuant to the exercise of options granted under the SPX stock option
plans and set



                                      D-2
<PAGE>   71

forth in Section D.4 of the SPX Disclosure Letter. Except for the aforesaid SPX
options, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements or
commitments of any character whatsoever ("SPX SHARE ARRANGEMENTS") requiring the
issuance, grant, sale or transfer by SPX of any shares of SPX (including the SPX
Common Shares) or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any shares of SPX
including the SPX Common Shares) (collectively, with shares of SPX, "SPX
SECURITIES"), nor are there any outstanding stock appreciation rights, phantom
equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments based upon the
book value, income or other attribute of SPX ("SPX PHANTOM RIGHTS"). Since
January 19, 2001, there have been no increases to any of the amounts set forth
above, other than increases in the number of outstanding SPX Common Shares by
reason of issuance of SPX Common Shares upon exercise of any of the outstanding
SPX options set forth above, which issuances have reduced the number of such
outstanding SPX options by a corresponding amount. There are no obligations of
SPX or any subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any SPX
Securities. All outstanding SPX Common Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to, nor
were they issued in violation of, any preemptive rights, and all SPX Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options in accordance with
their respective terms will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and will not be subject to any preemptive rights.

SECTION D.5 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2000, there has not been any event, occurrence or
development, alone or taken together with all other existing facts, that,
individually or in the aggregate, has a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.6 NO UNDISCLOSED MATERIAL LIABILITIES.

         Neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise (and
whether or not the subject of any other representation or warranty hereunder),
except (a) liabilities or obligations reserved against or disclosed in the
audited consolidated financial statements of SPX as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000 contained in SPX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, or disclosed in the footnotes thereto or
otherwise disclosed in such Annual Report on Form 10-K (in each case, in the
amount or of the magnitude so reserved against or disclosed), and (b)
liabilities or obligations which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.7 BROKERAGE FEES.

         SPX has not retained (nor will it retain) any financial advisor,
broker, agent or finder or paid or agreed to pay any financial advisor, broker,
agent or finder on account of this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except
that Chase Securities Inc. has been


                                      D-3
<PAGE>   72

retained as SPX's financial advisor in connection with certain matters,
including the Transactions. SPX has delivered to UDI a true and complete copy of
its agreement with Chase Securities Inc.

SECTION D.8 REQUIRED VOTE.

                  Assuming any approval by SPX Shareholders of the SPX
Resolution is required, then the requisite vote is the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of shares present at the SPX Shareholders Meeting (the
"SPX SHAREHOLDERS APPROVAL") and no other vote of SPX's shareholders is required
under Law, SPX's certificate of incorporation or otherwise in order for SPX to
consummate the Transactions.

SECTION D.9 REPORTS.

(1)      SPX has timely filed with the Securities Authorities all forms,
         reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed
         by it since December 31, 1997 under the Securities Laws (such
         documents, as supplemented or amended since the time of filing, and
         including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated
         by reference therein, the "SPX SECURITIES REPORTS"). SPX has heretofore
         delivered to UDI true and complete copies of the SPX Securities
         Reports. As of their respective dates, the SPX Securities Reports did
         not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
         material fact that is required to be stated therein or that is
         necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, and complied in all material
         respects with all applicable requirements of Law. The audited financial
         statements and unaudited interim financial statements (including any
         related notes or schedules) of SPX and its consolidated subsidiaries
         publicly issued by SPX, or included or incorporated by reference in the
         SPX Securities Reports, were prepared in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting principles in the United States consistently
         applied (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such financial statements
         and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited statements, in the
         related report of SPX's independent accountants; or (ii) in the case of
         unaudited interim financial statements, to the extent they may not
         include footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements), and
         fairly present the consolidated financial position, results of
         operations and changes in financial position of SPX and its
         consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods
         indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim
         financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which,
         individually or in the aggregate, would not be material in amount or
         effect).

(2)      SPX will deliver to UDI as soon as they become available true and
         complete copies of any SPX Securities Report filed by it with
         Securities Authorities subsequent to the date hereof. As of their
         respective dates, such SPX Securities Reports (excluding any
         information therein provided by UDI, as to which SPX makes no
         representation) will not contain any misrepresentation or untrue



                                      D-4
<PAGE>   73

         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
         to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
         light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading
         and will comply in all material respects with all applicable
         requirements of Law. The financial statements of SPX and its
         consolidated subsidiaries (including any related notes or schedules)
         issued thereby or to be included or incorporated by reference in such
         SPX Securities Reports (excluding any information therein provided by
         UDI, as to which SPX makes no representation) will be prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
         States consistently applied (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such
         financial statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited
         statements, in the related report of SPX's independent accountants; or
         (ii) in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to the
         extent they may not include footnotes or may be condensed or summary
         statements) and will present fairly the consolidated financial
         position, results of operations and changes in financial position of
         SPX and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for
         the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited
         interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments
         which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material in
         amount or effect).

SECTION D.10 U.S. REGISTRATION.

         The SPX Common Shares were not issued by a closed-end investment
company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940.

SECTION D.11 SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) All of the capital stock of, or other ownership interest in, each
of SPX's subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by SPX, free and clear of any and
all liens, charges, security interests, adverse claims, encumbrances and demands
of any nature or kind whatsoever. There are no existing SPX Share Arrangements
requiring the issuance, grant, sale or transfer by any SPX subsidiary of any
shares of any SPX subsidiary or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any shares of
any SPX subsidiary (collectively with shares of any SPX subsidiary, "SPX
SUBSIDIARY SECURITIES"), nor are there any outstanding stock appreciation
rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments based upon the book value, income or other attribute of any SPX
subsidiary ("SPX SUBSIDIARY PHANTOM RIGHTS"). There are no obligations of SPX or
any subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any SPX Subsidiary
Securities. None of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of any of SPX's subsidiaries purport to grant rights to
any Person or group other than (1) customary rights with respect to corporate
governance given to all shareholders pro rata in accordance with their holdings
and (2) customary rights of indemnification of directors and officers.



                                      D-5
<PAGE>   74

         (b) A complete listing of SPX's subsidiaries, other than inactive
subsidiaries with less than $1,000,000 in assets or liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) (the "SPX INACTIVE SUBSIDIARIES") is set forth in
Section D.11(b) of the SPX Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in Section
D.11(b) of the SPX Disclosure Letter, neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, business association
or other entity other than the SPX Inactive Subsidiaries.

SECTION D.12 LITIGATION.

         There is no litigation, suit, claim, action, prosecution, proceeding or
governmental investigation pending or, to the knowledge of SPX, threatened
against or relating to SPX or any of its subsidiaries (including, for greater
certainty, with respect to any environmental or employee matters) that (i)
involves a claim against SPX or any of its subsidiaries that (x) could
reasonably be expected to result in damages in excess of $1,000,000 or seeks
damages in excess of $5,000,000, (y) seeks injunctive or other equitable relief
or (z) individually or in the aggregate, would, if successful (and regardless of
amount), have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX; or (ii) in any manner challenges
or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay or limit the performance
of this Agreement by SPX or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
SPX (or any of its subsidiaries) nor any property or asset of SPX (or any of its
subsidiaries) is subject to any Governmental Order which, individually or in the
aggregate, would prevent SPX from performing its material obligations under this
Agreement or has a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.13 ENVIRONMENTAL.

(1)      SPX and its subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with all
         applicable environmental Laws, except for non-compliance that does not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         SPX.

(2)      Since December 31, 1998, neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries has
         ever received any notice of or been prosecuted for material
         non-compliance with any environmental Laws, nor has SPX or any of its
         subsidiaries settled any allegation of non-compliance short of
         prosecution.

(3)      There are no actual or, to the knowledge of SPX, threatened orders,
         warnings or directions relating to environmental matters requiring any
         work, repair or construction or capital expenditures to be made with
         respect to any of SPX's or any of its subsidiaries' properties or
         operations, nor has SPX or any of its subsidiaries received notice of
         any of the same, that, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on SPX.



                                      D-6
<PAGE>   75

(4)      There is not on, in or under any property currently or, to SPX's
         knowledge, previously owned, leased, managed, controlled or operated by
         SPX or any of its subsidiaries any of the following: (1) underground
         storage tanks or surface impoundments, (2) asbestos-containing
         materials, (3) polychlorinated biphenyls, or (4) other "Hazardous
         Substances" (as such term is defined under the Comprehensive
         Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42
         U.S.C. Section 9601, et seq., as amended as of the date hereof) or
         petroleum products, in each case which would reasonably be expected to
         form the basis of liability or other obligation of SPX or any of its
         subsidiaries under any applicable environmental Laws, except for such
         liabilities or obligations which do not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.14 TAX MATTERS.

(1)      SPX and its subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns required to
         be filed by applicable Law with respect to each of SPX and its
         subsidiaries or any of their income, properties or operations, except
         where the failure to file does not, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX. All such Tax Returns are true,
         accurate and complete and accurately set forth all items required to be
         reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable Tax Laws,
         except to the extent that any inaccuracies in filed Tax Returns do not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         SPX. SPX and its subsidiaries have timely paid all Taxes attributable
         to each of SPX and its subsidiaries that were due and payable without
         regard to whether such Taxes have been assessed, except to the extent
         that failure to pay does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on SPX. SPX has made available to UDI complete
         and accurate copies of all United States federal, state, provincial,
         local and foreign income tax and corporate tax returns, and any
         amendments thereto, filed by or on behalf of SPX or any of its
         subsidiaries or any member of a group of corporations including SPX or
         any of its subsidiaries for the taxable years ending 1997, 1998 and
         1999.

(2)      There are no pending or, to the knowledge of SPX, threatened audits,
         examinations, investigations, deficiencies, claims or other proceedings
         relating to Taxes of SPX or any of its subsidiaries. SPX and its
         subsidiaries have made adequate provisions in accordance with United
         States generally accepted accounting principles appropriately and
         consistently applied to each of SPX and its subsidiaries in the
         consolidated financial statements included in the SPX Securities
         Reports referred to in Section D.9(1) for the payment of all Taxes for
         which SPX and its subsidiaries may be liable for the periods covered
         thereby that were not yet due and payable as of the dates thereof,
         regardless of whether the liability for such Taxes is disputed. None of
         SPX or any of its subsidiaries is liable for Taxes in respect of the
         period after the date of such consolidated financial statements other
         than in respect of Taxes arising in the ordinary course of


                                      D-7
<PAGE>   76

         business and Taxes that do not, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

(3)      There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory
         period of limitation applicable to any material Tax Return of SPX or
         any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, any waiver or
         other arrangement providing for an extension of time with respect to
         the filing of any such Tax Return, the payment of any Tax or the
         issuance of an assessment or reassessment. Neither SPX nor any of its
         subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code.
         Neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries (i) has any Tax liability under
         United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or analogous state,
         local, or foreign law provision for the Tax liabilities of any entity
         other than SPX or any of its subsidiaries, or as a transferee or
         successor, except to the extent any such liabilities do not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         SPX, or (ii) is a party to a Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreement or
         any other agreement of a similar nature with any entity other than SPX
         or any of its subsidiaries that remains in effect and under which SPX
         or any such subsidiary could have any material liability for Taxes. No
         claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
         where SPX or any of its subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that SPX
         or any of its subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that
         jurisdiction where such claim, if determined adversely to SPX or such
         subsidiary, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
         Adverse Effect on SPX.

(4)      SPX and each of its subsidiaries has withheld or collected all amounts
         required to be withheld or collected by it on account of Taxes and has
         remitted all such amounts to the appropriate Tax authority when
         required by Law to do so, except where the failure to do so would not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         SPX. With respect to any taxable period ended prior to January 1, 1990,
         all United States federal income Tax Returns of SPX and its
         subsidiaries have been audited by the relevant Taxing Authority or are
         closed by the applicable statue of limitations. SPX and each of its
         subsidiaries is in full compliance with all terms and conditions of any
         Tax exemptions or other Tax-sparing agreement or order of a foreign
         government and the consummation of the Transactions shall not have any
         adverse effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such
         Tax exemptions or other Tax-sparing agreement or order.

SECTION D.15 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

         SPX and each of its subsidiaries each:

                  (a) conducts its businesses in compliance with all Laws
applicable thereto or to its employees or properties;



                                      D-8
<PAGE>   77

                  (b) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and
approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all
Governmental Authorities that are required in order to permit it to conduct its
businesses substantially as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to SPX's
knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and

                  (c) has received, since December 31, 1998, no notification or
communication from any Governmental Authority (i) asserting that it is not in
compliance with any Laws or Governmental Orders, (ii) threatening to revoke any
permit, license, authorization, order or approval, or (iii) failing to approve
any proposed acquisition, or stating the intention not to approve any
acquisition proposed to be effected by it within a certain time period or
indefinitely;

except for instances which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                  (a) True and complete copies of all SPX Benefit Plans and
related documents, and all amendments thereto, have been made available to UDI.

                  (b) SPX has administered each SPX Benefit Plan in all material
respects in accordance with the terms thereof and all applicable Laws and all
contributions, premiums and payments required to be made under the terms of any
SPX Benefit Plan have been made. Each SPX Benefit Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favourable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and SPX is not aware of
any circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified status of
such plan. SPX has made available to UDI reasonably acceptable evidence that
each SPX Canadian Pension Plan and all amendments thereto have been accepted for
registration by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and any provincial
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such SPX Canadian Pension Plan.
Nothing has occurred which would result in the revocation of the registration of
any SPX Canadian Pension Plan under the ITA and any applicable provincial
pension legislation. All amounts paid by SPX under the provisions of the SPX
Canadian Pension Plans will be deductible for income tax purposes.

                  (c) No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by SPX or any of its subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate. No Pension Plan of SPX or any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in
Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived.

                  (d) Each SPX Canadian Pension Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan is not underfunded on either a "going concern" and a "solvency"
basis by more than


                                      D-9
<PAGE>   78

$3,000,000, as determined in accordance with the actuarial assumptions and
methods used in the most recent actuarial report filed with (and accepted for
filing by) the applicable Governmental Authorities in respect of each such SPX
Canadian Pension Plan. There has been no withdrawal by SPX of assets from any
SPX Canadian Pension Plan and no application for approval of a withdrawal of
assets has been made to any Governmental Authority. Any application of surplus
assets in any of the SPX Canadian Pension Plans to offset required employer
contributions to such SPX Canadian Pension Plans has been permitted by Law and
was permitted under the terms of the relevant SPX Canadian Pension Plan and
associated funding agreement.

                  (e) All liabilities for benefits arising out of or relating to
each SPX Benefit Plan established or operated pursuant to the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada (i) have been determined in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plan document, applicable Law and
actuarial assumptions appropriate for such jurisdiction and in a manner that
fairly reflects the total liabilities of the applicable SPX Benefit Plan, and
(ii) have been accurately reserved against or disclosed in the audited
consolidated financial statements of SPX.

                  (f) The execution of this Agreement or performance of the
Transactions will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) (i) constitute an event under any SPX Benefit Plan,
employment, termination or severance Contract, trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current or former employee,
officer or director, or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of SPX to amend or terminate any SPX
Benefit Plan and receive the full amount of any excess assets remaining or
resulting from such amendment or termination, subject to applicable Taxes. The
execution of this Agreement or performance of the Transactions will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) result in
any payment or benefit being made by SPX or any of its affiliates with respect
to any employee of SPX that will be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

                  (g) Neither SPX, any of its subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any benefit plan which
provides life insurance, medical, severance or other employee welfare benefits
to any of its employees upon his retirement or termination of employment, except
as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or any other Law.

                  (h) Neither SPX, any of its subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any withdrawal liability
(within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA) with respect to any
"multi-employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA (a "MULTI-EMPLOYER PLAN"), which liability has not been fully paid as of
the date hereof. As of the Effective Time, SPX, each of its



                                      D-10
<PAGE>   79

subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate will not have completely or partially
withdrawn from any Multi-Employer Plan and will not be subject to any withdrawal
liability as described in Section 4201 of ERISA for withdrawals that have
occurred on or prior to the Effective Date. Neither SPX, any of its subsidiaries
nor any ERISA Affiliate has knowledge that any Multi-Employer Plan fails to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, is insolvent or is in reorganization
within the meaning of Part 3 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

                  (i) SPX and each of its subsidiaries (i) is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment, employment
practices, labor, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours; and
(ii) has withheld all material amounts required by Law or by agreement to be
withheld from the wages, salaries and other payments to its employees.

                  (j) No work stoppage or labor strike against SPX or any of its
subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of SPX, threatened. Neither SPX nor
any of its subsidiaries (i) is involved in or, to the knowledge of SPX,
threatened with any material labor dispute, grievance, or litigation relating to
labor matters, including, without limitation, violation of any federal, state or
local labor, safety or employment laws (domestic or foreign), charges of unfair
labor practices or discrimination complaints; or (ii) has engaged in any
material unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.

SECTION D.17 INSURANCE.

                  Section D.17 of the SPX Disclosure Letter is a true and
complete description of all policies of fire, liability, production, completion
bond, errors and omissions, workmen's compensation and other forms of insurance
owned or held by SPX or any of its subsidiaries currently in effect or in effect
at any time since December 31, 1999 covering the assets, business, operations,
officers, directors or employees of SPX or any of its subsidiaries. All current
insurance policies are in full force and effect, all premiums with respect
thereto covering all periods up to and including the Effective Time have been
paid or will be paid prior to the Effective Time, and no notice of cancellation
or termination has been received with respect to any such policy. Such policies
(i) are sufficient for compliance with all requirements of Law and of all
Contracts to which SPX or any of its subsidiaries is a party, (ii) cover the
respective policy periods and the risks or matters, and provide the coverage
(including any deductibles or retentions), set forth in Section D.17 of the SPX
Disclosure Letter and (iii) will not in any way be affected by, or terminate or
lapse by reason of, the Transactions. During the last three years, neither SPX
nor any of its subsidiaries has been refused any insurance with respect to its
assets or operations, nor has its coverage been limited, by any insurance
carrier to which it has applied for any such insurance or with which it has
carried insurance. Neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
notice of increase in premiums with respect to, or cancellation or non-renewal



                                      D-11
<PAGE>   80

of, any of its insurance policies, and neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries
has made any claim against an insurance policy as to which the insurer is
denying coverage or defending the claim under a reservation of rights.

SECTION D.18 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                  With respect to each item of intellectual property or
proprietary information used in the business of SPX and its subsidiaries ("SPX
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"), SPX and its subsidiaries own or are validly licensed,
or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights, to use the SPX Intellectual
Property and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
alter or impair such ability in any respect, except for instances which do not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX. To
SPX's knowledge, the conduct of the business of SPX and its subsidiaries and the
SPX Intellectual Property do not infringe any rights of any Third Party, and,
neither SPX nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
other third party pertaining to or challenging the right of SPX or any of its
subsidiaries to use any of the SPX Intellectual Property. To SPX's knowledge, no
third party is infringing upon any of the SPX Intellectual Property, except as
do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX.
With respect to each item of SPX Intellectual Property that is an application,
either SPX or the applicable subsidiary is the applicant or has the right to
require the applicant to transfer ownership to SPX or such subsidiary of the
application and of the registration once it issues. All rights of SPX and its
subsidiaries in the SPX Intellectual Property are valid and subsisting and in
full force and effect, except for instances which do not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on SPX. The SPX Intellectual Property
is all the intellectual property that is necessary for conduct of the business
of SPX and its subsidiaries, as is currently conducted.

SECTION D.19 TITLE TO ASSETS.

                  SPX and its subsidiaries own or hold under valid Contracts all
of the assets, tangible or intangible, necessary for the conduct of their
business as currently conducted except where the failure to own or so hold such
assets does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on SPX.

SECTION D.20 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

                  The Board of Directors of SPX has received the opinion of
Chase Securities Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to SPX and such opinion
has not been revoked or modified in any respect. A copy of the written opinion
of Chase Securities Inc. to the foregoing effect will be delivered to UDI as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

SECTION D.21  MATERIAL CONTRACTS.
                  Each note, mortgage, indenture, nongovernmental permit or
license, lease or other contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement (each, a
"CONTRACT") binding upon SPX or any of its subsidiaries (each, an "SPX
CONTRACT"), that is required to be described in the SPX Securities Reports has
been described in the SPX Securities Reports, and all of the SPX Contracts that
are required to be filed as exhibits thereto are filed as exhibits thereto.

Adverse Effect on SPX.

                                  SCHEDULE "E"

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UDI

         UDI hereby represents and warrants to and in favour of SPX as follows,
except as otherwise disclosed in the corresponding Sections or Subsections of
the UDI Disclosure Letter:

SECTION E.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.

         UDI is a corporation duly continued under and governed by the CBCA and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Each of UDI's subsidiaries is a corporation duly
incorporated and organized and validly existing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. UDI and each of its
subsidiaries is duly registered to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties, owned or leased, or the
nature of its activities make such registration necessary, except where the
failure to be so registered or in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI. The copies of UDI's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws filed or incorporated by reference in
UDI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 (as
amended by Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A), ("UDI'S 1999 FORM 10-K") are
complete and correct, have not been amended and are in full force and effect.

SECTION E.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT.

         UDI has the requisite corporate authority to enter into this Agreement
and to carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
UDI's Board of Directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of UDI
are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Transactions (except for
obtaining shareholder approval of the Arrangement Resolution). The Board of
Directors of UDI, at a meeting duly called and held at which a quorum was
present throughout, has unanimously determined (a) that the Transactions are in
the best interest of UDI and its shareholders and (b) to recommend to UDI's
shareholders that they vote their UDI Shares in favor of the Transactions (the
"UDI BOARD RECOMMENDATION"), and the UDI Board Recommendation has not been
revoked or modified. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by UDI
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of UDI enforceable
against UDI in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.

SECTION E.3 NO VIOLATIONS.

(1)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by UDI, the
         consummation of the Transactions nor compliance by UDI with any of the
         provisions hereof will: (i) violate, conflict with, or result in breach
         of any provision of or the creation of any rights in favour of another
         party under, require any consent, approval or notice under, or
         constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time
         or both, would constitute a default) or result in a right of
         termination or acceleration or any other change in any of the rights or
         obligations of any party under, or result in a creation of any lien,
         security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties or
         assets of UDI or any of its subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of (x) the UDI Governing Documents or the
         comparable governing documents of any of its subsidiaries or (y) any
         note, bond, mortgage, indenture, loan agreement, deed of trust,
         agreement, lien, or other Contract, instrument or obligation to which
         UDI or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of them, or
         any of their respective properties or assets, may be subject or by
         which UDI or any of its subsidiaries is bound; or (ii) subject to
         compliance with the statutes and regulations referred to in Section
         E.3(2) below, violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction,
         determination, award, decree or Law applicable to UDI or any of its
         subsidiaries (except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii)
         above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or
         terminations which would not, or any consents, approvals or notices
         which, if not given or received, would not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI).

(2)      No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration or
         filing with, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained in
         connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
         consummation of the Transactions other than (A) any approvals required

         Director under the CBCA, (D) the Regulatory Approvals relating to UDI,
         (E) consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, declarations or
         filings of or with any Governmental Authority that are required solely
         as a result of the identity or legal or regulatory status of SPX and
         (F) any other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
         declarations, or filings of or with a Governmental Authority which if
         not obtained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

SECTION E.4 CAPITALIZATION.

         The authorized share capital of UDI consists of an unlimited number of
common shares and an unlimited number of preferred shares, issuable in series.
As of March 1, 2001, 39,134,539 UDI Shares and no preferred shares were issued
and outstanding, and 3,040,020 UDI Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to
the exercise of outstanding UDI Options in that amount granted under the Stock
Option Plan and set forth in Section


                                      E-2
<PAGE>   84

E.4 of the UDI Disclosure Letter. Except for the aforesaid 3,040,020 UDI
Options, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements or
commitments of any character whatsoever ("UDI SHARE ARRANGEMENTS") requiring the
issuance, grant, sale or transfer by UDI of any shares of UDI (including the UDI
Shares) or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for,
or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any shares of UDI (including the UDI
Shares) (collectively with the shares of UDI, "UDI SECURITIES"), nor are there
any outstanding stock appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments based upon the book value, income or
other attribute of UDI ("UDI PHANTOM RIGHTS"). Since March 1, 2001, there have
been no increases to any of the amounts set forth above, other than increases in
the number of outstanding UDI Shares by reason of issuance of UDI Shares upon
exercise of any of the outstanding UDI Options set forth above, which issuances
have reduced the number of such outstanding UDI Options by a corresponding
amount. There are no obligations of UDI or any subsidiary to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any UDI Securities. All outstanding UDI Shares have been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are
not subject to, nor were they issued in violation of, any preemptive rights, and
all UDI Shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding UDI Options in accordance
with their respective terms will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and will not be subject to any preemptive rights.

SECTION E.5 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2000, there has not been any event, occurrence or
development, alone or taken together with all other existing facts, that,
individually or in the aggregate, has a Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

SECTION E.6 NO UNDISCLOSED MATERIAL LIABILITIES.

         Neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise (and
whether or not the subject of any other representation or warranty hereunder),
except (a) liabilities or obligations reserved against or disclosed in the
audited consolidated financial statements of UDI as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000 (the "UDI 2000 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") (copies of which
audited consolidated financial statements have been previously delivered to SPX)
or disclosed in the footnotes thereto or otherwise disclosed in UDI's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2000 or UDI's 1999 Form
10-K to the extent not superceded by the UDI 2000 Financial Statements (in each
case, in the amount or of the magnitude so reserved against or disclosed), and
(b) liabilities or obligations which do not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

SECTION E.7 BROKERAGE FEES.

         UDI has not retained (nor will it retain) any financial advisor,
broker, agent or finder or paid or agreed to pay any financial advisor, broker,
agent or finder on account of


                                      E-3
<PAGE>   85

this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any other transactions presently
ongoing or contemplated, except that BMO Nesbitt Burns, Inc. ("BMO NESBITT
BURNS"), J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. ("J.P. MORGAN") and Lincoln Partners LLC
have been retained as UDI's financial advisors in connection with certain
matters, including the Transactions. UDI has delivered to SPX a true and
complete copy of its agreements with each of BMO Nesbitt Burns, J.P. Morgan and
Lincoln Partners LLC.

SECTION E.8 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

         Since September 30, 2000, neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries has
taken any action (i) that would be in violation of Section 6.1(b), Section
6.1(c)(x), Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.1(e) of the Agreement if such provision
had been in effect since such date or (ii) that would be in violation in any
material respect of any other provision of Section 6.1 of the Agreement if such
provision had been in effect since such date.

SECTION E.9 REPORTS.

(1)      UDI has timely filed with the Securities Authorities all forms,
         reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed
         by it since December 31, 1997 under the Securities Laws (such
         documents, as supplemented or amended since the time of filing, and
         including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated
         by reference therein, the "UDI SECURITIES REPORTS"). UDI has heretofore
         delivered to SPX true and complete copies of the UDI Securities
         Reports. As of their respective dates, the UDI Securities Reports did
         not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
         material fact that is required to be stated therein or that is
         necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, and complied in all material
         respects with all applicable requirements of Law. The audited financial
         statements and unaudited interim financial statements (including any
         related notes or schedules) of UDI and its consolidated subsidiaries
         publicly issued by UDI, or included or incorporated by reference in the
         UDI Securities Reports and the UDI 2000 Financial Statements, were
         prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
         Canada consistently applied (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such
         financial statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited
         statements, in the related report of UDI's independent accountants; or
         (ii) in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to the
         extent they may not include footnotes or may be condensed or summary
         statements), and fairly present the consolidated financial position,
         results of operations and changes in financial position of UDI and its
         consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods
         indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim
         financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which,
         individually or in the aggregate, would not be material in amount or
         effect).



                                      E-4
<PAGE>   86

(2)      UDI will deliver to SPX as soon as they become available true and
         complete copies of any UDI Securities Report filed by it with
         Securities Authorities subsequent to the date hereof. As of their
         respective dates, such UDI Securities Reports (excluding any
         information therein provided by SPX, as to which UDI makes no
         representation) will not contain any misrepresentation or untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
         to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
         light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading
         and will comply in all material respects with all applicable
         requirements of Law. The financial statements of UDI and its
         consolidated subsidiaries (including any related notes or schedules)
         issued thereby or to be included or incorporated by reference in such
         UDI Securities Reports (excluding any information therein provided by
         SPX, as to which UDI makes no representation) will be prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada
         consistently applied (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such
         financial statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited
         statements, in the related report of UDI's independent accountants; or
         (ii) in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to the
         extent they may not include footnotes or may be condensed or summary
         statements) and will present fairly the consolidated financial
         position, results of operations and changes in financial position of
         UDI and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for
         the periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited
         interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments
         which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material in
         amount or effect).

(3)      UDI is a reporting issuer not in default of any of its obligations
         under Canadian Securities Laws.

(4)      UDI is a "foreign private issuer" within the meaning of Rule 3b-4 under
         the Exchange Act and is not subject to Regulation 14A under the
         Exchange Act.

SECTION E.10 U.S. REGISTRATION.

         The UDI Shares were not issued by a closed-end investment company
registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940.

SECTION E.11 SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) All of the capital stock of, or other ownership interest in, each
of UDI's subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and is
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by UDI, free and clear of any and
all liens, charges, security interests, adverse claims, encumbrances and demands
of any nature or kind whatsoever. There are no existing UDI Share Arrangements
requiring the issuance, grant, sale or transfer by any UDI subsidiary of any
shares of any UDI subsidiary or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any shares of
any UDI subsidiary (collectively with shares of any UDI


                                      E-5
<PAGE>   87

subsidiary, "UDI SUBSIDIARY SECURITIES"), nor are there any outstanding stock
appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements
or commitments based upon the book value, income or other attribute of any UDI
subsidiary ("UDI SUBSIDIARY PHANTOM RIGHTS"). There are no obligations of UDI or
any subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any UDI Subsidiary
Securities. None of the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of any of UDI's subsidiaries purport to grant rights to
any Person or group other than (1) customary rights with respect to corporate
governance given to all shareholders pro rata in accordance with their holdings
and (2) customary rights of indemnification of directors and officers.

         (b) A complete listing of UDI's subsidiaries, other than inactive
subsidiaries with less than $1,000,000 in assets or liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) (the "UDI INACTIVE SUBSIDIARIES") is set forth in
Section E.11(b) of the UDI Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in Section
E.11(b) of the UDI Disclosure Letter, neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, business association
or other entity other than the UDI Inactive Subsidiaries.

SECTION E.12 LITIGATION.

         There is no litigation, suit, claim, action, prosecution, proceeding or
governmental investigation pending or, to the knowledge of UDI, threatened
against or relating to UDI or any of its subsidiaries (including, for greater
certainty, with respect to any environmental or employee matters) that (i)
involves a claim against UDI or any of its subsidiaries that (x) could
reasonably be expected to result in damages in excess of $1,000,000 or seeks
damages in excess of $5,000,000, (y) seeks injunctive or other equitable relief
or (z) individually or in the aggregate, would, if successful (and regardless of
amount), have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI; or (ii) in any manner challenges
or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay or limit the performance
of this Agreement by UDI or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
UDI (or any of its subsidiaries) nor any property or asset of UDI (or any of its
subsidiaries) is subject to any Governmental Order which, individually or in the
aggregate, would prevent UDI from performing its material obligations under this
Agreement or has a Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

SECTION E.13 ENVIRONMENTAL.

(1)      UDI and its subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with all
         applicable environmental Laws, except for non-compliance that does not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         UDI.

(2)      Since December 31, 1998, neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries has
         ever received any notice of or been prosecuted for material
         non-compliance with any


                                      E-6
<PAGE>   88

         environmental Laws, nor has UDI or any of its subsidiaries settled any
         allegation of non-compliance short of prosecution.

(3)      There are no actual or, to the knowledge of UDI, threatened orders,
         warnings or directions relating to environmental matters requiring any
         work, repair or construction or capital expenditures to be made with
         respect to any of UDI's or any of its subsidiaries' properties or
         operations, nor has UDI or any of its subsidiaries received notice of
         any of the same, that, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

(4)      There is not on, in or under any property currently or, to UDI's
         knowledge, previously owned, leased, managed, controlled or operated by
         UDI or any of its subsidiaries any of the following: (1) underground
         storage tanks or surface impoundments, (2) asbestos-containing
         materials, (3) polychlorinated biphenyls, or (4) other "Hazardous
         Substances" (as such term is defined under the Comprehensive
         Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42
         U.S.C. Section 9601, et seq., as amended as of the date hereof) or
         "contaminants" (as such term is defined in the Ontario Environmental
         Protection Act) or petroleum products, in each case which would
         reasonably be expected to form the basis of liability or other
         obligation of UDI or any of its subsidiaries under any applicable
         environmental Laws except for such liabilities or obligations which do
         not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
         on UDI.

SECTION E.14 TAX MATTERS.

(1)      UDI and its subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns required to
         be filed by applicable Law with respect to each of UDI and its
         subsidiaries or any of their income, properties or operations, except
         where the failure to file does not, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI. All such Tax Returns are true,
         accurate and complete and accurately set forth all items required to be
         reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable Tax Laws,
         except to the extent that any inaccuracies in filed Tax Returns do not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
         UDI. UDI and its subsidiaries have timely paid all Taxes attributable
         to each of UDI and its subsidiaries that were due and payable without
         regard to whether such Taxes have been assessed, except to the extent
         that failure to pay does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on UDI. UDI has made available to SPX complete
         and accurate copies of all United States and Canadian federal, state,
         provincial, local and foreign income tax and corporate tax returns, and
         any amendments thereto, filed by or on behalf of UDI or any of its
         subsidiaries or any member of a group of corporations including UDI or
         any of its subsidiaries for the taxable years ending 1997, 1998 and
         1999.



                                      E-7
<PAGE>   89

(2)      There are no pending or, to the knowledge of UDI, threatened audits,
         examinations, investigations, deficiencies, claims or other proceedings
         relating to Taxes of UDI or any of its subsidiaries. UDI and its
         subsidiaries have made adequate provisions in accordance with Canadian
         generally accepted accounting principles appropriately and consistently
         applied to each of UDI and its subsidiaries in the consolidated
         financial statements included in the UDI Securities Reports referred to
         in Section E.9(1) and in the UDI 2000 Financial Statements for the
         payment of all Taxes for which UDI and its subsidiaries may be liable
         for the periods covered thereby that were not yet due and payable as of
         the dates thereof, regardless of whether the liability for such Taxes
         is disputed. None of UDI or any of its subsidiaries is liable for Taxes
         in respect of the period after the date of such consolidated financial
         statements other than in respect of Taxes arising in the ordinary
         course of business and Taxes that do not, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

(3)      There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory
         period of limitation applicable to any material Tax Return of UDI or
         any of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, any waiver or
         other arrangement providing for an extension of time with respect to
         the filing of any such Tax Return, the payment of any Tax or the
         issuance of an assessment or reassessment. Neither UDI nor any of its
         subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code.
         Neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries (i) has any Tax liability under
         United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or analogous state,
         provincial, local, or foreign law provision for the Tax liabilities of
         any entity other than UDI or any of its subsidiaries, or as a
         transferee or successor, except to the extent any such liabilities do
         not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
         on UDI, or (ii) is a party to a Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreement
         or any other agreement of a similar nature with any entity other than
         UDI or any of its subsidiaries that remains in effect and under which
         UDI or any such subsidiary could have any material liability for Taxes.
         Neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries has liability for the Taxes of
         another Person pursuant to Section 160 of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
         (the "ITA")or any analogous provincial provision. No claim has been
         made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where UDI or
         any of its subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that UDI or any of
         its subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction
         where such claim, if determined adversely to UDI or such subsidiary,
         would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
         on UDI. Neither UDI nor any subsidiary that is not a domestic
         corporation within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code is or has
         ever been engaged in a trade or business in the United States for
         United States federal income tax purposes, nor does UDI or any such
         subsidiary own any "United States real property Interest" within the
         meaning of Section 897 of the Code. Neither UDI nor any of its
         subsidiaries is or has been a controlled foreign corporation within the
         meaning of Section 957 of the Code.



                                      E-8
<PAGE>   90

(4)      There has been no change in ownership of UDI or any of its subsidiaries
         that has caused the utilization of any losses of such entities to be
         limited pursuant to Subsections 111(4) or (5) of the ITA or any similar
         provincial provisions. UDI and each of its subsidiaries has withheld or
         collected all amounts required to be withheld or collected by it on
         account of Taxes and has remitted all such amounts to the appropriate
         Tax authority when required by Law to do so, except where the failure
         to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
         Adverse Effect on UDI. With respect to any taxable period ended prior
         to December 31, 1994, all United States federal and state income Tax
         Returns and Canadian federal and provincial income and capital Tax
         Returns of UDI and its subsidiaries have been audited by the relevant
         Taxing Authority or are closed by the applicable statue of limitations.
         None of UDI or any of its subsidiaries has entered into an agreement
         contemplated by Section 191.3 of the ITA. For all transactions between
         UDI or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any non-resident
         Person with whom UDI or such subsidiary was not dealing at
         arm's-length, for the purposes of the ITA, on the other hand, during a
         taxation year commencing after 1998 and ending before the Effective
         Date, UDI or such subsidiary has made or obtained records or documents
         that satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 247(4)(a) to (c) of the
         ITA. UDI and each of its subsidiaries is in full compliance with all
         terms and conditions of any Tax exemptions or other Tax-sparing
         agreement or order of a foreign government and the consummation of the
         Transactions shall not have any adverse effect on the continued
         validity and effectiveness of any such Tax exemptions or other
         Tax-sparing agreement or order.

SECTION E.15 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

         UDI and each of its subsidiaries each:

                  (a) conducts its businesses in compliance with all Laws
applicable thereto or to its employees or properties;

                  (b) has all permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and
approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with, all
Governmental Authorities that are required in order to permit it to conduct its
businesses substantially as presently conducted; all such permits, licenses,
authorizations, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to UDI's
knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened; and

                  (c) has received, since December 31, 1998, no notification or
communication from any Governmental Authority (i) asserting that it is not in
compliance with any Laws or Governmental Orders, (ii) threatening to revoke any
permit, license, authorization, order or approval, or (iii) failing to approve
any proposed



                                      E-9
<PAGE>   91

acquisition, or stating the intention not to approve any acquisition proposed to
be effected by it within a certain time period or indefinitely;

except for instances which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on UDI.

SECTION E.16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

                  (a) True and complete copies of all UDI Benefit Plans and
related documents, and all amendments thereto, have been made available to SPX.

                  (b) UDI has administered each UDI Benefit Plan in all material
respects in accordance with the terms thereof and all applicable Laws and all
contributions, premiums and payments required to be made under the terms of any
UDI Benefit Plan have been made. Each UDI Benefit Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and UDI is not aware of
any circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified status of
such plan. UDI has made available to SPX reasonably acceptable evidence that
each UDI Canadian Pension Plan and all amendments thereto have been accepted for
registration by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and any provincial
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such UDI Canadian Pension Plan.
Nothing has occurred which would result in the revocation of the registration of
any UDI Canadian Pension Plan under the ITA and any applicable provincial
pension legislation. All amounts paid by UDI under the provisions of the UDI
Canadian Pension Plans will be deductible for income tax purposes.

                  (c) No material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by UDI or any of its subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate. No Pension Plan of UDI or any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in
Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived.

                  (d) Each UDI Canadian Pension Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan is fully funded on both a "going concern" and a "solvency" basis,
as determined in accordance with the actuarial assumptions and methods used in
the most recent actuarial report filed with (and accepted for filing by) the
applicable Governmental Authorities in respect of each such UDI Canadian Pension
Plan. There has been no withdrawal by UDI of assets from any UDI Canadian
Pension Plan and no application for approval of a withdrawal of assets has been
made to any Governmental Authority. Any application of surplus assets in any of
the UDI Canadian Pension Plans to offset required employer contributions to such
UDI Canadian Pension Plans has been permitted by Law and was permitted under the
terms of the relevant UDI Canadian Pension Plan and associated funding
agreement.


                                      E-10
<PAGE>   92

                  (e) All liabilities for benefits arising out of or relating to
each UDI Benefit Plan established or operated pursuant to the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada (i) have been determined in
accordance with the terms of the applicable plan document, applicable Law and
actuarial assumptions appropriate for such jurisdiction and in a manner that
fairly reflects the total liabilities of the applicable UDI Benefit Plan, and
(ii) have been accurately reserved against or disclosed in the audited
consolidated financial statements of UDI.

                  (f) The execution of this Agreement or the performance of the
Transactions will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) (i) constitute an event under any UDI Benefit Plan,
employment, termination or severance Contract or other Officer Obligation, trust
or loan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current
or former employee, officer or director, or (ii) result in the triggering or
imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the right of UDI or SPX to
amend or terminate any UDI Benefit Plan and receive the full amount of any
excess assets remaining or resulting from such amendment or termination, subject
to applicable Taxes. The execution of this Agreement or performance of the
Transactions will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) result in any payment or benefit being made by UDI, SPX, or
any of their respective affiliates with respect to any employee of UDI that will
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment," within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

                  (g) Neither UDI, any of its subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any benefit plan which
provides life insurance, medical, severance or other employee welfare benefits
to any of its employees upon his retirement or termination of employment, except
as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or any other Law.

                  (h) Neither UDI, any of its subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any withdrawal liability
(within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA) with respect to any Multi-Employer
Plan which liability has not been fully paid as of the date hereof. As of the
Effective Time, UDI, each of its subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate will not
have completely or partially withdrawn from any Multi-Employer Plan and will not
be subject to any withdrawal liability as described in Section 4201 of ERISA for
withdrawals that have occurred on or prior to the Effective Date. Neither UDI,
any of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has knowledge that any
Multi-Employer Plan fails to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, is
insolvent or is in reorganization within the meaning of Part 3 of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA.

                  (i) UDI and each of its subsidiaries (i) is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment, employment
practices, labor,





                                      E-11

terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours; and (ii) has withheld
all material amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld from the
wages, salaries and other payments to its employees.

                  (j) No work stoppage or labor strike against UDI or any of its

labor matters, including, without limitation, violation of any federal, state or
local labor, safety or employment laws (domestic or foreign), charges of unfair
labor practices or discrimination complaints; or (ii) has engaged in any
material unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.

                  (k) Schedule E.16(k) of the UDI Disclosure Letter lists all
Officer Obligations to (a) any directors or officers of UDI or any subsidiary,
and (ii) any employee of UDI or any subsidiary involving payments to such
employee in excess of $100,000 per year or $200,000 in the aggregate. True and
complete copies of all Contracts reflecting or relating to Officer Obligations
that are required to be disclosed on Schedule E.16 (k) of the UDI Disclosure
Letter have been delivered to SPX.

SECTION E.17 INSURANCE.

                  Section E.17 of the UDI Disclosure Letter is a true and
complete description of all policies of fire, liability, production, completion
bond, errors and omissions, workmen's compensation and other forms of insurance
owned or held by UDI or any of its subsidiaries currently in effect or in effect
at any time since December 31, 1999 covering the assets, business, operations,
officers, directors or employees of UDI or any of its subsidiaries. All current
insurance policies are in full force and effect, all premiums with respect
thereto covering all periods up to and including the Effective Time have been
paid or will be paid prior to the Effective Time, and no notice of cancellation
or termination has been received with respect to any such policy. Such policies
(i) are sufficient for compliance with all requirements of Law and of all
Contracts to which UDI or any of its subsidiaries is a party, (ii) cover the
respective policy periods and the risks or matters, and provide the coverage
(including any deductibles or retentions), set forth in Section E.17 of the UDI
Disclosure Letter and (iii) will not in any way be affected by, or terminate or
lapse by reason of, the Transactions. During the last three years, neither UDI
nor any of its subsidiaries has been refused any insurance with respect to its
assets or operations, nor has its coverage been limited, by any insurance
carrier to which it has applied for any such insurance or with which it has
carried insurance. Neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
notice of increase in premiums with respect to, or cancellation or non-renewal
of, any of its insurance policies, and neither UDI nor any of its subsidiaries
has made any claim against an insurance policy as to which the insurer is
denying coverage or defending the claim under a reservation of rights.
