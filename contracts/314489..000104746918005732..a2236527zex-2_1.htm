AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (together with all exhibits and schedules, this "Agreement") is entered into as of August 21, 2018, by and between First Busey Corporation, a Nevada corporation ("Acquiror"), and The Banc Ed Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

  

    
RECITALS 

  

 A. The boards of directors of the Company and Acquiror have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Acquiror (the "Merger"), with Acquiror as the surviving entity in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Entity"). 

  

 B. The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  

 C. As an inducement to Acquiror to enter into this Agreement, the directors and executive officers of the Company in office as of the date of this Agreement have, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, entered into a Voting and Support Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. 

  

 D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the parties also agree to certain prescribed conditions to the Merger and other transactions. 

  

    
AGREEMENTS 

  

 In consideration of the foregoing premises and the following mutual promises, covenants and agreements, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER 

  

    Section 1.1 _ The Merger. _ Provided that this Agreement
shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express
terms, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the NRS and the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Acquiror pursuant to
the provisions of, and with the effects provided in, the NRS and the DGCL,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquiror will
be the Surviving Entity.

   

    
 Section 1.2 _ Effective Time; Closing_.  

  

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not prior thereto have been terminated in accordance with its express terms, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur through the mail or at a place that is mutually acceptable to Acquiror and the Company, or if they fail to agree, at the offices of Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum and Nagelberg LLP, located at 200 West Madison Street, Suite 3900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article 8 and Article 9 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company may agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). Subject to the provisions of Article 10, failure to consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.     

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree to file on the Closing Date articles of merger with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada Articles of Merger"), and a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State (the "Delaware Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the Nevada Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

  

  

    
 Section 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger. _ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the NRS and the DGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity. 

  

    
 Section 1.4 _ Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity. _ The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

    
 Section 1.5 _ Bank Merger. _ The parties will cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to effect the Bank Merger at a time to be determined following the Merger. At the effective time of the Bank Merger, the separate existence of the Bank will terminate. Acquiror Bank will be the surviving bank and will continue its existence under applicable Legal Requirements. The Bank Merger shall be accomplished pursuant to the statutory bank merger agreement in form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. 

   

    
 Section 1.6 _ Alternative Structure. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, the parties may mutually agree to change the method of effecting the Contemplated Transactions if and to the extent that they deem such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , that: (a) any such change shall not affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock; and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as consideration in the Merger, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) require submission to or approval of the Company\'s stockholders after the Merger has been approved by the Company\'s stockholders. If the parties agree to make such a change, they shall execute appropriate documents to reflect the change. 

  

    
ARTICLE 2 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

   

    Section 2.1 _ Consideration. _ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, the
Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

  

  

 (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or Acquiror (in each case other than shares of Company Common Stock held in any Company Benefit Plan or related trust accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive the following consideration: 

    

 (i) $111.53 (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"); and 

  

 (ii) 8.2067 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock Consideration" and, together with the Per Share Cash Consideration, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). 

    

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of 

  

      

  

any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if
a stock dividend on shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be declared with a
record date within such period, then the number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock issued to holders of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time pursuant
to this Agreement will be appropriately and proportionally adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Cancellation of Shares. _ At the Effective Time, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. Certificates (it being understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" be deemed to include reference to any book-entry account statement relating to the ownership of Company Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender thereof, the Per Share Merger Consideration subject to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.1 to the contrary, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock held in the Company\'s treasury will be cancelled and no Per Share Merger Consideration will be issued or paid in exchange thereof. 

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ No Fractional Shares. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued as Per Share Stock Consideration in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this Article 2 shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying the Closing Acquiror Common Stock Price by the fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled. 

  

    
 Section 2.4 _ Exchange of Certificates_.  

  

  

 (a) The parties to this Agreement agree: (i) that Computershare Trust Company, N.A. shall serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent"); and (ii) to execute and deliver the exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) the aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) the aggregate cash consideration to be paid as Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1; and (iii) sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.3. Such amount of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the "Conversion Fund." 

   

 (c) Within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), in a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

      

  

 (d) Upon proper surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor his, her or its Per Share Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3 deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate; thereupon such Company Stock Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate. 

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Outstanding Company Shares. 

  

 (f) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such holder\'s Company Common Stock shall have been converted. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Conversion Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity, or its successors in interest, for issuance and payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (including the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders\' shares of Company Common Stock), as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, and in accordance with this Article 2, the Per Share Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders\' shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock). 

  

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ Dissenting Shares. _ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who properly shall have demanded payment of the fair value for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenters\' Shares") shall not be converted into or 

        

represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL,
except that all Dissenters\' Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their

 (j) No event has occurred, or to the Company\'s Knowledge, circumstance exists that could result in a material increase in premium costs of Company Benefit Plans or a material increase in benefit costs of such Company Benefit Plans that are self-insured as compared to the Company\'s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

 Section 4.7 _ Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory Filings. _ 

  

  

 (a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to 

  

      

  

form in all material respects, as of their respective filing dates and
effective dates, as the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder which are applicable to Acquiror. The
Acquiror SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates,
none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

   

 (b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the "Acquiror Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. As of the date hereof, RSM US LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of Acquiror. 

  

 (c) Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries. Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a 15 and 15d 15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Acquiror\'s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. 

  

 (d) Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of ICFR. Acquiror\'s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquiror\'s ICFR as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange Act (the "Acquiror Evaluation Date"). Acquiror presented in such quarterly report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of Acquiror\'s ICFR based on their evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror Evaluation Date, there have been no changes in Acquiror\'s ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Acquiror\'s ICFR. Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. 

  

      

  

 (e) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2016, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. 

   

 (f) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2016 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 303.2(r). 

  

  

    
 Section 4.8 _ Books and Records. _ The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with Acquiror\'s business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and transactions included therein. 

  

    
 Section 4.9 _ Properties. _ Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all assets and properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, that it purports to own, other than OREO, subject to no liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind except: (i) as noted in the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements and incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the most recent Acquiror Financial Statements; (ii) statutory liens for Taxes not yet delinquent or being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been established and reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements; (iii) pledges or liens required to be granted in connection with the acceptance of government deposits, granted in connection with repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements, securing any discount with, borrowing from, or obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank, interbank credit facilities or any transaction by Acquiror Bank acting in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iv) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the present use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair the present business operations at such properties; (v) minor defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they are held as of the date of this Agreement; (vi) liens or deposits in connection with worker\'s compensation, unemployment insurance, social security or other insurance; (vii) inchoate mechanic\'s and materialmen\'s liens for construction in progress and workmen\'s, repairmen\'s, warehousemen\'s and carrier\'s liens arising in the Ordinary Course of Business of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank consistent with past practice; (viii) liens existing on any asset of any Person at the time such Person is acquired by or is combined with Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, provided the lien was not created in contemplation of that event; (ix) liens on property required by Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve; and (x) liens incidental to the conduct of business or ownership of property of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries which do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of the property or materially impair the use thereof as of the date of this Agreement. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries as lessee has the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use, possess and control any and all of the respective property leased by it, and each such lease is valid and without default thereunder by the lessee or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, the lessor. 

       

                                    

    

    
 Section 4.10 _ Loan Loss Reserve_.  

  

  

 (a) Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis of Acquiror Bank\'s continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of each loan, loan agreement, note, lease or other borrowing agreement by Acquiror Bank, any participation therein, and any guaranty, renewal or extension thereof (the "Acquiror Loans") under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Bank\'s internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans. 

  

 (b) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances in excess of Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off. 

  

  

    
 Section 4.11 _ Taxes_.  

  

  

 (a) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and each such Tax Return was true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not reflected in Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any Regulatory Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except such Taxes as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. 

  

 (b) There is no claim or assessment pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe. No audit, examination or investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is presently being conducted or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened by any Regulatory Authority. Neither Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries are the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and there are no liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of Acquiror\'s or its Subsidiaries\' assets. Neither Acquiror nor its Subsidiaries has executed an extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax that is currently in effect. 

  

 (c) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have delivered or made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns relating to income taxes and franchise taxes owed by Acquiror and its Subsidiaries with respect to the last three (3) fiscal years. 

   

 (d) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have not engaged in any transaction that could materially affect the Tax liability for any Tax Returns not closed by applicable statute of limitations: (i) which is a "reportable transaction" or a "listed transaction" or (ii) a "significant purpose of which is the avoidance or evasion of U.S. federal income tax" within the meaning of Sections 6662, 6662A, 6011, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or of the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder or pursuant to notices or other guidance published by the IRS (irrespective of the effective dates). 

  

  

    
 Section 4.12 _ Employee Benefits_.  

  

  

 (a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible terminations of employment in connection 

  

      

  

therewith) will cause a payment, vesting, increase or acceleration of
benefits or benefit entitlements under any Acquiror Benefit Plan or any other
increase in the liabilities of Acquiror or any Subsidiary under any Acquiror
Benefit Plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (b) With respect to any Acquiror Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional employer organization, such Acquiror Benefit Plan complies in all respects with the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled individuals. Neither Acquiror nor any of the Acquiror ERISA Affiliates sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or could have any liability with respect to, any Acquiror Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA). No Acquiror Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets. 

   

 (c) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination letter, or, in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to Acquiror\'s Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Acquiror Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust. 

   

 (d) Each Acquiror Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (e) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to Acquiror\'s Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Acquiror Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Acquiror Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Acquiror Benefit Plan document or related agreement. 

   

 (f) No Acquiror Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any liability to any Acquiror Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Acquiror Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. To Acquiror\'s Knowledge, no disqualified person (as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(2)) of any Acquiror Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt prohibited transaction (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406). 

   

 (g) All accrued contributions and other payments to be made by Acquiror or any Subsidiary to any Acquiror Benefit Plan have been made or reserves adequate for such purposes will have been set aside therefore and reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements. 

  

 (h) No condition exists as a result of which Acquiror or any Subsidiary would have any material liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Acquiror Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for Acquiror or any Subsidiary as an independent contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals participating in Acquiror 

  

      

  

Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and authorized to participate in such
Acquiror Benefit Plan in all material respects.

  

 (i) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries have any material liabilities to employees or former employees that are not reflected in the Acquiror Benefit Plans.

To the Knowledge of Acquiror, since January 1, 2016, none of the foregoing has been threatened by any Regulatory Authority. 

  

  

    
 Section 4.15 _ Absence of Certain Changes and Events. _ Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. 

  

    
 Section 4.16 _ Compliance with Environmental Laws. _ There are no actions,  suits, investigations, liabilities, inquiries, Proceedings or Orders involving Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that are pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, nor to the Knowledge of Acquiror, is there any factual basis for any of the foregoing, as a result of any asserted failure of

Knowledge of Acquiror, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is the
owner of any interest in real estate on which any substances have been
generated, used, stored, deposited, treated, recycled or disposed of, which
substances if known to be present on, at or under such property, would

other remedial action under any Environmental Law at such property or any
impacted adjacent or down gradient property, except where such action would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.
Except for any matters that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected

Acquiror, Acquiror and each Subsidiary of Acquiror has complied in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its
business operations.

 Section 7.5 _ Tax Free Reorganization. _ 

  

  

 (a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror knowingly shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Within forty-five (45) days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall comply with the reporting requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its United States federal income Tax Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. 

  

 (b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason: (i) why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the "IRS Guidelines"), to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, respectively, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion required by Section 9.8. The Company will deliver such certificates to counsel to the Company and counsel to Acquiror. 

  

      

  

 (c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror does not know of any reason: (i) why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in Sections 8.8 and 9.8, certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Sections 8.8 and 9.8, respectively, and Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror would not be able to deliver the opinion required by Section 8.8. Acquiror will deliver such certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.6 _ Employees and Employee Benefits. _ 

  

  

 (a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing ("Covered Employees") shall automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee\'s continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan). 

  

 (b) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods (but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. 

  

 (c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the extent such eligible expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

      

  

 (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s severance policies immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.6(e), following the Effective Time, Acquiror or Acquiror\'s Subsidiary will cause any eligible Covered Employee (exempt and non-exempt) to be covered by a severance policy under which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment will be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth on Section 7.6(d) of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Covered Employee eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by the Merger under an employment, change in control, severance, salary continuation agreement or other agreement (a "CIC Payment") shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this Section 7.6(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits. Any Covered Employee who waives and relinquishes his or her right to a CIC Payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in this Section 7.6(d). 

  

 (e) Any Company employee who has or is party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement, salary continuation agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for a CIC Payment shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in Section 7.6(d) but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement, provided that, on or before the Closing Date, the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of the CIC Payment shall be reduced such that the value of the Total Payments that each counterparty is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code. At the request of Acquiror, the Company shall seek a shareholder vote under Section 280G of the Code for approval of the CIC Payments prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.7 _ Takeover Laws. _ If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal Requirement is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement on the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 7.8 _ Section 16 Matters. _ Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any acquisitions or dispositions of Acquiror Common Stock resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

    
 Section 7.9 _ Stockholder Litigation. _ Each of the Company and Acquiror shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

RECITALS 

  

 A. As of the date hereof, each Principal Stockholder is the owner or controls the vote of the number of shares of the Company\'s common stock, $2.00 par value per share ("Company Stock"), as is set forth opposite such Principal Stockholder\'s name on the signature page attached hereto.

 Section 1. _ _ _Definitions; Construction._ All terms that are capitalized and used herein (and are not otherwise specifically defined herein) shall be used in this Agreement as defined in the Merger Agreement. The parties hereby incorporate by this reference the principles of construction set forth in Section 12.2 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 2. _ _ _Representations and Warranties._ Each Principal Stockholder represents and warrants that as of the date hereof, he or she:

 (b) has the sole, or joint with any other Principal Stockholder, voting power with respect to such shares of Company Stock; and 

  

 (c) has all necessary power and authority to enter into this Agreement and further represents and warrants that this Agreement is the legal, valid and binding agreement of such Principal Stockholder, and is enforceable against such Principal Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Legal Requirements affecting creditors\' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity. 

  

  

    
 Section 3. _ _ _Voting Agreement._ Each Principal Stockholder hereby agrees that at any meeting of the Company\'s stockholders however called, and in any action by written consent of the Company\'s stockholders, such Principal Stockholder shall vote, or cause to be voted, all shares of Company Stock      

now or at any time hereafter owned or controlled by him or her at the time of
such meeting of the Company\'s stockholders:

  

  

 (a) in favor of the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions as described in the Merger Agreement; 

  

 (b) against any Acquisition Proposal involving any party other than Acquiror or an Affiliate of Acquiror; and

which the Company publicly discloses that the board of directors of the

directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that to, or to continue to, recommend the Merger Agreement
to the Company\'s stockholders would result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; or (d) February 1, 2020.

  

    
 Section 7. _ _ _Amendment and Modification._ This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time by the written approval of such amendment, modification or supplement by the Company, Acquiror and all of the Principal Stockholders.

 Section 9. _ _ _Absence of Control._ Subject to any specific provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that Acquiror by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed (until consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) to control, directly or indirectly, the Company and shall not exercise, or be deemed to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Company.

 Section 13. _ _ _Governing Law._ All questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Illinois applicable to agreements made and wholly to be performed in such state without regard to conflicts of laws.
