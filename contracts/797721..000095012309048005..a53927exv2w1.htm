 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, so that after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (d) The "Per Share Merger Consideration" shall be the sum of (i) the dollar amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Adjusted Cash Consideration divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Share Amount (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"), _plus_ (ii) the number of 

   ##### 

  

   

shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the Adjusted Stock
Consideration divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Share Amount (the "Per
Share Stock Consideration"),  _plus_ (iii) the aggregate principal amount of
New Notes equal to the quotient of (x) the Adjusted New Notes Consideration
divided by (y) the Fully Diluted Company Share Amount (the "Per Share Notes
Consideration"). 

   

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Time, the Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of an outstanding certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such share of Company Stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate as described in Section 3.2, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate. 

   

 3.2 _Payment of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) Subject to compliance with Section 3.2(b), Parent shall pay to each Company Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Stock held in the aggregate amounts set forth next to each Company Stockholders name in the Payment and Allocation Schedule (as such Schedule is adjusted in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.4(c)(iii)(A)). On the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to each Company Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) with respect to shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such holders Company Stock Certificates: (1) certificates representing the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock owned by such Company Stockholder as set forth in the Payment and Allocation Schedule (rounded to the nearest whole share), issued in the names of and in the amounts specified by such Company Stockholder by written notice to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (2) by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds, the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock owned by such Company Stockholder as set forth in the Payment and Allocation Schedule (rounded to the nearest penny), to the account or accounts specified by such Company Stockholder by written notice to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and (3) the Per Share Notes Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock owned by such Company Stockholder as set forth in the Payment and Allocation Schedule, issued in the names of and in the amounts specified by such Company Stockholder by written notice to Parent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Execution Date, the Company shall mail a Letter of Transmittal, in a form to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent (which shall contain, among other things, customary investor representations from the Company Stockholders on which Parent may rely to issue the shares of Parent Common Stock and New Notes) (the "Letter of Transmittal"), to each Company Stockholder. Upon surrender 

   ##### 

  

   

of the Company Stock Certificate or Certificates representing the Company
Stock held by each Company Stockholder, together with a duly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal at the Effective Time or thereafter,
such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificates and Company
Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Stock represented by such Company
Stock Certificate. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Company Stock
Certificate. 

   

 (c) All Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

   

 (d) In the event any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the posting of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, Parent shall pay the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Company Stock Certificate to which such holder would be entitled pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 (e) If any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to Parent any Transfer Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, unless and until the holder of such Company Stock 

   ##### 

  

   

Certificate shall surrender such certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat
or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock
Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. 

   

 (g) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. 

   

 (h) Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 3.3 _Stock Options and Warrants_. 

  

 (a) The Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) shall take all actions required pursuant to the terms of the Company Equity Plans to provide that all options to purchase shares of Company Stock issued under the Company Equity Plans, whether or not exercisable, whether or not vested, and whether or not performance-based, which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Option"), shall, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and the holder of any Company Option shall be entitled to receive in cash the positive difference, if any, between the Per Share Merger Consideration and the option exercise price per Company Option held, which the Parties acknowledge and agree shall be zero in each case. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(b), the Company shall cancel all warrants to purchase Company Stock and all other rights or options (other than Company Options which shall be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.3(a)) to purchase or acquire any securities of the Company (all of the foregoing (together with the warrants and other rights set forth on Schedule 3.3(b)), collectively, the "Company Rights") for no consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested, immediately prior to the Effective Time if not exercised prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cancel the Company 

   ##### 

  

   

Rights set forth on Schedule 3.3(b) prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
that any such cancellation shall be on terms reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) Notwithstanding Section 3.4(a), if the Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Closing Date (the "Average Closing Date Price") is greater than or equal to the Lower Limit (as defined below), Parent may elect, in Parents sole discretion, to issue additional New Notes in lieu of all or a portion of the Net Stock Amount, in which case, (x) the Aggregate New Notes Amount will be increased by the additional amount of the aggregate principal amount of such New Notes issued by Parent and (y) the Net Stock Amount will be decreased by the additional amount of the aggregate principal amount of such New Notes issued by Parent Notwithstanding Section 3.4(a), if the Average Closing Date Price is greater than or equal to the Lender Shares Lower Limit (as defined below), Parent may elect, in Parents sole discretion, to issue additional New Notes in lieu of all or a portion of the Lender Stock Amount, in which case, (x) the Aggregate New Notes Amount will be increased by the additional amount of the aggregate principal amount of such New Notes issued by Parent and (y) the Lender Stock Amount will be decreased by the additional amount of the aggregate principal amount of such New Notes issued by Parent. For purposes of this Section 3.4(b)(i), (1) the value of the Parent Common Stock used to determine the aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued in lieu of all or any portion of the Aggregate Stock Amount shall be the Average Closing Date Price and (2) the value of Parent Common Stock used to determine the commensurate decrease to the Aggregate Stock Amount (including the Lender Stock Amount) shall be the Average Closing Date Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the decrease in the number of shares of Parent Company Stock for any increase in Aggregate New Notes Amount shall be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of such increase by the Average Closing Date Price. Parent shall notify the Company of its intention to issue additional New Notes in lieu of all or any portion of the Aggregate Stock Amount (including the Lender Stock Amount) in accordance with this Section 3.4(b)(i) by delivering written notice to the Company of such intention no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding Section 3.4(a), Parent may elect, in Parents sole discretion, to pay cash in lieu of all or a portion of the Aggregate New Notes Amount; _provided_  that Parent shall pay cash in lieu of the commensurate portion of the Aggregate New Notes Amount in an amount equal to the net proceeds received by Parent from the Third Party Financing pursuant to Section 6.3(b), if any, in which case, (x) the Aggregate Cash Amount will be increased by the additional amount of cash paid by Parent and (y) the Aggregate New Notes Amount will be decreased by the additional amount of cash paid by Parent up to the Aggregate New Notes Amount. Parent shall notify the Company of its intention to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the Aggregate New Notes Amount in accordance with this Section 3.4(b)(ii) by delivering written notice to the Company of such intention no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) Notwithstanding Section 3.4(a), if the Average Closing Date Price is greater than or equal to the Lower Limit, Parent may elect, in Parents sole discretion, to pay cash in lieu of all or a portion of the Net Stock Amount, in which case, (x) the Aggregate Cash Amount will be increased by the additional amount of cash paid by 

   ##### 

  

   

Parent and (y) the Net Stock Amount will be decreased by the additional amount
of cash paid by Parent. Notwithstanding Section 3.4(a), if the Average
Closing Date Price is greater than or equal to the Lender Shares Lower Limit,
Parent may elect, in Parents sole discretion, to pay cash in lieu of all or
a portion of the Lender Stock Amount, in which case, (x) the Aggregate Cash
Amount will be increased by the additional amount of cash paid by Parent and
(y) the Lender Stock Amount will be decreased by the additional amount of
cash paid by Parent. For purposes of this Section 3.4(b)(iii), (1) the value
of the Parent Common Stock used to determine the additional cash to be paid
in lieu of all or any portion of the Aggregate Stock Amount (including the
Lender Stock Amount) shall be the Average Closing Date Price and (2) the
value of Parent Common Stock used to determine the commensurate decrease to
the Aggregate Stock Amount (including the Lender Stock Amount) shall be the
Average Closing Date Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the decrease in
the number of shares of Parent Company Stock for any increase in Aggregate
Cash Amount shall be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of such
increase by the Average Closing Date Price. Parent shall notify the Company
of its intention to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the Aggregate
Stock Amount (including the Lender Stock Amount) in accordance with
this Section 3.4(b)(iii) by delivering written notice to the Company of such

Such election by Parent shall be irrevocable. 

  

 (c) _Adjustments to Aggregate Merger Consideration_. 

    

 (i) _Average Parent Stock Price Collar_. If Parent has not exercised the election under Section 3.4(b)(iv), then the following provisions shall apply to the Aggregate Stock Amount (the adjustments set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (C) below, being referred to as the "Average Parent Stock Price Collar"):

by_ (2) the Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading
day prior to the Execution Date, _divided by_ (y) the Upper Limit. 

   

 (B) If the Average Closing Date Price is less than or equal to the Upper Limit but greater than or equal to 87.5% of the Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Execution Date (the "Lower Limit"), then the Net Stock Amount shall be the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) (1) the Net Stock Amount (prior to any other adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4, except for the adjustment pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(iv))  _multiplied by_ (2) the Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Execution Date, _divided by_ (y) the Average Closing Date Price. 

   

 (C) If the Average Closing Date Price is less than the Lower Limit, then the Net Stock Amount shall be the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) (1) the Net Stock Amount (prior to any other adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4, except for the adjustment pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(iv))  _multiplied by_ (2) the Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Execution Date, _divided by_ (y) the Lower Limit. 

   

 (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.4(c)(i), the Average Parent Stock Price Collar shall not be applicable to the Lender Stock Amount, and the following provisions shall apply to the Lender Stock Amount: 

   

(x) If the Average Closing Date Price is greater than 130.0% of the
Average Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior
to the Execution Date (the "Lender Shares Upper Limit"), then the Lender
Stock Amount shall be the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the quotient of (A) (1) the Lender Stock Amount (prior to any other
adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4, except for the adjustment pursuant
to Section 3.4(b)(iv)) _multiplied by_ (2) the Average Parent Stock Price as
of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Execution Date, 
_divided by_ (B) the Lender Shares Upper Limit. 

   

(y) If the Average Closing Date Price is less than or equal to the
Lender Shares Upper Limit but greater than or equal to 70.0% of the Average
Parent Stock Price as of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Execution Date (the "Lender Shares Lower Limit"), then the Lender
Stock Amount shall be the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the quotient of (A) (1) the Lender Stock Amount (prior to any other
adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4, except for the adjustment pursuant
to Section 3.4(b)(iv)) _multiplied by_ (2) the Average Parent Stock Price as
of the third (3rd) complete trading day prior to the Execution Date, 
_divided by_ (B) the Average Closing Date Price. 

   

(z) If the Average Closing Date Price is less than the Lender Shares
Lower Limit, then the Lender Stock Amount shall be the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) (1) the Lender Stock Amount
(prior to any other adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4, except for

For the avoidance of doubt, the Aggregate Cash Amount will not be reduced by the interest paid on the Closing Date under the Company Credit Facilities up to the Minimum Cash Interest Portion.

At the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Execution Date or the Closing Date, as applicable, then on the date of such filing), the Parent SEC Documents complied (or shall comply, as the case may be) in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained (or shall contain, as the case may be) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (or shall omit, as the case may be) to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 (b) The audited and unaudited financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents have complied (or shall comply, as the case may be) in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC in effect at the time of the filing with respect thereto. Each of such financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes or schedules to such financial statements and subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments (which are not material in amount or significance in any individual case or in the aggregate)), and fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated 

   ##### 

  

  

financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of its operations and consolidated cash flows for

 5.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no material liabilities or obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, matured or otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet or in the related notes to consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, except liabilities and obligations (a) disclosed or provided for in Parents most recent audited consolidated balance sheets and the related audited combined statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (or disclosed in the notes thereto) or Parents most recent unaudited consolidated quarterly balance sheet and the related unaudited consolidated quarterly statements of income and cash flows for the period then ended, each included in the Parent SEC Documents publicly available prior to the Execution Date, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, since April 3, 2009, (c) contemplated by this Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (d) set forth in Section 5.7 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

   #####

any event, change, occurrence or circumstance that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the performance of
this Merger Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub.

There are no Actions pending that have a reasonable likelihood of success challenging the validity or enforceability of this Merger Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Except as set forth in Section 5.9 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no Orders of any Governmental Authority to which Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or any of their officers, directors or employees in their capacity as such are subject, in each case that has or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

  

 5.10 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. 

  

 (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with, and are not in material default under or in material violation of, any Laws applicable to Parent, its Subsidiaries, their respective properties and assets and their respective businesses, and there are no outstanding material violations of any of the above, and Parent has not received written notice asserting any such material violation.

Except as set forth in Section 5.10(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, all such Permits are in full force and effect. To Parents Knowledge, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice, warning letter, regulatory letter or similar written communication regarding any material violation of, conflict with, or the revocation, withdrawal, non-renewal, termination, cancellation or suspension of any material Permit. Parent and its Subsidiaries have been and are in material compliance with the terms of all material Permits. 

  

 (c) The Communications Permits held by Parent or its Subsidiaries (i) are validly issued, in good standing and in full force and effect (and have not been suspended, canceled, revoked or modified in any adverse manner except for any adverse modification which is immaterial), and (ii) constitute all of the Permits required by applicable Communications Laws to operate Parents business, as it is currently being conducted. Parent and its Subsidiaries have made all material filings required by Communications Laws and are in compliance in all material 

   ##### 

  

  

respects with the Communications Laws and the terms and conditions of its
Communications Permits. There is not pending or, to Parents Knowledge,
threatened before any Governmental Authority any proceeding, notice of
violation, order of forfeiture or complaint or investigation against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to any of the Communications Permits. Parent
has no reason to believe any Communications Permit will not be renewed in the
ordinary course.

 8.6 _Court Proceedings_. There shall be no Actions pending that have a reasonable likelihood of success which (i) challenge the validity or enforceability of this Merger Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) would cause any of the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be rescinded following consummation thereof, (iii) would affect adversely the right or powers of Parent to own or control the Company or its Subsidiaries or (iv) would materially adversely affect the right or powers of Parent to operate the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 (b) Each Communications Consent shall have been issued by a Final Order.

No positions that Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates may take in responding to a Challenge shall be taken into account in determining whether a Challenge has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in such a subsequent decision.

   ##### 

  

  

X. _EMPLOYMENT MATTERS; NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_  

   

 10.1 _Employment Matters_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall terminate, effective prior to the Closing Date (the "401(k) Termination Date"), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("Company 401(k) Plans") unless Parent shall provide notice to the Company that any such Company 401(k)Plan(s) shall not be terminated pursuant to this Section 10.1(a). In the event that any Company 401(k) Plan is so terminated pursuant to this Section 10.1(a), Parent shall cause the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary) to become a participating employer in Parents 401(k) plan (the "New Savings Plan") as of the Closing Date. The New Savings Plan shall (i) accept direct rollovers from any applicable Company 401(k) Plan of eligible rollover distributions (including outstanding loan balances) payable for the benefit of Company Employees who are employed by the Company as of the Closing Date, and (ii) permit new loans to participants in accordance with the terms of the New Savings Plan. During the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2010, Company Employees shall receive matching contributions into the New Savings Plan on terms and conditions at least as favorable as those offered to Parents employees. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent). 

   

 (b) During the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2010, Parent shall provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who become employees of Parent or remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date ("Company Employees") employee benefits and programs (including medical, dental and vision insurance, short and long term disability insurance, and plans under Section 125 of the Code) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits and programs provided to such employees under the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that following the Closing Date Parent shall retain the right to (i) modify the level of compensation of any Company Employee, (ii) modify vacation and other policies regarding paid time off or unpaid leaves of absence and (iii) modify or terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each Company Employee with credit for service for the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, eligibility, participation and level of benefits (but not benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) 

   ##### 

  

   

under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
in which such employee participates on or after the Closing in the same
manner as if such service had been service for Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such credit shall be required
to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period of service. 

  

 10.2 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties in this Merger Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Merger Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 10.2 shall not limit the survival of any covenant or agreement of the Parties in this Merger Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. 

  

XI. _TERMINATION_  

   

 11.1 _Termination_. This Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing, as follows: 

  

 (a) by mutual written agreement of the Parties; 

   

 (b) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall be in material violation of any of its obligations hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured within thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice by Parent or such breach is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) there shall have been any event, change, occurrence or circumstance that renders the conditions set forth in either Section 8.1 or 8.3 incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; 

   

 (c) by the Company, if (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall be in material violation of any of its obligations hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured within thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice by the Company or such breach is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) there shall have been any event, change, occurrence or circumstance that renders the conditions set forth in either Section 9.1 or 9.3 incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date; 

   

 (d) by Parent or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred by the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Execution Date (the "Initial Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate under this Section 11.1(d) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of a representation or warranty or failure to fulfill any covenant or other agreement under this Merger Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date, and _provided_ , _further_ , that if on the Initial Outside Date all the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII, Article VIII and Article IX have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) (and in the case of those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until or immediately prior to the Closing, such conditions would 

   ##### 

  

   

be satisfied if the Initial Outside Date were the Closing Date) other than the
conditions precedent set forth in Sections 7.2, 7.3 and/or 8.7, then any
Party (or, in the case of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.7,
Parent) shall be entitled to extend the Initial Outside Date by a three (3)
month period by written notice to the other Parties (the Initial Outside Date
may be so extended not more than twice), it being understood that in no event
shall the Initial Outside Date be extended to a date that is later than the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Execution Date; and 

   

 (e) an order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or injunction shall have become final and non-appealable and the Party seeking to terminate this Merger Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) shall have acted in a manner consistent with Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b) and 6.1(e). 

   

 (f) As used in this Merger Agreement, the term "Outside Date" shall mean the Initial Outside Date, unless the Initial Outside Date has been extended pursuant to Section 11.1(d), in which case, the term "Outside Date" shall mean the date to which the Initial Outside Date has been so extended. 

   

 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) If this Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1(b), 11.1(c), 11.1(d) or 11.1(e), written notice thereof shall be given by the terminating Party to the other Parties to this Merger Agreement. If this Merger Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 11.1, this Merger Agreement will have no further force and effect, except with respect to Sections 6.1(d), this Section 11.2 and Article XII which shall remain in full force and effect following termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Merger Agreement is terminated by a Party because of breach by the other Party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating Partys obligations under this Merger Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other Partys failure to comply with its obligations under this Merger Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of this Merger Agreement for any reason. 

   

 (b) In the event this Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(ii) (other than in connection with any event, change, occurrence or circumstance that results directly or indirectly from a knowing or intentional breach by the Company, or from the Companys failure to act in good faith), (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 11.1(c) or (iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 11.1(d) and, in the case of this clause (iii), at such time all the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII, Article VIII and Article IX (other than (A) the conditions set forth in Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and/or Section 8.7 and (B) the conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until or immediately preceding the Closing, but in the case of clause (B), which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the date 

   ##### 

  

   

of such termination) have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) on or prior to the date of termination, Parent shall execute
and deliver to the Company the Capacity Agreement, which shall become
effective in accordance with its terms; _provided_  that, in lieu of entering
into the Capacity Agreement, Parent may elect to pay to the Company a fee of
Twenty Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000) in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company, in either case within five (5) Business Days after delivery of a
written notice of termination pursuant to Section 11.2(a);  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that termination of this Merger Agreement under the circumstances
described in this Section 11.2(b) shall not be effective until the earlier of
(x) Parent executing and delivering to the Company the Capacity Agreement or
(y) receipt by the Company of the fee of Twenty Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000) in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds; _provided_ , _further_ , that termination of this Merger
Agreement under the circumstances described in Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall not
limit the ability of the Company to pursue all remedies that may be available
to it under Section 12.16, after taking into account the remedies provided
under this Section 11.2(b). 

   

 11.3 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No Party may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Articles VII, VIII or IX, as the case may be, to be satisfied as a basis to terminate this Merger Agreement, if such failure was caused by such Partys failure to act in good faith or use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

XII. _MISCELLANEOUS_  

   

 12.1 _Governing Law_. This Merger Agreement and any dispute, controversy or claim, whether sounding in contract or tort, arising out of or relating to this Merger Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its principles of conflict of laws that could mandate the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 

  

 12.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue_. Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court within the state of Delaware or, in the event that exclusive jurisdiction is vested with regard to any claim in the federal courts, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (any such court, a "Delaware Court"), for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Merger Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in a Delaware Court, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any such action. 

  

 12.3 _Construction; Entire Agreement; Amendment_. The captions and headings preceding the Articles and Sections in this Merger Agreement have been inserted for 

   ##### 

  

 

convenience only and shall not be given any substantive or interpretive
effect. This Merger Agreement, which includes any exhibits and schedules
hereto and other documents, agreements and instruments executed and delivered
pursuant to or in connection with this Merger Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
contained herein, and it supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
representations and understandings of the Parties, express or implied, oral
or written. This Merger Agreement may not be amended or modified in any way
except in a writing signed by each of the Parties. 

   

 12.4 _Assignment_. The rights and obligations of a Party under this Merger Agreement shall not be assignable by such Party without prior, express written consent of all other Parties, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Merger Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of their Affiliates at any time;  _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 12.5 _Binding Effect_. This Merger Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the legal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of the respective Parties.

Terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Merger Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Merger Agreement. 

  

 12.7 _Waiver_. Any provision of this Merger Agreement may be waived in writing at any time by the Party which is entitled to the benefit of such provision. Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Merger Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Merger Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 

  

 12.8 _Counterparts_. This Merger Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties to this Merger Agreement.

The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns related to such Transfer Taxes. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.10 _Severability_. The Parties agree that if any part, term, or provision of this Merger Agreement shall be found invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by any court of Law or competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall be severable, valid, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and any such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render illegal or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 12.12 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties hereto are sophisticated and have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the Parties do not intend that the presumptions of Laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to this Merger Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects. 

  

 12.13 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Merger Agreement, if the Closing occurs, each Party shall bear the Transaction Expenses as allocated to such Party pursuant to Schedule 1.2 and as otherwise incurred by such Party. If the Closing does not occur, each Party shall bear the Transaction Expenses incurred by such Party, and the allocation of such Transaction Expenses pursuant to Schedule 1.2 shall be disregarded in all respects. 

  

 12.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Section 6.3(a) of this Merger Agreement (which is intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the Persons indemnified therein, whether or not Parties hereto), this Merger Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person not a Party hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 12.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Merger Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Merger Agreement may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except to the extent a named Party to this Merger Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Merger Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any Party hereto shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party hereto under this Merger Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 

  

 12.16 _Remedies_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Merger Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.2(b), the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company shall first seek specific performance with respect to breaches by
Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this Merger Agreement if
specific performance is a remedy available to the Company with respect to
such breaches. If a court of competent jurisdiction declines to specifically
enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to a claim for
specific performance under this Section 12.16 or the remedy of specific
performance is otherwise unavailable to the Company, the Company may then
pursue any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity including
monetary damages (which the Parties agree may not be limited to reimbursement
of expenses or out-of-pocket costs and, notwithstanding Section 12.14, to the
extent proven, may be determined by reference to the amount, if any, that
would have been recoverable by the Company Stockholders if such Company
Stockholders were entitled to bring an action against Parent).
