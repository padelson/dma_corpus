Section 2.05Purchase Price.

 

(a)The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets, subject to
adjustment provided for in Section 2.05(b), shall be $400,000,000.00 (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06, the "Purchase Price"),
plus the assumption of all of the Assumed Liabilities. The Purchase Price
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds at Closing to an
account designated in writing by Seller to Buyer no later than two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b)Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of
the book value of the Adjustable Inventory (the "Estimated Adjustable
Inventory Value"), together with a report setting forth detailed supporting
calculations, in accordance with the inventory valuation principles and
methodologies set forth in Exhibit D. The Purchase Price payable at Closing
shall be (i) to the extent that the Estimated Adjustable Inventory Value is
less than $6,000,000, decreased, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount
of such shortfall, or (ii) to the extent that the Estimated Adjustable
Inventory Value is greater than $7,000,000, increased, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, by the amount of such excess.

 

Section 2.06Post-Closing Adjustment - Inventory.

 

(a)Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will (i) determine (A) the
book value of Adjustable Inventory as of the Effective Time (the "Adjustable
Inventory Value") and (B) the amount by which that determination of the
Adjustable Inventory Value is more or less than the Estimated Adjustable
Inventory Value (the difference being the "Adjustable Inventory Value
Adjustment") and (ii) deliver to Seller a report setting forth in detail the
Adjustable Inventory Value Adjustment and detailed supporting calculations in
accordance with the inventory valuation principles and methodologies set forth
in Exhibit D (the "Adjustable Inventory Value Report"). The post-Closing
determination of Adjustable Inventory Value will be based on the actual
Adjustable Inventory as of the Effective Time, determined based upon the
Estimated Adjustable Inventory Value as adjusted for purchases, production and
sales from the time the Estimated Adjustable Inventory Value was calculated
until the Effective Time and will conform in all respects to the inventory
valuation principles and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D. If the
Adjustable Inventory Value Adjustment is a positive amount, such amount will
be paid by Buyer to Seller, and if the Adjustable Inventory Value Adjustment
is a negative amount, such amount will be paid by the Seller to Buyer, each as
provided in Section 2.06(d) below.

 

(b)From and after the date upon which Seller delivers its report and
calculations pursuant to Section 2.05(b), each party, at the other party\'s
request, will make available to the other party and its agents and
Representatives the books, records and worksheets supporting, and the
personnel who prepared, any calculation or report provided for in Section 2.05
or Section 2.06. Each party will also discuss with the other party during the
time period for preparing such report, as requested by the other party, the
status of any such calculation or report, including particular adjustments
that it has identified. Seller\'s designated representative for purposes of
this Section 2.06 is John Heffernan who is currently Vice President - Business
Development, and Buyer\'s designated representative for purposes of this
Section 2.06 is Craig

The communications between such persons in connection with this Section 2.06
may be given by email, fax, registered mail, overnight courier or any other
comparable means, but any such communication will be deemed received only upon
actual receipt. Notice of any dispute that they cannot resolve and changes in
such contact person and contact information will only be made pursuant to
Section 10.02.

 

(c)If Seller does not (i) give written notice to Buyer of an objection to the
Adjustable Inventory Value Report, together with a reasonably detailed
description of any changes that Seller proposes to be made to the calculation
of Adjustable Inventory Value and detailed supporting calculations, within 30
days after Seller\'s receipt of such report, or (ii) notify Buyer at any time
within such 30-day period that Seller accepts the Adjustable Inventory Value
Report, the Adjustable Inventory Value Report will become binding in its
entirety at the end of such 30-day period. If Seller has notified Buyer that
Seller accepts the Adjustable Inventory Value Report within such 30-day
period, the Adjustable Inventory Value Report will become binding in its
entirety as of the date of such notification. If Seller objects to any part
of the Adjustable Inventory Value Report within such 30-day period, and the
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree as to all disputed parts within 30 days
after Seller\'s objection is received by Buyer, then (x) the agreed-upon parts
(if any) of the Adjustable Inventory Value Report will become binding on the
parties at the end of the 30-day period after Seller\'s objection is received
by Buyer and paid in accordance with Section 2.06(d) and (y) the disputed
parts will be resolved pursuant to the binding dispute resolution process as
provided in Section 2.06(e).

 

(d)If the Adjustable Inventory Value Report delivered to Seller has become
binding in whole and indicates that Buyer is to make a payment to Seller, then
such payment will be made within seven (7) days after the Adjustable Inventory
Value Report

 

21

   

becomes binding as provided in Section 2.06(c). If the Adjustable Inventory
Value Report as delivered to Seller has become binding in whole and indicates
that Seller is to make a payment to Buyer, then such payment will be made
within seven (7) days after the Adjustable Inventory Value Report becomes
binding as provided in Section 2.06(c). If the Adjustable Inventory Value
Report is disputed, in whole or in part, by Seller in accordance with Section
2.06(c), then (i) payment of amounts related to the undisputed parts that have
become binding will be made in accordance with the foregoing and (ii) payment
of amounts related to each disputed part will be made only when the final
Adjustable Inventory Value Adjustment is determined in accordance with Section
2.06(e). For the avoidance of doubt, any disputes with respect to the
Adjustable Inventory Value Report will defer the payment only of amounts
related to the disputed parts. All payments pursuant to this Section 2.06(d)
will be by wire transfer in accordance with the recipient\'s instructions.

 

(e)Any disputes regarding the Adjustable Inventory Value Report will be
submitted to and settled by the binding dispute resolution process set forth
in this Section 2.06(e). The dispute will be (a) submitted for resolution to
a partner in the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who has at least 10
years\' experience in resolving disputes and who is designated in writing by
another partner of the firm (the designated partner, the "Accountant"), (b)
conducted in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 2.06(e),
and (c) initiated by either Seller or Buyer sending a notice to the other
electing to resolve the dispute in accordance with this Section 2.06(e). The
Accountant will undertake to complete the dispute resolution and issue his
written report within 60 days after he receives the notice referred to above
(the "Dispute Resolution Period"). Each of Seller and Buyer will promptly
submit to the Accountant all materials requested by the Accountant, promptly
respond to questions asked by the Accountant, so that the Accountant can issue
his report on or before the end of the Dispute Resolution Period. The
Accountant may, if he or she elects, hold a one-day hearing at the
Accountant\'s offices. The Accountant (who will act as an expert and not as
an arbitrator) will undertake in good faith to issue a written report (which
will briefly summarize the reasons for the determination) by the end of the
Dispute Resolution Period. The Accountant\'s report will set forth a
determination only with respect to the disputed amounts (and for avoidance of
doubt, will not include any other finding or award), and will be based solely
on the information made available to the Accountant (to the extent the
Accountant considers appropriate) and the terms of this Agreement (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Accountant will not vary the terms of this
Agreement, but rather will strictly apply them to the dispute and without
limiting or being limited by the foregoing, will not employ any means of
calculating the components of Adjustable Inventory Value which are different
from the principles and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D, to the extent
that such means are inconsistent with or not provided for in Exhibit D). The
decision for each disputed amount must be within the range of values assigned
to each such item in the calculation of the Adjustable Inventory Value
Adjustment and value attributable thereto by Seller in its objection to the
Adjustable Inventory Value Adjustment. The decision of the Accountant will be
final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction, with payment being due from Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to
the other party within 10 days after the issuance of the decision. The
Accountant will not award costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), or
damages, interest or penalties to any party. Each of the Buyer and the Seller
will pay 50% of the Accountant\'s fees and expenses, but otherwise each party
will pay its own costs and expenses of the dispute resolution process of this
Section 2.06(e).

 

22

   

Section 2.07Allocation of the Purchase Price. Within ninety days (90) after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule allocating the
Purchase Price (including any Assumed Liabilities treated as consideration for
the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes) (the "Allocation Schedule"). The
Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code. The Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final, and shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties, unless Seller delivers to Buyer a written notice
identifying each item reflected in the Allocation Schedule to which Seller
takes exception within 30 days after delivery of the Allocation Schedule to
Seller (such items "Allocation Objections") (it being understood that any
amounts not disputed by Seller shall be final and binding). Upon delivery of
the Allocation Objections, if any, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within
60 days after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule, then Seller and Buyer
shall each be entitled to adopt their own positions regarding the allocation
of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets for applicable tax purposes.
If the parties agree on the Allocation Schedule (or such schedule is deemed
accepted), Seller and Buyer agree to file their respective IRS Forms 8594 and
all federal, state and local Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule.

 

Section 2.08Non-assignable Rights.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to
the provisions of this Section 2.08, to the extent that the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Assigned Contract or Business Permit
(i) would result in a violation of applicable Law or (ii) would require the
consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is not a party to
this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (including any
Governmental Authority), and such consent, authorization, approval or waiver
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not
constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, of such Assigned
Contract or Business Permit (each, a "Non-assignable Right"); provided,
however, that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
contained in Article VII, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the
foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.
Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain, any such required consent,
authorization, approval or waiver or (if required in order to carry out the
provisions of this Section 2.08) any release, substitution or amendment
required to novate any Non-assignable Rights so that they can effectively be
transferred to Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing
upon the terms set forth in this Agreement (without regard to the provisions
of this Section 2.08); provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall
be required to pay any consideration therefor. Once such consent,
authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment is
obtained, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer the
relevant Non-assignable Right to which such consent, authorization, approval,
waiver, release, substitution or amendment relates for no additional
consideration. Applicable Transfer Taxes in connection with such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or license shall be borne by the parties in
accordance with Section 6.11(a).

 

23

   

(b)To the extent that any Non-Assignable Right cannot be transferred to Buyer
following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.08, Buyer and Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts to implement such arrangements (such as
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) as shall be determined by the
parties in order to provide to them the economic and, to the extent permitted
under applicable Law, operational equivalent of the transfer of such Non-
assignable Right to Buyer as of the Closing and the performance by Buyer of
the Assumed Liabilities with respect thereto. Under any such arrangements,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Seller shall continue to hold legal
title to such Non-assignable Right for the exclusive benefit of Buyer and
Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor for Seller, pay, perform and discharge
fully the Assumed Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing Date. In
addition, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller shall, at
Buyer's expense, hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt
thereof, such Non-Assignable Right and all income, proceeds and other monies
received by Seller to the extent related to such Non-Assignable Right in
connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.08. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 2.08 shall not
apply to any consent or approval required under any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law, which consent or approval shall be governed by Section
6.06.

 

Section 2.09Pro Ration. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date (and, to the extent necessary, from time to time thereafter),
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement setting forth all (i) gas, heat,
water, sewage, electricity, trash removal, telephone, internet and other
utilities, (ii) rebates, discounts or allowances payable to any customer or
arising under any Sales Contracts transferred to Buyer and (iii) any ad
valorem and property Taxes, in each case relating to the Business with respect
to periods (or portions thereof) prior to the Closing which were not settled
at Closing and are to be paid by Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) to the
other party pursuant to this Section 2.09, together with reasonable supporting
documentation. The amounts referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) above
shall be apportioned between the Buyer and the Seller on a pro rata basis
based on the Closing Date and the number of days in the relevant determination
period. Each statement to be delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.09
shall also set forth a calculation of the net amount payable by the Seller to
the Buyer, or by the Buyer to the Seller, in order to give effect to such
apportionment for all amounts covered by such statement. The net amount
payable by the Buyer or the Seller, as applicable, shall be paid by the Buyer
or the Seller (as applicable) to the other party within thirty days after the
delivery of the statement referred to above.

Article IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedules, Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer that the statements contained in this Article IV are true
and correct as of the date hereof as follows:

 

Section 4.01Organization and Qualification of Seller. Seller is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the state of Delaware and has all necessary entity power and
authority to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned,
operated or leased by it and to carry on the Business as currently conducted.
Section 4.01 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth each jurisdiction
in which Seller is licensed or qualified to do business in connection with the
Business, and Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of the Purchased
Assets or the operation of the Business as currently conducted makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.02Authority of Seller. Seller has all necessary entity power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which Seller is or will be a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to which Seller is or will be a party, the performance by
Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite entity action on the part of Seller and, if
required, its equity owners. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Buyer) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). When each other Transaction Document to which
Seller is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding
obligation of Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

Section 4.03No Conflicts; Consents. The execution, delivery and performance
by Seller of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is
or will be a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, do not and will not: (a) result in a violation or breach
of any provision of the certificate of formation or operating agreement of
Seller; (b) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Seller, the Business or the
Purchased Assets; or (c) require the consent, notice or other action by any
Person under, conflict with, result in a

 

27

   

violation or breach of, constitute a default or an event that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or result
in the acceleration of or loss of rights under or create in any party the
right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel any Contract or Business
Permit to which Seller is a party or by which Seller or the Business is bound
or to which any of the Purchased Assets are subject (including any Assigned
Contract); or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on
the Purchased Assets other than a Permitted Encumbrance; except in the cases
of clauses (b) and (c), where the violation, breach, conflict, default,
acceleration or failure to give notice would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. No consent, approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or
filing or registration with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is
required by or with respect to Seller in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for
such filings as may be required under the HSR Act and as set forth in Section
4.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and such consents, approvals, Permits,
Governmental Orders, declarations, filings or notices which, if not obtained,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

Article V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Except as set forth in the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, Buyer represents and
warrants to Seller that the statements contained in this Article V are true
and correct as of the date hereof as follows:

 

Section 5.01Organization and Authority of Buyer. Buyer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state
of Delaware.

 

Section 5.02Authority of Buyer. Buyer has all necessary corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which Buyer is or will be a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to which Buyer is or will be a party, the performance by
Buyer of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of Buyer. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Seller) this Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against Buyer

 

39

   

in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). When
each other Transaction Document to which Buyer is or will be a party has been
duly executed and delivered by Buyer (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by each other party thereto), such Transaction Document will
constitute a legal and binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

Section 5.03No Conflicts; Consents. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is
or will be a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, do not and will not: (a) result in a violation or breach
of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Buyer; (b)
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law
or Governmental Order applicable to Buyer; or (c) require the consent, notice
or other action by any Person under, conflict with, result in a violation or
breach of, or constitute a default or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, any Contract to which
Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or its assets are subject, except in the
cases of clauses (b) or (c), where the violation, breach, conflict, default or
failure to give notice would not have a material effect on Buyer\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent, approval,
Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing or registration with, or
notice to, any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Buyer
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, except for such filings as may be required under the HSR
Act and such consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental Orders, declarations,
filings or notices which, if not obtained, would not individually or in the
aggregate, have a material effect on Buyer\'s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

Section 5.04Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or commission payable by Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Buyer.

 

Section 5.05Sufficiency of Funds. Buyer has available to it, and will have
available at Closing (through a combination of cash on hand and/or available
credit under its existing credit facilities), sufficient funds to enable it to
pay the Purchase Price and meet all of its financial obligations contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

 

Section 5.06Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Buyer shall be solvent and shall: (a) be able to pay its
debts as they become due; (b) own property that has a fair saleable value
greater than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities); and (c) have adequate
capital to carry on its business. No transfer of property is being made and
no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby with the

 

40

   

intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer
or Seller. In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has
not incurred, nor plans to incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they
become absolute and matured.

 

Section 5.07Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions or Claims pending or, to
Buyer\'s knowledge, threatened against or by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
that challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.08Independent Investigation. Buyer has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the Business and the
Purchased Assets, and acknowledges that it has been provided access by Seller
to the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of Seller for such purpose. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely upon
its own investigation and the express representations and warranties of Seller
set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including related portions of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules); and (b) neither Seller nor any other Person has
made any representation or warranty (i) as to Seller, the Business, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including the related
portions of the Seller Disclosure Schedules), or (ii) as to the accuracy,
completeness or other characteristics of any statement, memoranda,
projections, estimates, budgets, summaries or other information whatsoever
relating to any aspect of the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or
the Seller Facilities or its operations or of Seller that was made, provided
or otherwise made available by Seller, by any of its Affiliates, or by any
Representative of any of them (whether pursuant to offering materials, a
management presentation, a "data room," due diligence discussions, or employee
interviews or in connection with access to Seller\'s records, premises and
employees) to (or otherwise obtained by) Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any
Representative of any of them.

 

Article VI 
COVENANTS

 

Section 6.01Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. From the date hereof
until the Closing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or consented
to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), with respect to the Business and Purchased Assets, Seller shall (a)
conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
intact its current business organization and operations, and to preserve the
rights, goodwill and relationships of its Employees, customers, suppliers,
regulators and others having relationships with the Business; (c) use,
operate, maintain and repair the Seller Facilities in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice; (d) maintain the books and records of
Seller relating to the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice; (e) pay, discharge and satisfy all material Claims,
accounts payable, liabilities or obligations of Seller relating to the
Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (f)
not enter into any Contract relating to the Business with a term in excess of
thirty (30) months and providing for annual payments thereunder in excess of
$1,000,000 (a "Significant Contract"), or amend, modify or change any Material
Contract, other than entering into new Contracts (other than Significant
Contracts) with suppliers for the purchase of raw materials,

 

41

   

products and supplies and new Contracts (other than Significant Contracts)
with customers for the sale of Inventory, in each case in the ordinary course
of business; (g) not obtain any material rulings or make, change or revoke any
material elections with respect to Taxes, or enter into any material
agreements with any taxing authority related to the Business or the Purchased
Assets; or (h) not take any action which, if taken immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, would constitute or result in a breach or
violation of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section
4.05 if not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct
the Business' operations prior to Closing. Prior to Closing, Seller shall
exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision of the operations of the Business.

 

Section 6.02Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Closing,
Seller shall (a) afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to and
the right to inspect all of the Real Property, properties, assets, premises,
Books and Records, Assigned Contracts and other documents and data related to
the Business; (b) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such financial,
operating and other data and information related to the Business as Buyer or
any of its Representatives may reasonably request; and (c) instruct the
Representatives of Seller to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the
Business; provided, however, that any such investigation shall be conducted
during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, under
the supervision of Seller\'s personnel and in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business or any other
businesses of Seller. No investigation by Buyer or other information received
by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement.
All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be
submitted or directed exclusively to John Heffernan or such other individuals
as Seller may designate in writing from time to time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to
disclose any information to Buyer if it is reasonably foreseeable that such
disclosure would, in Seller's reasonable judgment: (x) cause significant
competitive harm to Seller and its businesses, including the Business, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated; (y)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege; or (z) contravene any
applicable Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Buyer shall not contact any
suppliers to, or customers of, the Business in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer shall not perform invasive or
subsurface investigations of the Real Property. Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
with respect to any access or information provided pursuant to this Section
6.02.

 

Section 6.03Notification of Certain Matters; Supplement to Seller Disclosure
Schedules. 

 

(a)Seller shall give prompt notice to the Buyer of (i) any matter hereafter
arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date of the
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which is

 

42

   

reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty of the Seller
contained in Article IV to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing,
(iii) any failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Seller hereunder, (iv) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that any consent,
approval or authorization of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) the commencement
of any Action by a Governmental Authority or other Person that could
reasonably be expected to affect the transactions contemplated hereby in any
material respect; provided, however, that any such notice shall in any event
be delivered to the Buyer no later than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. In addition, the Seller shall promptly provide written notice
to the Buyer if any Key Customer or Key Supplier or any other lessor,
licensor, licensee, distributor, contractor or other Person having a material
business relationship with Seller relating to the Business informs the Seller
or any member of the management of the Seller orally or in writing that such
Person intends to terminate or alter in any material respect such
relationship, whether as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise.

 

(b)From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedules
hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising or of which it becomes
aware after the date hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Any disclosure in
any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether or not the conditions set forth
in Section 7.02(a) have been satisfied and for purposes of the indemnification
provisions of Article VIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Seller
Disclosure Schedules are supplemented after the date hereof to reflect any
matter (A) that first arises after the date of this Agreement and, if existing
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules in order for the representations and warranties of
Seller to be true and correct and (B) that does not arise, in whole or in
substantial part, from a breach by Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, (ii) if Seller acknowledges in writing
to Buyer when such supplement or amendment is delivered to Buyer that the
matter disclosed in such supplement or amendment would cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Buyer to not be fulfilled at the Closing, and
(iii) Buyer nonetheless elects to proceed with the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then, unless otherwise agreed in writing by
the parties, such supplement or amendment shall be deemed to have qualified,
as applicable, the representations and warranties made as of the Closing Date
by Seller pursuant to Article IV for purposes of determining any
indemnification rights of Buyer under this Agreement. 

 

Section 6.04Certain Employees Matters.

 

(a)Employee Information. Seller has previously provided or made available to
Buyer, as of the date hereof, (i) a list of all Business Employees, (ii) each
Business Employee\'s rate of base salary or hourly wage compensation, total
annual compensation (including incentive and similar compensation), title, job
location, beginning service date, period of service recognized by each
Employee Plan (if applicable), vacation entitlement and target bonus
opportunity and (iii) whether a Business Employee is on active status or on
leave of absence, whether short-term, family, paternity, short-term
disability, paid, unpaid or other leave,

 

43

   

and projected return date, if any. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with written updates to such information to reflect new hires
and terminations of employment of Business Employees between the date hereof
and the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date. Following the execution
of this Agreement, Seller shall not transfer any Must-Offer Employee or May-
Offer Employee to a position unrelated to the Business.

 

(b)Offers of Employment. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall make offers of
employment in writing for employment with Buyer commencing on the applicable
Employee Transfer Date and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Section 6.04 to (i) each of the Must-Offer Employees and (ii) those May-
Offer Employees as Buyer shall deem appropriate. Following the Effective Date
and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take reasonable efforts to have
the May-Offer Employees available to interview for employment with Buyer.
Each Business Employee shall have at least five Business Days from the date of
the offer of employment to accept the offer. Seller shall not induce or
otherwise attempt to influence any such Business Employee to not accept his or
her offer of employment from Buyer. Each Business Employee who accepts
Buyer\'s offer of employment and satisfies Buyer\'s standard hiring policies
shall be hired by Buyer as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date, it being
understood that such Business Employee will thereafter become an employee of
Buyer (such Business Employees to collectively be referred to as the "Hired
Employees"). In respect of any Business Employee who is (i) absent from work
due to short or long-term disability or an authorized leave of absence and
(ii) returns to work within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date or
such later period as the Business Employee has the right to return to work
under applicable Law and satisfies Buyer\'s standard hiring policies (any such
Business Employee, a "Leave Employee"), Buyer\'s offer of employment to the
Leave Employee shall provide for employment effective as of the date on which
such Leave Employee returns to work and, if such Leave Employee accepts
Buyer\'s offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer, such Leave
Employee shall be considered a Transferred Employee under this Agreement
effective as of his or her Employee Transfer Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Employee Transfer Date" shall be (A) for Hired Employees other
than the Leave Employees, the Effective Time, and (B) for Leave Employees,
12:01 A.M. local time on the date on which such Leave Employee\'s period of
absence expires and such Leave Employee returns to active employment. Any
Business Employee that declines Buyer\'s offer of employment (or fails to
timely respond to such offer), fails to satisfy Buyer\'s standard hiring
policies, or, in the case of a Leave Employee, does not timely return from
such employee\'s absences or leave as provided above, shall not be a Hired
Employee.

 

(c)Benefits for Hired Employees. During the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the 12th full calendar month after the Closing Date, Buyer
will provide to each Hired Employee (excluding those who have quit or been
terminated) compensation and employee benefits that, with respect to each such
Hired Employee, are not less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation
and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that the compensation and benefits of the Hired
Employees who were covered by the Applicable CBA shall be as set out in either
the Applicable CBA, as assumed by Buyer or Buyer\'s Affiliate, or a collective
bargaining agreement entered into between Buyer or Buyer\'s Affiliate and
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Cement, Lime, Gypsum and Allied
Workers Division, Local Lodge D-357, as determined by Buyer ("Post-Closing
CBA"), covering such Hired Employee\'s employment until such collective

 

44

   

bargaining agreement\'s expiration, modification or termination in accordance
with its terms or applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the
vacation and other paid time off provided to each Hired Employee will include
his or her accrued but unpaid vacation and other paid time off that are
assumed by Buyer as Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.03. Following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall credit Hired Employees with their accrued but
unpaid vacation and other paid time off benefits as of the Closing Date for
use by an employee in accordance with Buyer's policies in respect thereof.

 

(d)Severance Payments. Buyer will provide each Hired Employee whose
employment is not covered by the Post-Closing CBA who incurs a termination of
employment during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
12th full calendar month after the Closing Date with severance payments and
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of (i) the
severance payments and severance benefits to which such Hired Employee would
have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance
policies of Seller as in effect immediately before the Closing Date and (ii)
the severance payments and severance benefits to which a similarly situated
employee of Buyer and its Affiliates would have been entitled with respect to
such termination under the severance policies of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 

(e)Service Credit. Buyer will give each Hired Employee full credit for such
Hired Employee\'s service with Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of the amount and level of benefits
(except for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans)
pursuant to any benefit plans made generally available to employees or
officers or any class or level of employees or officers maintained by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in which a Hired Employee participates to the same
extent recognized by Seller immediately before the Closing Date; provided,
however, that such service is not to be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service.

 

(f)Welfare Benefits. Buyer will (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to Hired Employees, their spouses and their
eligible dependents under any plan of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer that
provides health and welfare benefits in which Hired Employees, their spouses
and their eligible dependents may be eligible to participate on or after the
Closing Date, except for any limitations that were in effect with respect to
such employees as of the Closing under the analogous plan of Seller, (ii)
credit any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the
Hired Employees and their eligible dependents under the health and other plans
in which they participated immediately before the Closing Date during the
portion of the calendar year before the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate on or after
the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Hired Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after
the Closing Date, in each case to the extent such Hired Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous plan of Seller before the Closing Date.

 

45

   

(g)401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer will maintain or
designate a defined contribution plan and related trust intended to be
qualified under Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 501(a) of the Code (the "Buyer
401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the Closing, the Hired Employees cease
participation in the Seller 401(k) Plan, and commence participation in the
Buyer 401(k) Plan. Seller and Buyer will take all action necessary or
appropriate to allow Hired Employees to rollover their account balances
(excluding any outstanding loan balances) from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan in a direct rollover.

 

(h) Health and Dependent Flex Account Transfer. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Buyer will, as to the Hired Employees, have in effect flexible spending
reimbursement accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a
cafeteria plan qualified under IRC §125 and will credit such accounts with the
amount credited as of the Closing under comparable accounts maintained with
Seller from the beginning of the plan year to the Closing Date. As soon as
practical after the Closing (i) Seller will pay to Buyer in cash the amount,
if any, by which aggregate contributions made by Hired Employees to Seller\'s
flexible spending accounts for such plan year exceeded the aggregate benefits
provided to Hired Employees for such plan year as of the Closing; or (ii)
Buyer will pay to Seller in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate
benefits provided to Hired Employees under Seller\'s flexible spending
accounts exceeded the aggregate contributions made by Hired Employees for such
plan year as of the Closing Date.

 

(i)COBRA Coverage. Seller will provide for any required continuation coverage
pursuant to Section §4980B of the Code ("COBRA Coverage") with respect to any
"qualifying event" (as defined in Section §4980B(f)(i) of the Code) that
occurred before the Closing Date and Buyer will provide COBRA Coverage for the
Hired Employees and their qualified beneficiaries with respect to qualifying
events occurring on or after the Closing Date.

 

(j)Actions by Affiliates. All obligations undertaken by Buyer or Seller under
this Section 6.04 may be satisfied in whole or in part by an Affiliate of such
person.

 

(k)Cooperation; Employee and Plan Information. Seller and Buyer each will,
and each will cause its Affiliates as necessary to, cooperate (i) in carrying
out the provisions of this Section 6.04 (including working with third-party
administrators and insurance carriers and making available to the other such
records and other information as the other may reasonably request to
facilitate the determination of the period of service and salary of any Hired
Employee with Seller or an Affiliate) and (ii) in the preparation, execution
and filing of documents required by the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to this Section 6.04.

 

(l)WARN Act. Seller will be responsible for any action prior to or at Closing
and Buyer will be responsible for any action after Closing that results in a
"mass layoff" or "plant closing" under the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any similar state or local Applicable Law (collectively,
the "WARN Act"), including, in the case of any action after Closing, any such
event that is triggered in part by any "employment losses" (as defined under
the WARN Act) before the Closing Date.

 

46

   

(m)Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties do not intend for this Section 6.04
or any other term or provision of this Agreement to create any rights or
obligations as between Buyer and Seller, and no past, present, or future
employee (or their family members) of Buyer or Seller will be treated as a
third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

(n)No Amendment to Employee Plans. No provision in this Agreement shall
modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program or document unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" that other agreement,
plan, program or document. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement
brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as
an amendment to another agreement, plan, program or document, and that
provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly
designated as an amendment in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse
retroactively, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

 

(o)Annual Bonus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Seller shall pay each bonus-eligible Hired Employee a pro rata portion of such
employee's annual incentive bonus for service through the Closing Date, based
on such employee's target bonus for the year in which the Closing Date occurs,
in accordance with the Seller's applicable bonus programs.

 

Section 6.05Confidentiality. (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition,
covenants and agrees, following the Closing, to keep confidential, in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, information
provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement relating to the Excluded Assets
and Excluded Liabilities. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this
Section 6.05 shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect as to all
information provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. After the Closing,
Buyer shall promptly return to Seller all documents and information concerning
the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities furnished by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, agents, employees or Representatives (including all copies, if
any). Seller hereby acknowledges that, by reason of its ownership and
operation of the Business, it has acquired, and may acquire after the date
hereof pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions and
arrangements contemplated hereby, confidential or proprietary information
relating to the affairs, operations, assets, liabilities, personnel, results
of operations and financial condition of the Business ("Business Confidential
Information"), and that Buyer would be irreparably damaged if at any time
after the Closing any Business Confidential Information possessed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents were disclosed to or used by any Person other than Purchaser or its
Affiliates. From and after the Closing, Seller covenants and agrees that it
shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, and that it shall use
reasonable efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents not to, use or disclose any such Business
Confidential Information without the prior written consent of Buyer, except in
the performance of the terms of Transaction Documents, in the enforcement of
its rights under the Transaction Documents or with the prior written consent
of Buyer. 

 

(b)For purposes of this Agreement, Business Confidential Information shall
not include any information that Seller can demonstrate is or becomes publicly
available through

 

47

   

no wrongful act or breach of obligation of confidentiality by Seller. In the
event that the Seller or any of its Representatives is required by Law or
Governmental Order to produce any Business Confidential Information or any
other information concerning the Business, such production shall not be a
violation of this Agreement and Seller and its Representatives shall, to the
extent legally permissible, (i) notify Buyer in writing as soon as practicable
to permit Buyer a reasonable amount of time to seek an appropriate protective
order or other remedy (in which case Seller will cooperate with Buyer, at
Buyer's cost, to the extent as Buyer may reasonably request), (ii) cooperate
with Buyer, at Buyer's cost, to preserve the confidentiality of such Business
Confidential Information consistent with applicable Law, and (iii) use its
reasonable efforts to limit any such disclosure to the minimum disclosure
necessary to comply with such Law or Governmental Order. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreement with Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, in respect of any
Business Confidential Information shall terminate as of the Closing and cease
to be of any further force or effect.

 

Section 6.06Governmental Approvals and Consents; Consent Decree.

 

(a)Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully take any action
that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of
any required consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by
the HSR Act and if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been
filed prior to the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties, and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act.

 

(b)Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings pursuant to
this Section 6.06, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to (i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority
regarding antitrust or other matters with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; (ii) avoid
the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would restrain,
alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other

permitted by Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall

whether relating to the operation of the Business prior to or after the
Closing. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the

or violate or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement.

party hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are
necessary to expeditiously satisfy the Closing conditions set forth in Article
VII hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees to cooperate in
good faith to agree upon and finalize Exhibit G hereto, which sets forth the
scope of transition services to be provided under the Transition Services
Agreement and shall be Exhibit A to the Transition Services Agreement,
promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement; provided,
however, that such agreement shall be a condition to Closing so long as the
scope of services requested by Buyer to be included in the Transition Services
Agreement does not vary from the scope of services set forth on Exhibit G
hereto and the fees for such services are the full actual costs of the
applicable service provider.

 

Section 6.09Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of counsel),
each of the parties hereto will cooperate with each other in the development
and distribution of all news releases and other public information disclosures
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, and no party hereto shall make
any such news release or public disclosure without having complied with its
obligations under this Section 6.09.

 

Section 6.10Bulk Sales Laws. Without admitting the applicability of the bulk

file

 

50

   

any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and
Seller shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary), unless otherwise

Section 6.12Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

 

Section 6.13Accounts Receivable; Receipts and Disbursements; Mail. In the
event that Buyer receives any payments after the Closing relating to any
accounts receivable, including intracompany receivables, that accrued prior to
Closing, such payments shall be the property of, and shall be forwarded and
remitted to Seller on a bi-monthly basis. If Buyer receives any mail or other
communication that does not relate to (i) Buyer\'s active vendors or suppliers
for the Purchased Assets or the Business or (ii) the Purchased Assets or post-
Closing aspects of the Business, then Buyer shall forward it to Seller within
five (5) business days after receipt. In the event that Seller receives any
payments after the Closing relating to any accounts receivable or other
amounts that accrued on or following the Closing, such payments shall be the
property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to Buyer on a bi-monthly

Purchased Assets or post-Closing aspects of the Business, then Seller shall
undertake to forward it to Buyer within five (5) business days after receipt.

 

Section 6.14Intracompany Arrangements. Notwithstanding any other provision

provided by Seller or its Affiliates that existed pre-Closing for the benefit

pre-Closing for the benefit of the Seller or such Affiliates shall cease,
other than the services, arrangements and commitments provided for in the
Transition Services Agreement.

 

Section 6.15Retained Names; Transition Marks. (a) To the extent any of the
Retained Names appear on any plants, buildings, signs, equipment or other
structures that constitute Purchased Assets, Buyer shall, within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Closing Date, remove or obliterate, or cause to be
removed or obliterated, the Retained Names from such plants, buildings, signs,
equipment or other structures (including on uniforms and motor vehicles).
Seller may remove, or cause to be removed, from the Real Property on or prior
to the Closing all stationery, business forms, packaging, containers and other
similar personal property on which any of the Retained Names appear; provided,
however, to the extent any such items are inadvertently left on the Real
Property, Buyer shall not use any such items without first removing or
obliterating, or causing to be removed or obliterated, the Retained Names from
such materials. Buyer will not use any vehicles with any Retained Name or
related signage outside the Seller Facilities (whether to deliver product or
otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in this Section
6.15, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights to, and
shall not use in any manner, the Retained Names on or after the Closing.

 

51

   

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 6.15, Seller, shall
cause Buyer to be granted a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-
exclusive, royalty-free license, (i) with respect to the "CEMEX" trademark,
for the six (6) month period following the Closing Date and (ii) with respect
to the "RICHMORTAR", "RICHCOLOR" and "STONESET" trademarks (together with the
"CEMEX" trademark, the "Transition Marks"), for a period of nine (9) months
following the Closing Date (such nine (9) month period, or six (6) month
period, as applicable, the "Applicable Transition Period") solely for use on
cement bags in the manner that such Transition Marks were set forth on cement
bags contained in the Purchased Assets at Closing. Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to transition from use of the Transition Marks
as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to expiration of the
Applicable Transition Period.

 



 

(c)In no event will Buyer use any of the Transition Marks that are subject to
the license under this Section 6.15 after the Closing in any manner or for any
purpose other than in the same manner that such Transition Marks were being
used by the Business during the twelve (12) month period preceding the
Closing. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, all
products sold by the Business using any Transition Mark will be consistent in
nature and quality with such products as sold by the Business in the twelve
(12) month period preceding Closing. 

 



 

Section 6.16Release of Seller Performance Support. Buyer shall, at its sole
cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts (and Seller will
cooperate, at its sole cost and expense, as reasonably requested by Buyer and
without charge) to (a) obtain with respect to all Performance Bonds and
similar instruments issued with respect to Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with the Business new performance bonds or other security with
respect to Buyer\'s acts or omissions on or after the Closing Date that are
satisfactory to the beneficiary; and (b) cause Seller and each of its
Affiliates to be released from post-Closing liabilities and obligations under
all of the Performance Bonds and similar instruments issued with respect to
Seller and its Affiliates and under any guarantees and similar instruments
entered into in connection with them (collectively with the Performance Bonds
and similar instruments referred to in clause (b) above, the "Seller
Performance Support"). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer will make
commercially reasonable financial accommodation, provide such security
reasonably required by the issuer, and agree to any additional reasonable
requirements of the issuer as a condition to obtaining such replacement and
release of Seller Performance Support. Buyer will pay and otherwise be
responsible for any Losses in respect of post-Closing liabilities incurred or
suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of any Seller
Performance Support not having been replaced and released as set forth above.
For avoidance of doubt, Buyer\'s failure to comply with this Section 6.16
shall constitute a breach of a covenant for which Buyer will indemnify Seller
in accordance with Article VIII.

 

Section 6.17Casualty Loss. (a) If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, any improvements on any Real Property or Tangible Personal Property
included in the Purchased Assets (other than Adjustable Inventory) is
destroyed or damaged in whole or in part by fire, earthquake, flood, or other
casualty (a "Casualty Loss"), Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer thereof,
and Seller and Buyer shall promptly jointly engage and retain an independent
insurance adjuster (the "Insurance Adjuster") to assess the extent of the
Casualty Loss and promptly deliver a report (the "Casualty Loss Report") to
each of Seller and Buyer with its

 

52

   

determination of the cost to repair and replace the Purchased Asset in
accordance with industry practice (such amount, the "Casualty Amount"). 

 

(b) If the Casualty Amount is determined by the Insurance Adjuster not to be
in excess of $30,000,000, then Seller shall, at its option, either (i) expend
an amount not in excess of the Casualty Amount to effect the repair of such
damage or destruction (which repair may be completed following the Closing),
or (ii) pay Buyer an amount in cash not greater than the Casualty Amount to
effect the repair of such damage or destruction. 

 

(c) If the Casualty Loss is determined by the Insurance Adjuster to exceed
$30,000,000, then, unless within thirty (30) Business Days following the
receipt by Seller of the Casualty Loss Report ("Election Period") Seller
agrees to either (i) expend an amount not in excess of the Casualty Amount to
effect the repair of such damage or destruction (which repair may be completed
following the Closing) or (ii) pay Buyer an amount in cash not greater than
the Casualty Amount to effect the repair of such damage or destruction, Buyer
shall have the right to terminate the Agreement during the ten (10) Business
Day period following the end of the Election Period by providing written
notice to the Seller thereof. 

 

Section 6.18Title and Survey.

 



 

(a)Identified Parcels. With respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property set
forth on Section 6.18 of the Seller Disclosures Schedules ("Identified
Parcels"), promptly after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall obtain and
provide to Buyer (i) from a surveyor reasonably acceptable to Buyer, an
ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey (which survey shall depict any improvements,
easements, rights-of-way, encroachments and any other plottable matters
affecting the real property depicted thereon) (each an "Identified Parcel Alta
Survey"); and (ii) from First American Title Insurance Company ("Title
Agent"), title insurance commitments for the issuance of Owner\'s Title
Insurance Policies on each Identified Parcel naming Buyer as the proposed
insured together with copies of all exception documents referenced therein
(each an "Identified Parcel Title Commitment"). Buyer shall have fifteen (15)
days from receipt of an Identified Parcel Title Commitment to examine same.
Buyer shall, on or before the end of said fifteen (15) day review period,
notify Seller in writing of the title exceptions listed in the Identified
Parcel Title Commitment to which it objects, which shall not include Permitted
Encumbrances ("Noted Exceptions"). Seller shall inform Buyer prior to Closing
whether Seller will cure such Noted Exceptions or obtain an endorsement for
additional title insurance or indemnification that satisfies such objection.
Notwithstanding Buyer's fifteen (15) day review period, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller if Buyer determines that it has no objections to any Identified
Parcel Title Commitment. If Buyer does not provide notice of objections to
Seller as set forth above, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
remaining uncured objections and accepted the Identified Parcel Title
Commitment; provided that Buyer shall be deemed to have objected to, and the
same shall be deemed Noted Exceptions, any monetary encumbrances. With
respect to any Ohio standard title exceptions, Seller agrees to (i) provide a
customary owner's affidavit required by the Title Agent to, in conjunction
with the delivery of the Identified Parcel Alta Survey, provide for so-called
"extended coverage", and (ii) cause the Title Agent to perform such searches
as may be necessary to remove any exception related to the ownership of
mineral rights being vested in any Person other than Seller.

 

53

   

(b)Non-Identified Parcels. With respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property
not set forth on Section 6.18 of the Seller Disclosures Schedules ("Non-
Identified Parcels"), promptly following the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall obtain (i) from a surveyor reasonably acceptable to Buyer, a metes and
bounds survey (each a "Metes and Bounds Survey"); and (ii) from the Title
Agent, title insurance commitments for the issuance of Owner\'s Title
Insurance Policies on each Non-Identified Parcel naming Buyer as the proposed
insured together with copies of all exception documents referenced therein
(each a "Non-Identified Parcel Title Commitment"). Following Closing, Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller to obtain an ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey for each
Non-Identified Parcel (each a "Non-Identified Parcel Alta Survey") together
with an updated Non-Identified Parcel Title Commitment (each an "Updated Non-
Identified Parcel Title Commitment"). Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days from
receipt of an Updated Non-Identified Parcel Title Commitment to examine same.
Buyer shall, on or before the end of said fifteen (15) day review period,
notify Seller in writing of the title exceptions listed in the Updated Non-
Identified Parcel Title Commitment to which it objects which shall not include
Permitted Encumbrances ("NI Noted Exceptions"). Seller shall inform Buyer
within fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice if Seller will cure such
NI Noted Exceptions or obtain an endorsement for additional title insurance or
indemnification that satisfies such NI Noted Exception. Notwithstanding
Buyer's fifteen (15) day review period, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller if
Buyer determines that it has no objections to any Updated Non-Identified
Parcel Title Commitment. If Buyer does not provide notice of objections to
Seller as set forth above, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
remaining uncured objections and accepted the Non-Identified Parcel Title
Commitment; provided that Buyer shall be deemed to have objected to, and the
same shall be deemed NI Noted Exceptions, any monetary encumbrances and any
exceptions to Seller's sole ownership of fee title to the entire estate. With
respect to any Ohio standard exceptions, Seller agrees to provide a customary
owner's affidavit required by the Title Agent to, in conjunction with the
delivery of the Non-Identified Parcel Alta Survey, provide for so-called
"extended coverage". Within 15 days of receipt of all Non-Identified Parcel
Alta Surveys together with Updated Non-Identified Parcel Title Commitments for
all of the Non-Identified Parcel Title Commitments, Buyer and Seller shall
cause the Title Agent to issue Non-Identified Parcel title policies for each
Non-Identified Parcel (which may be in the form of a binding obligation from
Title Agent to issue such policy in the form of a mark-up of the Non-
Identified Parcel Title Commitment) in accordance with the Non-Identified
Parcel Title Commitment insuring Buyer's fee simple title to the Non-
Identified Parcels as of the date of such policy and subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances and the Ohio standard title exceptions for mineral rights and
items deemed accepted by Buyer, in such amounts as Seller and Buyer reasonably
determine to be the value of the real property insured thereunder.

 



 

(c)Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove all Noted
Objections and NI Noted Objections. However, if any Noted Objections or NI
Noted Objections cannot be removed, and the failure to remove the same does
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect, such failure shall not be deemed to
have a Material Adverse Effect that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(d) not to be satisfied. The parties agree that the fact that the
Closing takes place without any Noted Objections or NI Noted Objections being
removed shall not impair or otherwise affect the rights to indemnification
under Section 8.02 in respect of any Losses incurred by Buyer resulting from
such title defect.

 

54

   

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all Noted Exceptions and NI Noted
Exceptions which have not been removed, insured by endorsement, or deemed
accepted by Buyer, when taken as a whole, would result in a Material Adverse
Effect, the condition set forth in Section 7.02(d) shall be deemed not to have
been satisfied.

 

Section 6.19Financial Statements; Cooperation with Auditor. Commencing
promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to prepare and provide to Buyer no later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date, in cooperation with Buyer and KPMG LLP (the "Auditor"), the

with United States generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and

operations, and statements of revenue and expenses, general ledgers, balance
sheets and statements of cash flow and such other financial information as
reasonably requested by Buyer or the Auditor. Buyer shall bear and be
responsible for the payment of the fees and expenses of KPMG LLP in connection
with the audit of the Annual Financial Statements.

 

Section 6.20Transfer of Leased Employee Vehicles. Section 6.20 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules lists each car and truck that is used in the Business by
Employees and leased by the Seller as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Employee Vehicles"). At or prior to the Closing, the parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) establish, in the Buyer\'s name, new leases (on
terms reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) between the Buyer and the
applicable lessor of each Employee Vehicle required to be listed in Section
6.20 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, and (ii) transfer and deliver such
leased Employee Vehicles to the Buyer. If the Buyer does not enter into a new
lease in the Buyer\'s name with respect to each Employee

 

55

   

Vehicle at or prior to the Closing, then the Buyer may, at its option, with
respect to each Employee Vehicle not subject to a new lease in the Buyer\'s
name, (A) purchase such Employee Vehicle according to the terms required by
the lease between the Seller and such lessor, or (B) implement any other
reasonable arrangement acceptable to the Seller.

all such Environmental Permits or other Permits from the Seller to the Buyer.
Any fees of any Governmental Authority imposed with respect to the assignment,
transfer, amendment, or reissuance of such Environmental Permits or other
Permits shall be paid by the Buyer.

 

Section 6.22Transferred Agricultural Parcels. For three (3) years following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each parcel of Owned Real Property set

Agricultural Parcels") to continue to meet the requirements to remain in the
Ohio Current Agricultural Use Value Program ("CAUV Program").

(a)any failure of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (other than those made on a specified date, which shall be
true and correct as of such specified date); provided, however, that all
Materiality Qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty
shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred
and the amount of Losses resulting therefrom;

 

(b)any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any instrument delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to
this Agreement;

 

(c)any Excluded Asset or any Excluded Liability; or

 

(d)without duplication, Excluded Taxes ("Indemnified Taxes").

 

58

   

Section 8.03Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, Buyer shall indemnify each of Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and against,
and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees based upon or arising
out of:

 

(a)any failure of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (other than those made on a specified date, which shall be
true and correct as of such specified date); provided, however, that all
Materiality Qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty
shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred
and the amount of Losses resulting therefrom;

 

(b)any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any instrument delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement; or

 

(c)any Assumed Liability.

 

Section 8.04Certain Limitations. The party making a claim under this Article
VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against whom
such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". The indemnification provided for in Section 8.02 and
Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

(a)Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) (other than with respect to breaches of any Fundamental
Representation or Tax Representation) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $4,000,000.00 (the
"Deductible"), in which event Seller shall only be required to pay or be
liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible. With respect to any claim as to
which the Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification under Section
8.02(a), Seller shall not be liable for any individual or series of related
Losses (other than with respect to breaches of any Fundamental Representation
or Tax Representation) which do not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).
With respect to any claim as to which the Seller Indemnitees may be entitled
to indemnification under Section 8.03(a), Buyer shall not be liable for any
individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000).

 

(b)The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable
pursuant to Section 8.02(a) (other than with respect to breaches of any
Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation) shall not exceed
$30,000,000.00. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in
no event shall either Indemnifying Party\'s aggregate liability pursuant to
Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.03(a), respectively, exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(c)Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03
in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or

 

59

   

other similar payment from a third party that has actually been received by
the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, net of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking recovery from the insurer or
other third party from whom it is or may be entitled to receive such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or other similar payment. If the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith that it is likely to be entitled to
recover all or a portion of such Loss from any such insurer or other third
party, it shall submit a claim to such insurer or other third party and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery of the applicable
portion of such Loss from such insurer or other third party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to commence any
Action to enforce its rights against such insurer or other third party unless
it elects to do so in its sole discretion; provided, further, however, that
any such insurance or other third party proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such Loss after payment by an Indemnifying
Party shall be promptly refunded to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d)Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03
in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax benefit
realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party; provided that any
such benefit realized within two (2) years after payment by an Indemnifying
Party shall be promptly refunded to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(e)Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps required by applicable Law to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that it determines is reasonably likely to
give rise thereto.

 

(f)Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that the limitations
provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above apply only to Losses arising from
a breach of the representations and warranties specified therein, and do not
apply to any other rights to indemnification provided for in this Article
VIII, including rights to indemnification against Excluded Liabilities or
Assumed Liabilities (as the case may be).

 

Section 8.05Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a)Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The failure
to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third
Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of any written notice
of assertion or commencement thereof received by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense and with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
in good faith in such defense; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the

 

60

   

right to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (1) in the reasonable
judgment of the Indemnified Party, there exists a material conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim or there are any material defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that differ from or are in addition to those available to
the Indemnified Party or (2) the Third Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to result in an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party that, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party,
would be expected to materially and adversely affect the business activities
or operations of the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section
8.05(b), it shall conduct the defense diligently and in a reasonable manner
and, in doing so, shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim assumed by the
Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying
Party\'s right to conduct the defense thereof in accordance with the terms of
this Section 8.05(a). If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party
in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails
to diligently conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), conduct, control, pay, compromise,
defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses
based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection
with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject
to the provisions of Section 6.05) records relating to such Third Party Claim
and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-
pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b)Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless the
terms of such settlement include the grant by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a full and unconditional release from any and all
liability in respect thereof. If the Indemnified Party is conducting its own
defense pursuant to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(c)Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include reasonable supporting documentation and shall indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
During such 60-day period, the Indemnified Party shall provide the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors reasonable

 

61

   

information, together with such access to the Indemnified Party's premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records, as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request to substantiate the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such 60-day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(d)Reliance. The rights of the Buyer Indemnitees to indemnification for
breaches of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this
Agreement are part of the basis of the bargain contemplated by this Agreement,
and such rights to indemnification shall not be affected or waived by virtue
of, and Buyer Indemnitees shall be deemed to have relied upon the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement
notwithstanding any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Buyer Indemnitee of any untruth of any such representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in this Agreement, regardless of whether such knowledge was
obtained (or was capable of being obtained) through the investigation by such
Buyer Indemnitee or through disclosure by Seller or any other Person, and
regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained before, at or after the
Closing.

 

Section 8.06Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement and all post-Closing adjustments made
pursuant to Section 2.06 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 8.07Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.11, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising
from fraud on the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims
arising from fraud on the part of a party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have
against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII.
Nothing in this Section 8.07 shall limit any Person\'s right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to
Section 10.11 or to seek or obtain any remedy on account of any party\'s
fraud.

"include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) terms
defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the
plural, and vice versa; and (d) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"

context otherwise requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections,
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an
agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the

statute as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation
thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be
construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Exceptions to a
party\'s representations and warranties set forth herein that are disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedules shall relate and apply only to representations and

 

65

   

warranties that correspond to the numbered section or subjection thereof;
provided, however, that information set forth in one section or subsection of
the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to apply to each other section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules to which its relevance is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

Section 10.04Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.05Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in

provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.06Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents constitute the sole and entire agreement
of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter contained
herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
representations, warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the

Section 10.07Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including its right to acquire any Purchased Assets) to one or more
of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries; provided, further, that
following the Closing, Seller may assign its rights hereunder, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer, to an Affiliate of Seller or a third party
acquirer of all or substantially all of Seller\'s equity or assets. No
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder.

assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer

party hereto.

 

66

   

No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective
unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No
waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of
any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written
waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring
before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power
or privilege.

 

Section 10.10Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other
jurisdiction), except to the extent that mandatory principles of conflicts of
law require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction wherein any of
the Purchased Assets are located to determine the validity or effect of the
sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment and delivery thereof in accordance with
Article II.

 

(b)ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS AND COUNTY OF HARRIS, AND
EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN
ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR
OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY\'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE
EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT
IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY
OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH
COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT
THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D)

 

67

   

SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 10.10(c).

 

Section 10.11Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that, in view of
the uniqueness of the Business and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer would not have an adequate remedy at law
for money damages in the event that this Agreement has not been performed in
accordance with its terms, and therefore agrees that, in addition to all other
remedies available at law or in equity, the other party shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other (as applicable), and this right shall include the
right of Seller to cause Buyer to draw upon its credit facility and cause the
Purchase Price to be fully paid if the conditions set forth in Section 7.01
and 7.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived. Each of Seller and Buyer
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 

Section 10.12Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy
of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.13Non-recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly
named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations
set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their successors or
permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim, action, suit or
other legal proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

68

   

Section 10.14LIMITATION ON CERTAIN DAMAGES. 

 

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY (I) PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES OR (II) INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES,
INCLUDING LOSS OF FUTURE PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR OPPORTUNITY
RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, UNLESS UNDER
APPLICABLE CONTRACT LAW PRINCIPLES SUCH LOSSES WERE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE
CONSEQUENCE OF THE BREACH OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE SAME; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY LOSSES INCURRED BY
OR IMPOSED UPON AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN RESPECT OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR
WHICH ANY PARTY IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT.
