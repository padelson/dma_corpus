AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of May
4, 2003 by and among Zoran Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Zoran_ "),
Zinc Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran (" _Sub_ "), and Oak Technology, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Oak_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

A. The Boards of Directors of Zoran, Sub and Oak deem it advisable and in the
best interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders that Zoran
and Oak combine in order to advance the long-term business interests of Zoran
and Oak;

  



  

B. The combination of Zoran and Oak shall be effected by the terms of this
Agreement through a transaction in which Oak will merge with and into Sub
(the " _Merger_ ");

  



  

C. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Zorans willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of Oak have entered into Voting Agreements in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ pursuant to which they have agreed
to vote their shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger (the
" _Oak Voting Agreements_ ");

  



  

D. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Oaks willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of Zoran have entered into Voting Agreements
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ pursuant to which they have
agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption and approval of the
Merger (the " _Zoran Voting Agreements_ "); and

  



  

E. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
below, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# ARTICLE I

  

# 

  

# THE MERGER

  

# 

  

## Section 1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in
such form as is required by the relevant provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") shall be duly prepared, executed and
acknowledged by the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.3) and
thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for
filing, as provided in the DGCL, as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.2). The

  

## 

  

1      
   



  

## Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Effective Time_
").

  

## 

  

## Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 1:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on a date to be specified by Zoran and
Oak, which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction
of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(b)
(other than the delivery of the officers certificate referred to therein)
and 7.3(b) (other than the delivery of the officers certificate referred to
therein), provided that the other closing conditions set forth in Article VII
have been met or waived as provided in Article VII at or prior to the Closing
(the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Gray Cary Ware and Freidenrich LLP,
400 Hamilton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301-1825, unless another date or place
is agreed to in writing by Zoran and Oak.

  

## 

  

## Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.

  

## 

  

### (a) At the Effective Time (i) Oak shall be merged with and into Sub, the
separate existence of Oak shall cease and Sub shall continue as the surviving
corporation (Sub and Oak are sometimes referred to below as the "
_Constituent Corporations_ " and Sub is sometimes referred to below as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in its
entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto and, as so amended,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation, and (iii)
the Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) At and after the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be
as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Oak and Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Oak
and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

### 

  

## Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each of whom will hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed.

  

## 

  

# ARTICLE II

  

# 

  

# CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

# 

  

## Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value, of Oak (" _Oak Common Stock_ ") or
capital stock of Sub:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Zoran-Owned Stock_.  Any shares
of Oak Common Stock that are owned by Oak as treasury stock and any shares of
Oak Common

  



  

2      
   



  

### Stock that are owned by Zoran, Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary
(as defined in Section 9.3) of Zoran shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no stock of Zoran or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value,
of Zoran (" _Zoran Common Stock_ ") owned by Oak shall remain unaffected by
the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Conversion of Oak Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each
issued and outstanding share of Oak Common Stock (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, as defined
in Section 2.3) shall be converted into the right to receive:

  

### 

  

#### (i) 0.2323 of a share of Zoran Common Stock (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ "); and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) cash in an amount equal to $1.78 (the " _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ");

  

#### 

  

The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration are
referred to, collectively, as the " _Merger Consideration_."  The Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect any stock split,
stock dividend or similar transaction effected between the date hereof and
the Effective Time. All such shares of Oak Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Zoran Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

  



  

### (c) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of the common
stock, $.001 par value, of Sub (" _Sub Common Stock_ ") shall remain a share
of Sub Common Stock and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Oak Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.  At the
Effective Time, all then outstanding options to purchase Oak Common Stock
(each an " _Oak Option_ ") issued under Oaks 1988 Stock Option Plan, as
amended, 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended, Amended and Restated
1994 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, Executive Stock Option Plan and the
2002 Stock Option Plan for the Teralogic Group (collectively, the " _Oak
Option Plans_ "), not exercised as of the Effective Time will be assumed by
Zoran in accordance with Section 6.13. On or before the last trading day
prior to the Effective Time, all then outstanding rights to acquire shares of
Oak Common Stock under Oaks Amended and Restated 1994 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Oak Purchase Plan_ ") will be exercised for
the purchase of shares of Oak Common Stock, as provided in Section 6.13.

  

### 

  

## Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Oak Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant
to the Merger are as follows:

  

## 

  

3      
   



  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Zoran shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Zoran (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Oak Common
Stock, for exchange for their shares of Oak Common Stock in accordance with
this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates
evidencing the shares of Zoran Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(i), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii), and (iii) cash in
an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Oak Common Stock (each a "
_Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Zoran and Oak may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Zoran, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Zoran Common Stock to which the holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(b)(i), (B) the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration to which
the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii), and (C) cash (without
interest) in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.2(f). The
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Oak Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Oak, cash and a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Zoran Common Stock to which the registered holder is
entitled may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Oak Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender cash and the certificate representing shares of Zoran Common
Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Zoran Common Stock as
contemplated by this Section 2.2).

  

### 

  

### (c) _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. The instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken
by the holder of any Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen. It
shall be a condition to the right of such holder to receive cash and a
certificate representing shares of Zoran Common Stock as set forth in Section
2.2(B) that the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the letter of
transmittal, a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including an
agreement to indemnify Zoran, signed exactly as the name or names of the
registered holder or holders appeared on the books of Zoran immediately prior
to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond and such other
documents as Zoran or the Exchange Agent may reasonably require in connection
therewith.

  

### 

  

### 4      
   

### 

  

### (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to Zoran Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Zoran Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection
(f) of this Section 2.2 until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Zoran Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Zoran Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection
(f) below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole
shares of Zoran Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Zoran Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Oak Common Stock_. The cash and
shares of Zoran Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares
of Oak Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid pursuant to subsection (d) or (f) of this Section 2.2) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Oak Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Oak
on such shares of Oak Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Oak
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.2.

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Zoran Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Zoran. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Oak Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Zoran Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Zoran Common Stock multiplied by the last
reported sale prices of Zoran Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market, on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of
the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Oak one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Zoran, upon demand, and any
stockholders of Oak who have not previously complied with this Section 2.2
shall thereafter look only to Zoran for payment of their claim for

  

### 

  

### 5      
   

### 

  

### Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Zoran Common Stock), and any dividends or distributions with respect to Zoran
Common Stock.

  

### 

  

### (h) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
neither Zoran nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Oak Common Stock or Zoran Common Stock, as the case may be, for
Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

## Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Oak Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has complied
with the relevant provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b) and instead
such holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or loses such holders right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder would
have been entitled but for the prior status of such shares as Dissenting
Shares, without interest or dividends thereon, upon the surrender in the
manner provided in Section 2.2 of the Certificate(s) which formerly
represented such shares. Oak shall give Zoran prompt written notice of any
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
Oak relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and, prior to the Effective
Time, Zoran shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Oak shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Zoran, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  

## 

  

## Section 2.4 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(G) and 1.368-3(a).

effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger Consideration to be
issued to the holders of Oak Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is fair to
Zoran from a financial point of view, and such opinion has not been withdrawn
or modified by Merrill Lynch. A complete and correct copy of such opinion has
been delivered to Oak. Merrill Lynch has agreed that if reference to such
opinion is required by law or regulation to be made in the Registration
Statement and Joint Proxy Statement, it will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to the inclusion of such opinion, so long as the full text of such
opinion is reproduced therein and it approves in advance the text of any
accompanying disclosure.

order or ruling has become final and non-appealable, and (iii) diligently
oppose any objections to, appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen
any Approval or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this

hold separate any Subsidiary, division or business unit which is material to
the business of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the

Material Adverse Effect on such party or a material adverse effect on the
benefits intended to be derived as a result of the Merger.

  

## 

  

## Section 6.9 _Public Disclosure_. Zoran and Oak shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public

## 

  

42      
   



  

## person who is an "affiliate" of Zoran or Oak within the meaning of Rule
145 is referred to herein as an " _Affiliate_." Zoran and Oak shall provide
each other such information and documents as Oak or Zoran shall reasonably
request for purposes of reviewing such list and shall notify the other party
in writing regarding any change in the identity of its Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date.  Oak shall use its best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Zoran at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date from each of
the Affiliates of Oak, an executed agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Zoran and Oak, by which such Affiliate of Oak
agrees to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 145 (" _Affiliate
Agreements_ "). Zoran shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing any Zoran Common Stock to be received by such
Affiliates of Oak pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to

## 

  

## Section 6.13 _Stock Plans, Options, Other Incentive Awards_ .

  

## 

  

### (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Oak Option, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Zoran and shall be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Oak Option, a number of shares of Zoran Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Oak Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Oak Option (without regard to
vesting) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) a number equal to
the sum of (1) the Per Share Stock Consideration and (2) an amount equal to
the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by the closing sale price of a share
of Zoran Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of this
Agreement, at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to (i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Oak Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Oak Option (without regard to vesting)
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (ii) the number of full
shares of Zoran Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Oak Option
in accordance with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of any Oak Options to which Section 422 of the Code applies ("incentive
stock options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be calculated differently, if necessary, in order to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) In connection with the Merger, Zoran agrees, including for purposes
of Section 5.1, that Oak may commence and complete, prior to the Effective
Time, a Stock Option Exchange Program substantially in the manner described
in Proposal 4 set forth in the Proxy Statement filed by Oak with the SEC in
connection with the annual meeting of the stockholders of Oak held on
December 18, 2002 (the " _Exchange Program_ "), provided that the date on
which new options shall be granted pursuant to the Exchange Program shall not
be a date which is at least six months and one day after the date of
cancellation of options tendered for exchange as contemplated by the Exchange
Program, but rather shall be a date occurring prior to the Closing

  

### 

  

### 43      
   

### 

  

### Date, and provided further that recognition of such vesting shall
commence on the date of grant of such option rather than on the date six
months following such grant.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event that Oak determines, for any reason, that it will not
complete the Exchange Program prior to the Closing Date, then the assumption
of Oak Options by Zoran pursuant to Section 6.13(a) shall apply only to those
Oak Options outstanding at the Effective Time having an exercise price that
is equal to or less than the closing sale price of a share of Oak Common
Stock on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time, and any Oak
Options outstanding and held by Oak employees, including Oak officers, at the
Effective Time having an exercise price that is greater than the closing sale
price of a share of Oak Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the
Effective Time (each, an " _Underwater Oak Option_ ") shall not be assumed by
Zoran but shall instead terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of
the Effective Time in accordance with their terms. In such event,
Zoran, shall grant immediately following the Effective Time to each holder of
an Underwater Oak Option who remains an employee of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time a nonstatutory stock
option to purchase a number of shares of Zoran Common Stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Oak Common Stock subject to the
outstanding Underwater Oak Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the applicable exchange ratio determined in accordance with the Exchange
Program and by further multiplying such product by an exchange ratio
determined in accordance with Section 6.13(a). The exercise price per share
of each such newly granted option shall be an amount equal to the closing
sale price of a share of Zoran Common Stock on the Closing Date. Each such
option shall vest and become exercisable on the same basis as would have
applied had such option been granted as a new option pursuant to the Exchange
Program. Except as otherwise provided herein, each new option granted by
Zoran with respect to an Underwater Oak Option shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Zoran stock option plan pursuant to which it is granted
and the standard form of stock option agreement used in connection with such
plan.

  

### 

  

### (d) In the event that Oak completes the Exchange Program prior to the
Closing Date, Underwater Oak Options held by current Oak officers (who are
ineligible to participate in the Exchange Program) shall nevertheless not be
assumed by Zoran, but shall terminate and be replaced by new options to
purchase Zoran Common Stock in the manner described in Section 6.13(c).

  

### 

  

### (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Zoran
shall deliver to each holder of an Oak Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time an appropriate notice evidencing the foregoing assumption of
the option by Zoran.  Zoran shall comply with the terms of the Oak Option
Plans and the agreements evidencing the Oak Options, subject to the
adjustments pursuant to this Section, and ensure, to the extent required by,
and subject to the provisions of each such plan and agreement, that Oak
Options which qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the
Effective Time will continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the
Effective Time to the maximum extent permitted by Section 422 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (f) Zoran shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Zoran Common Stock for delivery
upon the exercise of the Oak Options assumed in accordance with this Section
6.13.  As soon as practicable after the Effective

  

### 

  

### 44      
   

### 

  

### Time, and not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, Zoran shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Zoran Common Stock subject to
the Oak Options assumed pursuant to this Section 6.13 and shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Oak Options
remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent
to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Zoran shall administer Oak
Options assumed pursuant to this Section 6.13 in a manner that complies with
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the Oak Options
complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (g) Oak shall take such action as is necessary to (i) terminate the Oak
Purchase Plan as of the Effective Time and (ii) cause the ending date of the
then current Purchase Period of the Oak Purchase Plan (as such term is
defined therein) on or before the last trading day on which the Oak Common
Stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Final Oak Purchase Date_ "). On the Final Oak Purchase Date, Oak
shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the Oak Purchase Plan
within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of
whole shares of Oak Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Oak
Purchase Plan, which shares shall be treated in the manner described in
Section 2.1(d).

  

### 

  

### (h) Employees of Oak as of the Effective Time shall be permitted to
participate in the Zoran Purchase Plan commencing on the first enrollment
date of such plan following the Effective Time, subject to the eligibility
provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for purposes of
such eligibility provisions, for service with Oak or Zoran).

  

### 

  

### (i) Except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, to
the extent that any employee of Oak or any of Oak Subsidiaries becomes
eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan of Zoran after the
Effective Time, Zoran, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries, to
the extent such employee benefit plan permits, shall credit such employees
service with Oak or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining such
employees eligibility to participate in and vesting under, and for purposes
of calculating the benefits under, such employee benefit plan. Zoran, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries will (i) waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any employee of Oak or
any of Oaks Subsidiaries under any welfare plan that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted
by such plan, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under any welfare plan maintained for such employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such employee
with credit for any credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid prior to
the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plan that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by such
plan.

## Section 6.14 _Brokers or Finders_. Each of Zoran and Oak represents, as
to itself, its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, that no agent, broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person is or will be
entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or
similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except Morgan Stanley, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Oak
in accordance with Oaks agreement with such firm, and Merrill Lynch, whose
fees and expenses will be paid by Zoran in accordance with Zorans agreement
with such firm, and each of Zoran and Oak agrees to indemnify and hold the
other harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or
obligations with respect to any other fees, commissions or expenses asserted
by any person on the basis of any act or statement alleged to have been made
by such party or its Affiliate.

## Section 6.15 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Zoran and the Surviving
Corporation shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Oak or any of
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of Oak or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or
at or after, the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") including,
without limitation, all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities
or judgments based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall pay, in advance of the
final disposition of any such Proceeding, all reasonable expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by such persons in connection with any
such Proceeding. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 6.15, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Oak, Zoran or the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify an Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section
6.15 except to the extent such failure prejudices such party), and, in
connection with any request for an advancement of expenses, shall deliver to
Oak (or after the Effective Time, Zoran and the Surviving Corporation) an
undertaking of the type contemplated by Section 145(e) of the DGCL.  The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
with respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
Zoran will fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Oak pursuant
to Oaks Bylaws, as in effect as of the date hereof, and any indemnification
agreement between Oak and any of Oak directors and officers existing and in
force as of the date of this Agreement and filed as an exhibit to the Oak SEC
Reports.

  

### 

  

### 46      
   

### 

  

### (c) Zoran shall obtain prior to the Closing and shall thereafter
maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect a policy
or policies of directors and officers liability insurance with coverage
substantially comparable to policies in force as of the date of this
Agreement (copies of which have been provided to Zoran) covering the
directors and officers of Oak as of the date of this Agreement for a
period of not less than six (6) years following the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that should such comparable coverage be unavailable
for an aggregate premium of less than 250% of the aggregate annual premiums
currently paid by Oak for such insurance, Zoran and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to obtain such lesser coverage as may be
obtained for such amount.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 6.15 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed
without the written consent of any affected Indemnified Party.

  

### 

  

## Section 6.16 _Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts_.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes

all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
either of the Constituent Corporations, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.

day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Oak and its ERISA Affiliates, as

Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, the _"401(k) Plans_ ") unless Zoran
provides written notice to Oak that any 401(k) Plan shall not be so
terminated. Unless Zoran provides such written notice to Oak, no later than
five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Oak shall provide to Zoran
(i) copies of duly adopted resolutions by Oaks Board of Directors
authorizing the termination of such 401(k) Plans and (ii) with respect to
each 401(k) Plan, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to
assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and
regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan
shall be maintained at the time of termination. The form and substance
of such resolutions and amendment shall be subject to the prior review
and approval of Zoran.

  

## 

  

## Section 6.18 _Zoran Board of Directors_. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Zoran Board
of Directors shall designate three (3) non-employee members of the Oak Board
of Directors to be elected as members of the Zoran Board of Directors,

the Zoran Board of Directors fail, for any reason, to designate all three Oak
Board Designees by the date which is five (5) days prior to the date the
final Joint Proxy Statement is expected to be printed for mailing to the Oak
and Zoran stockholders, the Oak Board of Directors shall have the right (but
not the obligation), by written notice to Zoran, to designate any remaining
Oak Board

  

##

Board of Directors, effective as of the Effective Time.

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

  



  

 **VOTING AGREEMENT**

  



  

 **(Oak Stockholder)**

  



  

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of May 4, 2003 by and
between Zoran Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Zoran_ "), and the
undersigned stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Oak Technology, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Oak_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Zinc Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran (" _Sub_ "), and
Oak have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "
_Reorganization Agreement_ "), providing for the merger of Oak with and into
Sub (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which Oak will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran;

  



  

B. The Stockholder is the holder of record or beneficial owner of the number
of shares of the outstanding Common Stock of Oak indicated on the final page
of this Agreement (the " _Shares_ ");

  



  

C. In connection with the Merger, Zoran will acquire the Stockholders entire
equity interest in Oak and the Stockholder will receive in exchange an equity
interest in Zoran and a cash payment; and

  



  

D. In consideration of and to induce the execution of the Reorganization
Agreement by Zoran, the Stockholder agrees not to sell or otherwise dispose
of any shares of Oak stock held by the Stockholder and to vote the Shares so
as to facilitate consummation of the Merger, as more fully described below.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# 1. _Agreement to Retain Shares_. The Stockholder agrees not to transfer,
pledge, sell, exchange or offer to transfer or sell or otherwise dispose of
or encumber any of the Shares at any time prior to the Expiration Date, as
defined herein. The " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier of (i) the
date and time on which the Merger shall become effective in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement or (ii) the date on
which the Reorganization Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

# 

  

# 2. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. At any meeting of the Oak stockholders
called with respect to any of the following, and at any adjournment thereof,
and with respect to any written consent solicited with respect to any of the
following, the Stockholder agrees to vote the Shares: (i) in favor of
approval of the Reorganization Agreement and the Merger and any matter which

  



  

1      
   



  

# would, or could reasonably be expected to, facilitate the Merger and (ii)
against (A) approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition
with consummation of the Merger and the Reorganization Agreement, (B)
any merger, consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization or
recapitalization involving Oak (other than the Merger and related matters),
(C) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Oak and (D) any other
matter which would, or could reasonably be expected to, prohibit, delay or
discourage the Merger (each of the foregoing being referred to as an "
_Opposing Proposal_ "). The Stockholder, as the holder of voting stock of Oak
agrees to be present, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of stockholders
of Oak so that all Shares are counted for the purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum at such meetings. This Agreement is intended to bind
the Stockholder only with respect to the specific matters set forth herein,
and shall not prohibit the Stockholder from acting in accordance with his
fiduciary duties as an officer or director of Oak.

  

# 

  

# 3. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Stockholder agrees to deliver to Zoran a proxy in the form attached
hereto as _Annex A_ (the " _Proxy_ "), which shall be irrevocable to the
extent provided therein; provided that the Proxy shall be revoked upon
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

# 

  

# 4. _Additional Purchases_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Shares" shall include any shares of Oak capital stock which the Stockholder
purchases or otherwise acquires after the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the Expiration Date.

  

# 

  

# 5. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Stockholder_. The
Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Zoran as follows:

  

# 

  

## 5.1 _Ownership of Shares_. Except as specifically described on _Annex
B_ to this Agreement, the Stockholder (i) is the holder and beneficial
owner of the Shares, which at the date hereof and at all times until the
Expiration Date will be free and clear of any liens, claims, options, charges
or other encumbrances, (ii) does not beneficially own any shares of stock of
Oak other than the Shares and (iii) has full power and authority to
make, enter into, deliver and carry out the terms of this Agreement and the
Proxy.

  

## 

  

## 5.2 _Validity; No Conflict_. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity. Neither the execution of this Agreement by the
Stockholder nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement by which
the Stockholder is bound or of any decree, judgment, order, law or regulation
now in effect of any court or other governmental body applicable to
the Stockholder.

  

## 

  

## 5.3 _No Voting Trusts or Agreements_. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Expiration Date, the Stockholder will not, and will not permit any
entity under the Stockholders control to, deposit any shares of Oak capital
stock held by the Stockholder or such entity in a voting trust or subject any
shares of Oak capital stock held by the Stockholder or such entity to any
arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such shares of capital
stock,

  



  

2      
   



  

## other than agreements entered into with Zoran, unless the trustee of such
trust agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 5.4 _No Proxy Solicitations_. Between the date hereof and the
Expiration Date, the Stockholder will not, and will not permit any entity
under the Stockholders control to, (a) solicit proxies or become a
participant in a "solicitation" (as such term is defined in Rule 14a-11 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")),
with respect to an Opposing Proposal or otherwise encourage or assist any
party in taking or planning any action which would compete with, restrain or
otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, (b)
initiate a stockholders vote or action by written consent of Oak
stockholders with respect to an Opposing Proposal or (c) become a member of a
"group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with
respect to any voting securities of Oak with respect to an Opposing Proposal.

  

## 

  

# 6. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Zoran_.  Zoran
represents, warrants and covenants to the Stockholder as follows:

  

#

necessary corporate action on the part of Zoran and has been duly executed by
a duly authorized officer of Zoran.

  

## 

  

## 6.2 _Validity; No Conflict_. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Zoran, enforceable against Zoran in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.
Neither the execution of this Agreement by Zoran nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result in a breach or violation of the
terms of any agreement by which Zoran is bound or of any decree, judgment,
order, law or regulation now in effect of any court or other governmental
body applicable to Zoran.

  

## 

  

# 7. _Additional Documents_. The Stockholder and Zoran hereby covenant and
agree to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable,
in the reasonable opinion of Zorans legal counsel or the Stockholder, as the
case may be, to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

  

# 

  

# 8. _Consent and Waiver_. The Stockholder hereby gives any consent or
waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under
the terms of any agreement to which the Stockholder is a party or pursuant to
any other rights the Stockholder may have.

  

# 

  

# 9. _Miscellaneous_.

  

# 

  

9.1 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

other.

agreements of the Stockholder set forth herein.  Therefore, it is agreed

 **VOTING AGREEMENT**

  



  

 **(Zoran Stockholder)**

  



  

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of May 4, 2003 by and
between Oak Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Oak_ "), and the
undersigned stockholder (the " _Stockholder_ ") of Zoran Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Zoran_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Zinc Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran (" _Sub_ "), and
Oak have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "
_Reorganization Agreement_ "), providing for the merger of Oak with and into
Sub (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which Oak will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran;

  



  

B. The Stockholder is the holder of record or beneficial owner of the number
of shares of the outstanding Common Stock of Zoran indicated on the final
page of this Agreement (the " _Shares_ "); and

  



  

C. In consideration of and to induce the execution of the Reorganization
Agreement by Oak, the Stockholder agrees not to sell or otherwise dispose of
any shares of Zoran stock held by the Stockholder and to vote the Shares so
as to facilitate consummation of the Merger, as more fully described below.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# 1. _Agreement to Retain Shares_. The Stockholder agrees not to transfer,
pledge, sell, exchange or offer to transfer or sell or otherwise dispose of
or encumber any of the Shares at any time prior to the Expiration Date, as
defined herein. The " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earlier of (i) the
date and time on which the Merger shall become effective in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement or (ii) the date on
which the Reorganization Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to its terms.

  

# 

  

# 2. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. At any meeting of the Zoran stockholders
called with respect to any of the following, and at any adjournment thereof,
and with respect to any written consent solicited with respect to any of the
following, the Stockholder agrees to vote the Shares: (i) in favor of
approval of the issuance of shares of Zoran Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger and any matter which would, or could reasonably be expected to,
facilitate the Merger and (ii) against (A) approval of any proposal made in
opposition to or in competition with consummation of the Merger and the
Reorganization Agreement, (B) any merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
reorganization or recapitalization involving Zoran (other than the Merger and

  

# 

  

1      
   



  

# related matters and other transactions specifically permitted by the
Reorganization Agreement), (C) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
Zoran and (D) any other matter which would, or could reasonably be expected
to, prohibit, delay or discourage the Merger (each of the foregoing being
referred to as an " _Opposing Proposal_ ").  The Stockholder, as the holder
of voting stock of Zoran agrees to be present, in person or by proxy, at all
meetings of stockholders of Zoran so that all Shares are counted for the
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such meetings. This
Agreement is intended to bind the Stockholder only with respect to the
specific matters set forth herein, and shall not prohibit the Stockholder
from acting in accordance with his fiduciary duties as an officer or director
of Zoran.

  

# 

  

# 3. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Stockholder agrees to deliver to Oak a proxy in the form attached hereto
as _Annex A_ (the " _Proxy_ "), which shall be irrevocable to the extent
provided therein; provided that the Proxy shall be revoked upon termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

# 

  

# 4. _Additional Purchases_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Shares" shall include any shares of Zoran capital stock which the
Stockholder purchases or otherwise acquires after the execution of
this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date.

  

# 

  

# 5. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Stockholder_. The
Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Oak as follows:

  

# 

  

## 5.1 _Ownership of Shares_. Except as specifically described on _Annex
B_ to this Agreement, the Stockholder (i) is the holder and beneficial
owner of the Shares, which at the date hereof and at all times until the
Expiration Date will be free and clear of any liens, claims, options, charges
or other encumbrances, (ii) does not beneficially own any shares of stock of
Zoran other than the Shares and (iii) has full power and authority to
make, enter into, deliver and carry out the terms of this Agreement and the
Proxy.

  

## 

  

## 5.2 _Validity; No Conflict_. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity. Neither the execution of this Agreement by the
Stockholder nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in a breach or violation of the terms of any agreement by which
the Stockholder is bound or of any decree, judgment, order, law or regulation
now in effect of any court or other governmental body applicable to
the Stockholder.

  

## 

  

## 5.3 _No Voting Trusts or Agreements_. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Expiration Date, the Stockholder will not, and will not permit any
entity under the Stockholders control to, deposit any shares of Zoran
capital stock held by the Stockholder or such entity in a voting trust or
subject any shares of Zoran capital stock held by the Stockholder or such
entity to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such
shares of capital stock, other than agreements entered into with Oak, unless
the trustee of such trust agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement.

  

## 

  

2      
   



  

## 5.4 _No Proxy Solicitations_. Between the date hereof and the
Expiration Date, the Stockholder will not, and will not permit any entity
under the Stockholders control to, (a) solicit proxies or become a
participant in a "solicitation" (as such term is defined in Rule 14a-11 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")),
with respect to an Opposing Proposal or otherwise encourage or assist any
party in taking or planning any action which would compete with, restrain or
otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, (b)
initiate a stockholders vote or action by written consent of Zoran
stockholders with respect to an Opposing Proposal or (c) become a member of a
"group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with
respect to any voting securities of Zoran with respect to an Opposing
Proposal.

  

## 

  

# 6. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Oak_.  Oak represents,
warrants and covenants to the Stockholder as follows:

  

# 

  

## 6.1 _Due Authorization_. This Agreement has been authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Oak and has been duly executed
by a duly authorized officer of Oak.

  

## 

  

## 6.2 _Validity; No Conflict_. This Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Oak, enforceable against Oak in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.  Neither
the execution of this Agreement by Oak nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result in a breach or violation of the
terms of any agreement by which Oak is bound or of any decree,
judgment, order, law or regulation now in effect of any court or other
governmental body applicable to Oak.

  

## 

  

# 7. _Additional Documents_. The Stockholder and Oak hereby covenant and
agree to execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable,
in the reasonable opinion of Oaks legal counsel or the Stockholder, as the
case may be, to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

  

# 

  

# 8. _Consent and Waiver_. The Stockholder hereby gives any consent or
waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under
the terms of any agreement to which the Stockholder is a party or pursuant to
any other rights the Stockholder may have.

  

# 

  

# 9. _Miscellaneous_.

  

# 

  

9.1 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

  



  

## 9.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but,
