MOTOROLA, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), EARTH  ------ ACQUISITION
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of

approved this  ------ Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and declared the Merger advisable;  
WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to action taken in accordance with the requirements of the
Delaware General Corporation Law and the bylaws of Merger Sub;   WHEREAS,
pursuant to the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company
shall be converted into shares of common stock of Parent at the rate
determined herein;   WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is
intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

agreements set forth herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows:   1   
ARTICLE I  THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING

subject to the conditions set forth in  ---------- this Agreement, and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the
"DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and 
---- into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub
in accordance with the DGCL. The Company, as the surviving corporation after
the consummation of the Merger, is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Surviving  --------- Corporation." -----------   1.2 Closing. Unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated and the  ------- transactions
contemplated herein shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article 
------- VIII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., ---- ------- local time, at the offices of counsel for Parent,
on the first business day after all of the conditions (excluding conditions
that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger as set forth in Article
VII have been satisfied or waived  ----------- (subject to applicable law),
or such other date, time or place as is agreed to in writing by the Parties
(the actual time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the
"Closing Date").  ------------   1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, the  -------------- Parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing the certificate of merger of Merger Sub
and the Company (the "Certificate of Merger") with the 
--------------------- Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL as soon as practicable on or before the Closing Date. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware or at such subsequent date or
time as the Parties shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
date and time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time").  --------------   1.4 Effect of the Merger. At and
after the Effective Time, the effect of  -------------------- the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE II  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND 
--------------------------------  BY-LAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION 
------------------------------------   2.1 Certificate of Incorporation. At
and after the Effective Time, and  ---------------------------- without any
further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as the
certificate of   2   incorporation of Merger Sub reads as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law, provided that such certificate of
incorporation shall be amended to reflect Blue Wave Systems Inc. as the name
of the Surviving Corporation.   2.2 Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect  ------ immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   ARTICLE
III  DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF  -------------------------  THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION AND PARENT  ------------------------------------   3.1
Directors of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of the 
-------------------------------------- Surviving Corporation, as of the
Effective Time, will be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   3.2 Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of
the Surviving  ------------------------------------- Corporation, as of the
Effective Time, will be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE IV  MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR 
-----------------------------------  CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER 
------------------------------------   4.1 Share Consideration for the
Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of 
----------------------------------------------------------------- Shares in
the Merger. At the Effective Time, the manner of converting
or -------------------- canceling shares of the Company and Parent shall be
as follows:   (a) Effect on Capital Stock. (i) At the Effective Time, each
share  -----------------------  of common stock, $0.01 par value ("Company
Shares"), of the Company issued  --------------  and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the  Cancelled Shares, as defined in
Section 4.1(b), shall be converted into the  --------------  right to
receive that number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid  and
nonassessable shares of common stock, $3.00 par value, of Parent 
(collectively, "Parent Shares") (together with the associated Parent Rights 
-------------  and with any cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid
pursuant to  Section 4.3, the "Merger Consideration") equal to the Exchange
Ratio. The  ----------- --------------------  "Exchange Ratio" shall be
determined as follows and shall be subject to  --------------  adjustment
pursuant to Section 8.3:  -----------   (1) If the Parent Market Price is
less than or equal to  $25.38 the Exchange Ratio shall equal .3947; and  
(2) If the Parent Market Price is greater than $25.38, the  Exchange Ratio
shall equal a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-  ten-thousandth), the
numerator of which is $10.02, and the  denominator of which is the Parent
Market Price.   3    For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Market
Price" shall mean the  -------------------  average daily closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on  the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Tape for the  ----  Applicable Trading Days,
"Applicable Trading Days" shall mean the twenty  ----------------------- 
(20) trading days ending on and including the Determination Date, and 
"Determination Date" shall mean the third NYSE trading day preceding the 
------------------  Closing Date.   (ii) As a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part  of the holders thereof, at the Effective
Time, all Company Shares  shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and  retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate  which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any Company  Shares (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights  -----------  with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except as  provided herein or by law.   (b) Cancellation of Parent
Owned and Treasury Stock. All of the 
-----------------------------------------------  Company Shares that are
owned by Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-  owned subsidiary of Parent
or by the Company as treasury stock  (collectively, the "Cancelled Shares")
shall, by virtue of the Merger,  ----------------  cease to be outstanding
and shall be canceled and retired and no Parent  Shares, Parent Rights or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange  therefor.   (c) Stock
of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, 
-------------------  of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective  Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of  the holder thereof, be converted automatically into and
exchanged for one  (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock,  $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate  representing any shares of Merger Sub shall continue to
represent ownership  of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) Associated Rights. References in Article IV of this
Agreement to  ----------------- ----------  Parent Shares shall include,
unless the context requires otherwise, the  associated Parent Rights.   (e)
Options; Stock Plans.  --------------------   (i) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board of Directors  will adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions  necessary to amend the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Stock
Option Plan to  provide that, as of the Effective Time, each option that is 
outstanding under the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Stock Option Plan (each,  a
"Blue Wave Employee Option") will be converted into an option to 
-------------------------  purchase Parent Shares (a "Converted Blue Wave
Option"), if with  --------------------------  respect to each outstanding
option the holder of the option has, by  the Effective Time, signed an
agreement consenting to the terms of the  conversion described in the
following three sentences, and if Parent  has received that signed  
4    agreement by the Effective Time. The number of Parent Shares subject 
to each Converted Blue Wave Option will be the number of Company  Shares that
were subject to the option before conversion, multiplied  by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounded down to the next whole number. The  per-share exercise
price of each Converted Blue Wave Option will be  the exercise price of the
option before conversion, divided by the  Exchange Ratio, and the expiration
date of each Converted Blue Wave  Option will be identical to the expiration
date contained in the Blue  Wave Employee Option prior to conversion. Each
Converted Blue Wave  Option will be fully vested from and after the Effective
Time, and  will be exercisable approximately ten (10) business days after
the  Effective Time, but will be subject to the terms regarding ability, 
time and conditions of exercise after termination due to death,  disability,
retirement, cause or other reasons; manner of exercise;  the effect of a
change in control; transferability; and other terms  and conditions of the
option as are generally applicable to options  granted under the Motorola
Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000. The Company  affirms that, because the plan
amendment will not apply to an option  that is not subject to an agreement
consenting to the terms of  conversion described above, any Blue Wave
Employee Option regarding  which the holder does not sign such an agreement
will, in accordance  with the terms of the Blue Wave Systems Inc. Stock
Option Plan,  terminate at the Effective Time and be of no further force and
effect.  The Company will prepare the necessary agreements consenting to
the  terms of the conversion described in this Section 4.1(e)(i); provided, 
---------------- --------  however, such agreements shall be subject to
Parent\'s approval. The  -------  Company will be responsible for seeing
that the agreements consenting  to the terms of the conversion are
distributed and signed by Blue Wave  Employee Option holders, and that copies
of the signed agreements are  received by Parent prior to the Effective
Time.   (ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors 
will adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions  necessary
(including obtaining the written consent of any option  holder as
contemplated by Section 7.3(i) hereof) to terminate the Blue 
---------------------  Wave Systems Inc. Directors\' Stock Option Plan
effective at the  Effective Time, so that all options under the Blue Wave
Systems Inc.  Directors\' Stock Option Plan that are not exercised prior to
the  Effective Time will terminate effective at the Effective Time.   (iii)
Each option assumed by Mizar, Inc. from Loughborough Sound  Images Limited in
connection with the transactions contemplated by  that certain share purchase
agreement dated November 17, 1997 between  Mizar, Inc. and Loughborough Sound
Images Limited, as amended by that  certain letter agreement dated March 24,
1998 (the "LSI Options"), and  -----------  each option issued pursuant to
the Trust Deed of the LSI Employee  Share Trust (the "Eagle Trust Options")
will be converted into an  -------------------  option to purchase Parent
Shares, according to the terms described in   5    the remainder of this
Section 4.1(e)(iii). From and after the  -------------------  Effective
Time, each LSI Option or Eagle Trust Option will entitle its  holder to
purchase a number of Parent Shares equal to the number of  Company Shares
that were subject to the option before conversion,  multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the next whole  number. The per-share
exercise price of the LSI Option or Eagle Trust  Option after conversion will
equal the option\'s per-share exercise  price before conversion, divided by
the Exchange Ratio.   (iv) Any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement
providing  for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of
the  capital stock of the Company or any Affiliate will terminate as of the 
Effective Time, and no individual will have any rights under any such  plan,
program, agreement or arrangement.   (f) Reservation of Parent Shares.
Parent shall take all corporate  ----------------------------  action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent  Shares for
delivery upon exercise of any Converted Blue Wave Options or LSI  Options in
accordance with Section 4.1(e). As soon as practicable after 
--------------  the Closing Date, to the extent required to effect
registration of the  Parent Shares subject to each Converted Blue Wave Option
or LSI Option,  Parent shall file a registration statement, or an amendment
to an existing  registration statement, under the Securities Act on Form S-8
(or other  successor form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to such
Converted  Blue Wave Options or LSI Options and shall use its best efforts to
maintain  the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as
such  Converted Blue Wave Options or LSI Options remain outstanding. In 
addition, Parent will cause such shares to be listed on the NYSE.   (g)
Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and 
-------------------  the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Shares or
Parent Shares shall  have been changed into a different number of shares or
different class by  reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, split-up,  combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or
dividend payable  in any other securities shall be declared with a record
date within such  period, or any similar event shall have occurred, (i) the
Exchange Ratio  shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Company Shares  the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such  event, and (ii) any references to the Parent Market Price
relating to a  party\'s termination rights hereunder shall also be
approximately adjusted.   4.2 Payment for Shares in the Merger. The manner
of making payment for  -------------------------------- Shares in the Merger
shall be as follows:   (a) Exchange Agent. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall  --------------  appoint a commercial bank or trust company
having net capital of not less  than $300,000,000 or a wholly-owned
subsidiary thereof to act as exchange  agent hereunder for the purposes of
exchanging Certificates for Company  Shares (the   6    "Exchange
Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Date, Parent shall deposit 
--------------  with the Exchange Agent in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company  Shares, a sufficient number of certificates representing
the Parent Shares  required to effect the delivery of the aggregate
consideration in Parent  Shares and cash for the fractional Parent Shares
required to be delivered  pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3 (the certificates
representing the Parent  ------------ ---  Shares comprising the Merger
Consideration being referred to hereinafter as  the "Stock Merger Exchange
Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to  -------------------------- 
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Stock 
Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund. The Stock Merger 
Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund shall not be used for any 
other purpose than as set forth herein.   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent  -------------------  shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of  outstanding Company
Shares (i) a form of letter of transmittal, in a form  reasonably
satisfactory to the Parties and (ii) instructions for use in  effecting the
surrender of Certificates for payment therefor. Upon  surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together  with such
letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance  with the
instructions thereto, and any other documents as may be required  by the
Exchange Act, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to  receive in
exchange for each of the Company Shares represented by the  Certificates held
of record by such holder one (1) or more Parent Shares  (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical  certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number  of Parent Shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to  Section 4.1(a) and (2) a check
in the amount equal to the cash that such  --------------  holder has the
right to receive in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares  pursuant to
Sections 4.1 and 4.3. No interest will be paid or will accrue  ------------
---  on any cash payable pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3. The Certificates
so  ------------ ---  surrendered pursuant to this Section 4.2(b) shall
forthwith be canceled.  --------------  Until so surrendered, such
Certificates shall represent solely the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration allocable to such Certificates.   (c) Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or 
------------------------------------------------  other distributions that
are declared or made with respect to Parent Shares  with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of  any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares that such  holder would be
entitled to receive by reason of the Merger upon surrender  of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares  shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3 until  ------------
---  such holder shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of 
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be

interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any 
cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which such holder is 
entitled pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3 and the amount of dividends or 
------------ ---  other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore  paid prior to the time of such surrender with respect to
such whole Parent  Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends  or other distributions   7    with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and  a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such  Parent Shares. Any
dividends or other distributions that are payable with  respect to Parent
Shares deliverable upon surrender of unexchanged  Certificates shall be
deposited by Parent in the Stock Merger Exchange  Fund.   (d) Transfers of
Ownership. If any certificate representing Parent  ---------------------- 
Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate 
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of 
such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly  endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person  requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or  other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such  Parent Shares in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the  Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the  Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (e) No Liability.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the Parties  ------------  shall be
liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Parent Shares or  dividends
thereon, or, in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 4.3, cash in  ------------
---  lieu of fractional Parent Shares, delivered to a public official
pursuant  to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. The
Exchange  Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership  with respect to the Parent Shares held by it from time to time
hereunder,  except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions  paid or distributed with respect to such Parent Shares for the
account of  the Persons entitled thereto.   (f) Termination of Funds.
Subject to applicable law, any portion of  --------------------  the Stock
Merger Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund which  remains
unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for six months  after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise  directed by
Parent, and any former stockholder of the Company shall  thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of their applicable claim for  the Merger Consideration
for their Company Shares. Any such portion of the  Stock Merger Exchange Fund
and the Fractional Securities Fund remaining  unclaimed by holders of Company
Shares five years after the Effective Time  (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would  otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity having  jurisdiction thereover) shall, to
the extent permitted by law, become the  property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or  interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (g) No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Shares. All Parent Shares  --------------------------------------------- 
issued and cash paid upon conversion of Company Shares in accordance with 
the terms of this Article IV (including any cash paid pursuant to Sections 
---------- --------  4.1 and 4.3) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid
in full  --- ---  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Shares.   8    4.3 Cash For Fractional Parent Shares. No certificates or
scrip or shares  --------------------------------- of Parent Shares
representing fractional Parent Shares or book-entry credit of the same shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any
rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of Parent
Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash
payment (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
fractional interest of a Parent Share to which such holder otherwise would
have been entitled multiplied by (ii) the closing price of a Parent Share on
the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the trading day immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the cash comprising such aggregate payments in lieu
of fractional Parent Shares being hereinafter referred to as the
"Fractional  ---------- Securities Fund"). ---------------   4.4 Transfer
of Shares after the Effective Time. No transfers of Company 
------------------------------------------- Shares shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Company after the close of business on the day prior to
the date of the Effective Time.   4.5 Investment of the Stock Merger
Exchange Fund and Fractional Securities 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund.

Merger ---- Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund in obligations
of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investor Services or
Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, in each case with maturities
not exceeding seven days; provided, that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to Article
IV and the other provisions  ---------- of this Agreement. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to
Parent.   4.6 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or  ----------------- destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation (or Parent, as
applicable), the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation (or Parent, as applicable) may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby and unpaid
dividends and distributions on Parent Shares deliverable in respect thereof,
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   4.7
Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and 
------------------ directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Sub, as applicable, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise

acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.   4.8 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the  ---------- fullest extent permitted by law, no certificates

Person has executed and delivered  ----------- a Company Affiliate Agreement
to Parent.   ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

obtain could not reasonably be expected to  have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on  the Company or impair or delay the
ability of the Company to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

and in good standing under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its incorporation
and has all requisite corporate  power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to  carry on its business as now being conducted
except where the failure  to be so organized, existing and in good standing
or to have such  power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
such  Subsidiary.   (ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified  or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction  (including any foreign country) in which the property owned,
leased or  operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes  such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure
to  be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a  Material
Adverse Effect on such Subsidiary.   (iii) The Company has heretofore
furnished or made available to  Parent complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation  and bylaws or the equivalent organizational
documents of each of its  Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.1(e) (the
"Material Subsidiaries"),  --------------- ---------------------  each as
amended to the date hereof, as requested by Parent. Such  certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational  documents are in full

Company and its Subsidiaries taken as  a whole. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.1(e), no entity in which  ---------------  the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, less than a 50% equity  interest is, individually or
when taken together with all other such  entities, material to the business
of   14    the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No
Subsidiary of  the Company that is not a Material Subsidiary has any
material  liabilities.   (f) SEC Reports and Financial Statements. 
------------------------------------   (i) Since January 1, 1998, the
Company has timely filed all  required reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents  required to be filed by it with the SEC (collectively,
including all  exhibits thereto, the "Company SEC Reports"). The Company
SEC  -------------------  Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if
amended or superseded  by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or of
the Closing  Date, then on the date of such filing), did not, and any Company
SEC  Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, 
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a  material

their  respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the 
respective Company SEC Report filed prior to the date hereof),  complied in
all respects with the applicable requirements of the  Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder (as in
effect on the dates on which such  Company SEC Reports were filed).   (ii)
Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed and  publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, and except for  liabilities and
obligations incurred in the Ordinary Course of  Business since September 30,

individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company),
the Company does not have any  undisclosed liabilities or obligations of any
nature required by GAAP  to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company or  which have had or are reasonably likely to have, individually
or in  the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (iii) The
Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct  copy of any
amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed  with the SEC, to
all agreements, documents or other   15    instruments which previously

and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby will not,
conflict with, or result in  any violation of, or constitute a default (with
or without notice or  lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of consent,  termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any

any  applicable jurisdictions, including without limitation, requirements, 
if any, arising out of the HSR Act and (y) such consents, approvals,  orders,

to make or obtain could not reasonably be expected to  have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on  Parent or Merger Sub or
impair or delay the ability of Parent or  Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or
Merger Sub will use its  reasonable best efforts to obtain all the consents
required to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) SEC
Reports and Financial Statements.  ------------------------------------  
(i) Since January 1, 1998, Parent has timely filed all required  reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to  be filed by it
with the SEC (collectively, including all exhibits  thereto, the "Parent SEC
Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports, as of  ------------------  their
respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing  prior to the
date of this Agreement or of the Closing Date, then on  the date of such
filing), did not, and any Parent SEC Reports filed  with the SEC subsequent
to the date hereof will not, contain any  untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated (or incorporated by
reference) therein or  necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the  financial statements (including the related notes) included or to be 
included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Parent SEC Reports 
present or will present fairly, in all material respects, the  financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of Parent  as of the
respective dates or for the respective periods set forth  therein, all in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the  periods involved except
as otherwise noted therein, and subject, in  the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal and  recurring year-end adjustments
that have not been and will not be  material in amount. All of such Parent
SEC Reports, as of their  respective dates (and as of the date of any
amendment to the  respective Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date
hereof),   44    complied in all respects with the applicable
requirements of the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations  promulgated thereunder (as in effect on the dates on which such
Parent  SEC Reports were filed).   (ii) Except as set forth in the Parent
SEC Reports filed and  publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, and except for  liabilities and obligations incurred in the
Ordinary Course of  Business since September 30, 2000 (none of which has had
or could be  reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent), Parent does not have any  undisclosed
liabilities or obligations of any nature required by GAAP  to be set forth on
a consolidated balance sheet of Parent or which  have had or are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.   (iii) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and
correct  copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been
filed  with the SEC, to all agreements, documents or other instruments
which  previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to the 
Exchange Act.   (e) S-4 Registration Statement and Proxy

time it becomes effective or at the Effective Time,  contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any  material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make  the statements therein not
misleading, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy  Statement, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement and at the  time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a  material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of  the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. If at any time  prior to the Effective Time any
event with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or  any of their respective
Affiliates, officers and directors or any of its  Subsidiaries should occur
which is required to be described in an amendment  of, or a supplement to,
the Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration  Statement, Parent shall promptly
inform the Company, such event shall be so  described, and such amendment or
supplement shall be promptly filed with  the SEC. The S-4 Registration
Statement will (with respect to Parent and  Merger Sub) comply as to form in
all material respects with the  requirements of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder. The Proxy Statement will (with
respect to Parent  and Merger Sub) comply as to form in all material respects
with the  requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated  thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.2(e),  -------------  no representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect  to statements made or incorporated by  
45    reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement
based on  information supplied by the Company or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or  incorporation by reference therein.   (f) Events Subsequent.
Since September 30, 2000 to the date hereof,  -----------------  there has
not been any Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.   (g)
Litigation. There is no litigation, arbitration, claim, suit,  ---------- 
action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, 
threatened against or affecting Parent, Merger Sub or any of their 
respective properties or assets, which has had or could reasonably be 
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse 
Effect on Parent, nor is there any judgment, award, decree, injunction,  rule
or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against  Parent
or Merger Sub which would reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   (h) Brokers. Other
than to Goldman, Sachs and Co., neither Parent nor  -------  Merger Sub has
any Liability to pay any fees or commissions to any broker,  finder, or agent
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.   (i)
Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities. 
--------------------------------------------   (i) Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging  in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (ii) As of the Effective Time, all of the outstanding capital

Time, there will be no options, warrants or other rights  (including
registration rights), agreements, arrangements or  commitments to which
Merger Sub is a party of any character relating  to the issued or unissued
capital stock of, or other equity interests  in, Merger Sub or obligating
Merger Sub to grant, issue or sell any  shares of the capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, Merger  Sub, by sale, lease, license or otherwise.
There are no obligations,  contingent or otherwise, of Merger Sub to
repurchase, redeem or  otherwise acquire any shares of the capital stock of
Merger Sub.   (iii) As of the date hereof and the Effective Time, except
for  obligations or Liabilities incurred in connection with its 
incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by  this
Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred,  directly or
indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliates, any  obligations or
Liabilities or engaged in any business activities of  any type whatsoever or
entered into any agreements or arrangements  with any Person.   46

---------------   (a) The Company shall immediately cease and terminate any
existing  solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or 
negotiation with any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company, its 
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any 
proposed, potential or contemplated Acquisition Proposal.   (b) From and
after the date hereof, without the prior written consent  of Parent, the
Company will not, will not authorize or permit any of its  Subsidiaries to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all of  its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, financial  advisors, agents or
representatives (each a "Representative") not to,  --------------  directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of 
furnishing information) or take any other action to facilitate any  inquiries
or the making of any proposal which constitutes or may reasonably  be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any Person (a "Third 
-----  Party"), or engage in any discussion or negotiations relating thereto
or  -----  accept any Acquisition Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (b) above, (i) the  Company may, in response to an
unsolicited written offer or proposal with  respect to a potential or
proposed Acquisition Proposal engage in  negotiations or discussions with, or
provide information or data to, any  Third Party relating to any Acquisition
Proposal if (i) the Acquisition  Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the
Company\'s Board of Directors  determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel to  the Company, that such action is required to
comply with its fiduciary  duties under applicable law. Any information
furnished to any Third Party  in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be provided  pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill
agreement on customary terms  (including prohibitions on unsolicited
tender   50    offers, acquisitions of equity interests in the Company,
proposals to  acquire stock or assets, formation of Section 13(d) groups,
public requests  for release from the standstill, actions that would require
the Company to  make a public announcement and engaging in proxy contests).
Subject to all  of the foregoing requirements, the Company will (x)
immediately notify  Parent orally and in writing if any discussions or
negotiations are sought  to be initiated, any inquiry or proposal is made, or
any information is  requested by any Third Party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or  which could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (y)
immediately notify Parent  of all material terms of any Acquisition Proposal,
including the identity  of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or
the request for  information, if known, and including with such notice any
documentation  relating to such Acquisition Proposal, and (z) thereafter
shall inform  Parent on a timely, ongoing basis of the status and content of
any  discussions or negotiations with a Third Party, including immediately 
reporting any changes to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition 
Proposal, including with such notice any documentation relating to such 
Acquisition Proposal.   (d) In the event the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined  that any Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (i) the  Company shall promptly notify Parent thereof and (ii) for
a period of five  business days after delivery of such notice, the Company
and its  Representatives, if requested by Parent, shall negotiate in good
faith with  Parent to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this  Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with the Merger on
such  adjusted terms. After such five business day period, the Board of 
Directors of the Company may then (and only then) withdraw or modify its 
approval or recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement and recommend 
such Superior Proposal.   (e) The Company agrees not to release any Third
Party from, or waive  any provision of, any standstill agreement to which it
is a party or any  confidentiality agreement between it and another Person
who has made, or  who may reasonably be considered likely to make, an
Acquisition Proposal or  who the Company or any of its Representatives have
had discussions with  regarding a proposed, potential or contemplated Company
Acquisition  Transaction unless the Company\'s Board of Directors shall
conclude, in good  faith, that such action will lead to a Superior Proposal
and that, after  receiving advice from outside legal counsel to the Company,
such action is  required for the Board of Directors to comply with its
fiduciary duties  under applicable law.   (f) For purposes of this
Agreement:   (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the 
--------------------  Company, any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Third Party  relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a  business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that
constitutes  15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or
assets of  the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition  or purchase of 15% or more   51    of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the  consolidated net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its  Subsidiaries, (C) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated  would result in any Person beneficially owning 15%
or more of the  capital stock of the Company, or (D) merger, consolidation,
business  combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar  transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose 
business constitutes 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net 
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   (ii) Each of the
transactions referred to in clauses (A) through  (D) of the definition of
Acquisition Proposal, other than any such  transaction to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, is  referred to herein as a "Company
Acquisition Transaction."  -------------------------------   (iii)
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written offer made 
-----------------  by a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for
consideration  consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the Common Shares
then  outstanding or all or substantially all the assets of the Company (i) 
on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its  good
faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of  nationally
recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms  and conditions
of the offer deemed relevant by such Board of  Directors, including any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement  provisions, conditions to consummation,
and the ability of the party  making such proposal to obtain financing for
such offer) are  materially more favorable from a financial point of view to
its  stockholders than the Merger; and (ii) that constitutes a transaction 
that, in such Board of Directors\' judgment, is reasonably likely to be 
consummated on the terms set forth, taking into account all legal, 
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.   (g) Except as
expressly permitted by Section 6.2(d), neither the Board  --------------  of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or 
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to 
Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors of this 
Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly  to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Company Acquisition 
Transaction. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the 
-----------  Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.   6.3 Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall take all action 
---------------------------- necessary in accordance with applicable law and
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to convene, and will convene, a
meeting of its stockholders (the  "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly
as practicable to consider and vote ---------------------------- upon the
approval of the Merger. Subject only to Section 6.2(d), the Board of 
-------------- Directors of the Company   52   shall recommend and shall
declare advisable such approval (the "Company  ------- Stockholder
Approval"). Unless the Board of Directors of the Company
has -------------------- withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement in
compliance herewith, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger and to secure the vote or consent of
stockholders required by the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger.   6.4
Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. Parent will, as promptly as 
-------------------------------------- practicable, prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "S-4 Registration Statement"),
containing a proxy statement/prospectus, in 
-------------------------- connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the issuance of the Parent Shares upon conversion of the
Company Shares and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
and Parent will, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a
proxy statement that will be the same proxy statement/prospectus contained in
the S-4 Registration Statement and a form of proxy, in connection with the
vote of the Company\'s stockholders with respect to the Merger (such proxy
statement/prospectus, together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, in each case in the form or forms mailed to the Company\'s
stockholders, is herein called the "Proxy Statement"). The Company 
--------------- and Parent will, and will cause their accountants and lawyers
to, use their reasonable best efforts to have or cause the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable, including, without
limitation, causing their accountants to deliver necessary or required
instruments such as opinions, consents and certificates, and will take any
other action required or necessary to be taken under federal or state
securities laws or otherwise in connection with the registration process. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable date and will
coordinate and cooperate with Parent with respect to the timing of the
Company Stockholder Meeting and will use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the date hereof.
Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under state blue sky
or other securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in
the Merger.   6.5 Listing Application. Parent shall as soon as practicable
prepare and  ------------------- submit to the NYSE a listing application
with respect to the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for
the listing of such Parent Shares on such exchange, subject to official
notice of issuance.   6.6 Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and  --------------------- shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives of Parent (the "Authorized 
---------- Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the --------------- period prior to the Effective Time, to its
properties, assets, books and records and, during such period, shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Authorized
Representatives all information concerning their business, properties, assets
and personnel as may reasonably be requested for purposes of appropriate and
necessary due   53   diligence, provided that no investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.6 shall  ----------- affect or be deemed to modify any of
the representations or warranties made by the Company. The Company
acknowledges that Parent may request full and complete access and cooperation
of the Company and its personnel for additional due diligence with regards to
Direct Contracts and Subcontracts of the Company, and agrees to provide any
support and to take any actions reasonably requested by Parent in this
regard. Parent agrees to treat (and cause its Authorized Representatives to
treat) any and all information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 in
strict compliance with the terms of that certain Non-
Disclosure ----------- Agreement, entered by and between the Company and
Parent, dated September 22, 1999 (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"). 
------------------------   6.7 Publicity. The Parties agree that they will
