 \t\tARTICLE I \t

 \t

 \t\tTHE TENDER OFFER \t

 \t  \t\tSECTION 1.1 _The Offer_. \t

 \t  \t\t(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not \t\thave been
terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Merger Sub shall, and \t\tParent
shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable \t\tfollowing the execution of this Agreement, and in any event
within ten (10) \t\tBusiness Days following the date of this Agreement,
commence (within the \t\tmeaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as \t\tamended (the " _Exchange \t\tAct_ ")) the Offer to

Tender Offer \t\tConditions, equal to the Per Share Amount. The Per Share
Amount shall be net to \t\tthe holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction
only for any applicable \t\twithholding or stock transfer Taxes payable by or
with respect to such holder. \t\tThe obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept \t\tfor payment and to pay for any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be \t\tsubject to only those
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ \t\t(the " _Tender Offer \t\tConditions_
").  \t

 \t  \t\t(b) Parent on behalf of Merger Sub expressly \t\treserves the
right from time to time, subject to Sections 1.1(c) and 1.1(d), to \t\twaive
any Tender Offer Condition and increase the Per Share Amount, \t\t _provided_
that without the prior written consent of the Company, \t\tMerger Sub shall
not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to \t\t(i) decrease the Per Share
Amount or change the form of consideration \t\tpayable in the Offer, (ii)
decrease the number of Shares sought to be \t\tpurchased in the Offer, (iii)
amend or waive satisfaction of the Minimum \t\tCondition (as defined in
_Annex I_), \t\t(iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (v) modify
or amend \t\tthe Tender Offer Conditions (other than to waive such Tender
Offer Conditions \t\t(other than the Minimum Condition)) or (vi) modify or
amend any other term \t\tof the Offer, in the case of this clause (vi), in
any manner (A) adverse \t\tto the holders of Shares or (B) which would
reasonably be expected to \t\tresult in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse \t\tEffect. \t

 \t  \t\t(c) On the date of commencement of the \t\tOffer, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a \t\tTender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and \t\tsupplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer which shall contain
or \t\tincorporate by reference the offer to purchase (the " _Offer \t\tto
Purchase_ ") and related letter \t\tof transmittal and summary advertisement
and other ancillary Offer documents \t\tand instruments pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (collectively with any \t\tsupplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each
agrees \t\tto promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer \t\tDocuments if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in \t\tany material respect and Merger Sub shall, and Parent
further agrees to cause \t\tMerger Sub to, use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Schedule TO, as so \t\tcorrected or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and the Offer Documents, as \t\tso corrected or supplemented, to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each \t\tcase as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The \t\tCompany and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and \t\tcomment on
any Offer Documents (including each amendment or supplement
thereto) \t\tbefore they are filed with the SEC. Merger Sub shall, and Parent
agrees to \t\tcause Merger Sub to, provide the Company with (in writing, if
written), and to \t\tconsult with the Company regarding, any comments
(written or oral) that may \t\tbe \t

 \t  \t\t  \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t

 \t

 \t\t2 \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t  \t

 \t   \t

 \t\treceived by Parent, Merger Sub or their \t\tcounsel from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents as \t\tpromptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. The Company and its counsel \t\tshall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral \t\tcomments and
proposed responses. \t

 \t  \t\t(d) The Offer to Purchase shall provide for \t\tan expiration date
of the 20th Business Day (as defined in Rule 14d-1 \t\tunder the Exchange
Act, " _Business \t\tDay_ ") following (and including the \t\tday of) the
commencement of the Offer (such date, or such subsequent date to \t\twhich
the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance \t\twith the terms of this agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Merger Sub shall not, and Parent agrees that it \t\tshall cause Merger Sub
not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in \t\tconnection with the
effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with \t\tSection 8.1
hereof. Except as provided in this Section 1.1(d), Merger Sub shall \t\tnot,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, extend or delay the
Expiration \t\tDate (or expiration time) without the prior written consent of
the Company. \t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub and Parent may,
without receiving the \t\tconsent of the Company, extend the Expiration Date
for any period required by \t\tapplicable rules and regulations of the SEC or
the NASDAQ Global Market (the \t\t" _NASDAQ_ "). So long as the Offer and
this Agreement have \t\tnot been terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, if at
any scheduled Expiration \t\tDate, the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have
been satisfied or earlier \t\twaived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the \t\tOffer and the Expiration Date to a date
that is at least ten (10) Business Days \t\tand no more than fifteen (15)
Business Days after such previously scheduled \t\tExpiration Date (or such
other period of time to which the Company may consent \t\tin writing);
_provided_ that Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent \t\tshall not
be required to cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer more than once \t\tafter
all the conditions to the Offer, other than the Minimum Condition,
shall \t\thave been met. In the event the Acceptance Date occurs but Parent
does not \t\tacquire a number of Shares sufficient to enable a Short Form
Merger to occur \t\t(assuming exercise of the Top-Up Option in full), Merger
Sub may provide one or \t\tmore "subsequent offering periods" for the Offer
in accordance with \t\tRule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act for a number of
days to be determined \t\tby Parent which shall be not less than three (3)
nor more than twenty (20) \t\tBusiness Days in the aggregate. \t

 \t  \t\t(e) Subject solely to the satisfaction or \t\twaiver (to the
extent permitted by this Agreement) by Merger Sub of the Tender \t\tOffer
Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
as \t\tsoon as possible after the Expiration Date, accept for payment Shares
validly \t\ttendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of
acceptance for \t\tpayment, the " _Acceptance \t\tDate_ ," and the time of
acceptance \t\tfor payment on the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ")
and thereafter promptly pay for such Shares. \t\tParent shall or shall cause
Merger Sub to provide or cause to be provided to \t\tthe Paying Agent on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares \t\tthat Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. In the \t\tevent that
Merger Sub and Parent shall provide for a "subsequent offering \t\tperiod"
pursuant to Rule 14a-11, the Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall \t\tcause
Merger Sub to, immediately accept and promptly pay for all
Shares \t\ttendered during each such "subsequent offering period," in each
case \t\tin accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. \t

the \t\tCompany concurrently with (and in the same mailing envelope as) the
Offer \t\tDocuments. The Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the determinations and
approvals \t\treferenced in Section 1.2(a)(iii) and, unless and until any
Change of \t\tRecommendation has taken place in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, \t\tthe Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the Recommendation. The
Company agrees to \t\tpromptly correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall \t\tbecome false or misleading in any material respect
(and each of Parent and \t\tMerger Sub, with respect to written information
supplied by it specifically for \t\tuse in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly
notify the Company of any \t\trequired corrections of such information and
cooperate with the Company with \t\trespect to correcting such information)
and to supplement the information \t\tcontained in the Schedule 14D-9 to
include any information that shall \t\tbecome necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the \t\tcircumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and the Company shall \t\tuse reasonable best efforts
to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected or \t\tsupplemented to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys \t\tstockholders to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. \t\tParent and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and \t\tcomment on the
Schedule 14D-9 (including each amendment or supplement \t\tthereto) before it
is filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent and \t\tMerger Sub
(in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and Merger
Sub \t\tregarding, any comments (written or oral) the Company or its counsel
may \t\treceive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
as \t\tpromptly as practicable after receipt of such comments. Parent and its
counsel \t\tshall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written and oral \t\tcomments and proposed responses. \t

 \t  \t\t(c) In connection with the Offer, the \t\tCompany shall reasonably

 \t

 \t\t  \t  \t

 \t   \t

 \t\tinformation, including updated lists of \t\tstockholders and mailing
labels, and such other information and assistance as \t\tMerger Sub or its
agents may reasonably request for the purpose of \t\tcommunicating the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. \t

 \t  \t\tSECTION 1.3 _Directors_. Effective upon the acceptance for payment
by Parent or \t\tMerger Sub for all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
which represent at \t\tleast a majority of the Shares outstanding, and from
time to time thereafter as \t\tShares are acquired by Parent or Merger Sub,
Parent shall be entitled to \t\tdesignate such number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the \t\tBoard of Directors as will give
Parent, subject to compliance with Section \t\t14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, \t\trepresentation on the Board of
Directors equal to at least that number of \t\tdirectors which equals the
product of the total number of directors on the \t\tBoard of Directors
(giving effect to the directors appointed or elected \t\tpursuant to this
sentence and including current directors serving as officers \t\tof the
Company and to the number of the Independent Directors specified
below) \t\tmultiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially \t\towned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including for
purposes of this \t\tSection 1.3 such Shares as are accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer, but \t\texcluding Shares held by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries) bears to the \t\tnumber of Shares outstanding; _provided_
, \t\t _however_ , that, in the event that Parents designees
are \t\tappointed or elected to the Board of Directors, until the Effective
Time the \t\tBoard of Directors shall have at least two (2) directors who are
directors on \t\tthe date hereof who are neither officers of the Company nor
designees, \t\tstockholders, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of
the federal \t\tsecurities laws) of Parent (one or more of such directors,
the \t\t" _Independent \t\tDirectors_ "); _provided \t\tfurther_ , that if
there is in office \t\tonly one Independent Director, the Board of Directors
will take all reasonable \t\taction necessary to cause a person designated by
the remaining Independent \t\tDirector to fill such vacancy who shall be
neither an officer of the Company \t\tnor a designee, stockholder, affiliate
or associate of Parent, and such person \t\tshall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, \t\tor, if no
Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate
two \t\tpersons to fill the vacancies who shall be neither an officer of the
Company \t\tnor a designee, stockholder, affiliate or associate of Parent,
and each such \t\tperson shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for
purposes of this \t\tAgreement. At each such time, the Company will, subject
to any limitations \t\timposed by applicable law, also cause (a) each
committee of the Board of \t\tDirectors, (b) the board of directors of each
of the Company subsidiaries \t\tand (c) each committee of such board of
directors of each of the Company \t\tsubsidiaries to include persons
designated by Parent constituting the same \t\tpercentage of each such
committee or board as Parents designees \t\tconstitute on the Board of
Directors. The Company shall take all reasonable \t\taction necessary to
cause Parents designees to be so elected including, \t\tupon request by
Parent, subject to the Companys Certificate of \t\tIncorporation, promptly
to increase the size of the Board of Directors or \t\texercise its best
efforts to secure the resignations of such number of \t\tdirectors as is
necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to \t\tthe Board of
Directors in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.3. \t\tSubject to
applicable law, and subject to Parent supplying the Company with
the \t\tinformation with respect to itself and its nominees, officers,
directors and \t\taffiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 \t\tpromulgated thereunder within five (5) Business Days after

necessary pursuant \t\tto Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill
its obligations under \t\tthis Section 1.3 and shall mail to the Companys
stockholders no later \t\tthan ten (10) days prior to the initial Expiration
Date of the Offer such \t\tinformation with respect to the Company and its
officers \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t

 \t

 \t\t5 \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t  \t

 \t   \t

 \t\tand directors as is required under Section \t\t14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under this \t\tSection 1.3. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, \t\tfollowing the time directors
designated by Parent are elected or appointed to \t\tthe Board of Directors
and prior to the Effective Time, if there are any \t\tIndependent Directors
on the Board of Directors of the Company, the affirmative \t\tvote of a
majority of the Independent Directors (or the vote of the
sole \t\tIndependent Director if there remains only one Independent Director)
shall be \t\trequired to (v) authorize any amendments to the Certificate
of \t\tIncorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (w) amend or terminate
this \t\tAgreement on behalf of the Company, (x) waive any of the
Companys \t\trights or remedies hereunder, (y) extend the time for
performance of \t\tParents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder, or (z)
take any other \t\taction by the Company in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions \t\tcontemplated hereby required to be taken by the
Board of Directors. The \t\tIndependent Directors shall have the authority to
retain counsel (which may \t\tinclude current counsel to the Company) at the
reasonable expense of the \t\tCompany as determined appropriate by the
Independent Directors for the purpose \t\tof fulfilling their obligations
hereunder. \t

 \t  \t\tSECTION 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. \t

 \t  \t\t(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to \t\tMerger Sub an
option (the " _Top-Up \t\tOption_ "), exercisable upon the \t\tterms and
conditions set forth in this Section 1.4, to purchase up to that \t\tnumber
of Shares (the " _Top-Up \t\tOption Shares_ ") equal to the \t\tlowest
number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares directly
or \t\tindirectly owned by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of such exercise,
shall \t\tconstitute one thousand shares more than 90% of the Shares
outstanding \t\timmediately after exercise of the Top-Up Option at a price
per share as set \t\tforth below; _provided_ that in no event shall the Top-
Up Option be exercisable \t\tfor a number of Shares in excess of the
Companys then authorized but \t\tunissued Shares (less the number of such
Shares reserved for issuance in \t\trespect of vested Company Stock Options,
warrants and convertible securities \t\toutstanding immediately prior to the
expiration of the Offer with an exercise \t\tprice less than the Per Share
Amount). The purchase price for the Top-Up Option \t\tShares shall be equal
to the Per Share Amount, which price shall be payable in \t\tcash in an
amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up \t\tOption
Shares and by the issuance of a full recourse note with a
principal \t\tamount equal to the remainder of the exercise price. Any such
note shall bear \t\tinterest at the rate of the one-year LIBOR rate in effect
at the time of \t\tissuance of the note and shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of \t\texecution and delivery of such note. \t

 \t  \t\t(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by \t\tMerger Sub at any
time on or after the Acceptance Time (so long as the exercise \t\tof the Top-
Up Option would, after the issuance of Shares thereunder, be \t\tsufficient
to allow the Short Form Merger to occur), and prior to the earlier \t\tto
occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of
this \t\tAgreement in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , \t\t _however_
, that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up \t\tOption Shares upon
the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the \t\tconditions that (A)
no provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation \t\tand no judgment,
injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the \t\tTop-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of
such \t\texercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of
Shares \t\towned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent or \t\tMerger Sub constitutes one thousand Shares more than 90% of the
number of \t\tShares that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance
of the Top-Up \t\tOption Shares, and (C) Merger Sub has accepted \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t

 \t

 \t\t6 \t

 \t

 \t\t  \t  \t

 \t   \t

 \t\tfor payment all Shares validly tendered in \t\tthe Offer and not
withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the \t\tissuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all \t\tapplicable legal
requirements of all Governmental Entities, including \t\tcompliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option \t\tShares under
the Securities Act. \t

 \t  \t\t(c) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option \t\tin accordance with
Section 1.4(a), Parent shall so notify the Company and shall \t\tset forth in
such notice (i) the number of Shares that are expected to be \t\towned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger \t\tSub
immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and \t\t(ii) a
place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option \t\tShares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such \t\tnotice, notify Parent and Merger Sub of the number of
Shares then outstanding \t\tand the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the
closing of the purchase of the \t\tTop-Up Option Shares, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, shall pay the \t\tCompany the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares \t\tpursuant to Section
1.4(a), and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent \t\tor Merger Sub
a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. \t

 \t  \t\t(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that \t\tthe Shares which
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will \t\tnot be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance
upon \t\tan exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. \t\tParent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that
Merger Sub is, \t\tor will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares,
an "accredited \t\tinvestor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under
the \t\tSecurities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-
Up Option \t\tShares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are
being and will be \t\tacquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment
and not with a view to, or \t\tfor resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of \t\tthe Securities Act). \t

(180) days after the Effective Time, Parent shall be \t\tentitled to require

received with respect thereto) which have been made available to

Certificates. The Surviving Corporation shall pay \t\tall charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection \t\twith the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
the \t\tforegoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent shall \t\tbe liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger
Consideration delivered in \t\trespect of such Share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, \t\tescheat or other similar law. \t

 \t  \t\t(d) After the Effective Time, the stock \t\ttransfer books of the

Shares \t\toutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any \t\trights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by \t\tapplicable law. After the Effective Time, Certificates
presented to the \t\tSurviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and
exchanged for the \t\tconsideration provided for (other than Certificates
representing Shares to be \t\tcancelled pursuant to Section 2.7(b) or the
Dissenting Shares), and in \t\taccordance with the procedures set forth in,
this Article II. \t

 \t  \t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything in this \t\tAgreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the \t\tPaying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration \t\totherwise payable
to any former holder of Shares, Options or Warrants pursuant \t\tto this
Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld \t\twith
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To
the \t\textent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the \t\tPaying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this \t\tAgreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares, Options or Warrants in \t\trespect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Paying \t\tAgent. \t

 \t  \t\t(f) In the event that any Certificate shall \t\thave been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the \t\treplacement
requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if \t\trequested by
Parent, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount
as \t\tindemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving \t\tCorporation with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent

fact that an \t\tIndemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent \t\tof the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii)

(including this Agreement and the \t\ttransactions and actions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed \t\tprior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under \t\tapplicable law. In the event
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or \t\tinvestigation, (x) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement \t\tof expenses incurred in
the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or \t\tinvestigation from

if it is ultimately determined \t\tthat such person is not entitled to
indemnification, (y) the Surviving \t\tCorporation shall not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any \t\tjudgment in any proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, \t\tinvestigation or claim (and in which

unless such settlement, compromise or consent \t\tincludes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability \t\tarising out of such
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such \t\tIndemnified
Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation \t\tshall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. \t

 \t  \t\t(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving \t\tCorporation to keep in
effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from \t\tthe Effective
Time (or, in the case of matters occurring prior to the Effective \t\tTime

to \t\tParent prior to the date hereof that provide for exculpation of
director and \t\tofficer liability and indemnification (and advancement of
expenses related \t\tthereto) of the past and present officers and directors
of the Company to the \t\tfullest extent permitted by Delaware law, and such
provisions shall not be \t\tamended except as either required by applicable
law or to make changes \t\tpermitted by law that would enhance the rights of
past or present officers and \t\tdirectors to indemnification or advancement
of expenses. \t

 \t  \t\t(c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause \t\tthe Surviving
Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in \t\teffect
for six years from the Effective Time the current policies of

the \t\tCompany ( _provided_ that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
substitute \t\ttherefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions \t\twhich are not less advantageous to any beneficiary
thereof from its current \t\tcarrier or another carrier with a rating no
lower than the A.M. Best \t\trating of A) with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the \t\tEffective Time; _provided_ , _however_

 \t\t  \t  \t

 \t   \t

 \t\tin order to maintain or procure such \t\tcoverage, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to \t\tmaintain or obtain
policies providing such coverage except to the extent such \t\tcoverage can
be provided at an annual cost of no greater than two hundred \t\tseventy-five
percent (275%) of the most recent annual premium paid by the \t\tCompany
prior to the date hereof (the " _Cap_ "); and \t\t _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if \t\tequivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only
by paying an \t\tannual premium in excess of the Cap, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall \t\tbe required to only obtain as much coverage as can be
obtained by paying an \t\tannual premium equal to the Cap. \t

 \t  \t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the \t\tcontrary, if any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether \t\tarising before,
at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified \t\tParty on
or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the \t\tprovisions
of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final \t\tdisposition

 \t  \t\t(e) This covenant is intended to be for the \t\tbenefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and \t\ttheir

provided \t\tfor herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an \t\tIndemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract
or \t\totherwise. \t
