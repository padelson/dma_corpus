AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of May 13,
2020, is made by and among (i) Ten-X Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), (ii) CoStar Realty Information, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer"), (iii) Crescendo Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer ("Merger Sub" and, together with the Company,
the "Constituent Corporations"), and (iv) Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund VII, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as representative as
set forth in this Agreement (the "Representative"). Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article XI below.

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the DGCL (the "Merger"), and the board of directors of the Company has
declared that it is advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of
the Company that this Agreement and the Merger be adopted and approved by the
stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, Buyer, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has
approved this Agreement and the Merger;

WHEREAS, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 40,500,000
shares, of which 40,000,000 are shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the "Common Stock") and 500,000 are shares of undesignated Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock");

WHEREAS, the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"),
all of which are issued and outstanding and owned by Buyer; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Representative, as applicable, will receive duly executed copies of each of
the Restrictive Covenant Agreements from each applicable counterparty.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.01 The Merger. On and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein,
and in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with (i) the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub thereupon ceasing and (ii) the Company surviving the
Merger as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer (the Company, as



the surviving corporation after the Effective Time, is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

1.02 Filing of Merger Certificate; Effective Time. At the Closing, subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Article VII, (i) the
Company will execute a certificate of merger in substantially the form of
Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and (ii) the Company and Merger Sub will, and Buyer
will cause Merger Sub to, cause such executed Certificate of Merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the DGCL, and the Merger will be effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as may be agreed in writing by Buyer and the Company and
specified therein (the "Effective Time").

1.03 Effect of the Merger; Further Assurances.

(a) The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation determines that any
further documents or acts are necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation
the title to any properties, rights, privileges, powers or franchises of the
Constituent Corporations acquired in the Merger or to otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its officers and
directors will execute and deliver all such documents and do all such acts,
and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of the Constituent Corporations or otherwise to take
any and all such action after the Effective Time solely for the purposes set
forth in this Section 1.03.

(b) At the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation of the Company
will, by operation of law and without any further action by any Person, be
amended and restated in its entirety to contain the provisions set forth in
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except for any references to the name, incorporator or
original directors of Merger Sub), and as so amended and restated will be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended or repealed in accordance with the provisions thereof, and applicable
Law.

(c) At the Effective Time the bylaws of the Company will, by operation of law
and without any further action by any Person, be amended and restated in their
entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for any references to
the name of Merger Sub), and as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance
with the provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and applicable Law.

(d) The directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified in the manner provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their
earlier resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law.



(e) Other than as specified in writing by Buyer at least two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing, the officers of the Company in office immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors are duly elected and qualified in the manner provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their
earlier resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

1.04 Conversion of Shares; Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the securities described below:

(a) Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one (1) validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock cancelled pursuant to
Section 1.04(c) and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to
receive the Closing Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration plus any
amount payable with respect to such share of Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.07(f), as applicable, and will automatically be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist. The amount of cash each Stockholder is entitled to
receive with respect to his, her or its shares of Common Stock shall be
rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts
for all shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder.

(c) Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Common Stock owned or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or
by Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no payment of cash or
any other consideration will be made with respect thereto.

(d) Each unexercised Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is or becomes a Vested Option at the Closing will, as of the
Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive the Closing Option Per
Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.06 plus any amount
payable with respect to such Option pursuant to Section 1.07(f) (as
applicable), in each case, subject to any applicable Tax withholding pursuant
to Section 1.09, and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will
cease to exist. Each Option that is not and does not become a Vested Option as
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence shall be cancelled and
retired and cease to exist effective as of the Effective Time, with no
consideration therefor. The amount of cash each Optionholder is entitled to
receive with respect to his or her Vested Options shall be rounded down to the
nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Options held
by such Optionholder. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to (i) terminate the Option Plan as of the Effective Time such that
no Optionholder shall have any rights thereunder, including any rights to
acquire any equity securities of the Company, other than as set forth herein,
and (ii) ensure that neither the Company nor Buyer will, as of the Closing, be
bound by any rights under the Option Plan or any other plan, program, or
arrangement (or provision thereof) for the issuance or grant of any interest
in respect of any equity interests of the Company. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall take all actions necessary and sufficient to give effect to



the actions contemplated by this Section 1.04(d) in accordance with applicable
Law, and as applicable, the Option Plan and each agreement evidencing a grant
of Options, in each case, including obtaining necessary consents and obtaining
approval of the Company\'s board of directors; provided, that such actions
shall be expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and shall
be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing
pursuant to Article VIII. As soon as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall send to each holder of an Option a customary
waiver agreement (which may be distributed by the Company\'s software
application pertaining to Options) describing the treatment of and payment for
such Option pursuant to this Section 1.04(d), and providing instructions for
obtaining payment for such Option following the Effective Time, which payment
shall be conditioned on such holder executing such waiver agreement (in a form
mutually agreed to by Buyer and the Representative acting reasonably)
providing for a customary waiver of Liabilities relating to such Option (other
than the right to receive payment in respect thereof pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement).

1.05 Pre-Closing Merger Consideration Estimate.

(a) At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will
prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth a calculation of (1) the estimated Closing
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), (2) the
estimated Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (3) the estimated
Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (4) the estimated
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"), (5) the
Company\'s calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration derived from the
foregoing, (6) the Closing Stock Payment payable at the Closing to each
Stockholder in accordance with Section 1.05(b), and (7) the Closing Option
Payment payable at the Closing to each Optionholder in accordance with Section
1.05(c). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing
Statement will be prepared, and the Estimated Closing Cash, the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction Expenses will be
determined, in each case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance
with GAAP and the definitions set forth in this Agreement, using, solely to
the extent consistent with GAAP, the same accounting methods, assumptions,
policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the
preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet except that the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with Exhibit B using, solely
to the extent consistent with GAAP, the same accounting methods, assumptions,
policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the
preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet. Following the delivery of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Company shall, upon the written request of Buyer, provide Buyer and its
accountants with reasonable supporting documentation for the calculations
included therein and make the relevant financial records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries relating thereto reasonably available to Buyer and its
accountants in connection therewith.

(b) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Stockholder will be
entitled to receive at the Closing to be set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement in respect



of his, her or its shares of Common Stock (the "Closing Stock Payment") will
equal the product of (i) Closing Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time that were converted in
accordance with Section 1.04(b).

(c) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Optionholder will
be entitled to receive at the Closing to be set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement in respect of his or her Options (the "Closing Option Payment") will
equal the product of (i) Closing Option Per Share Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock corresponding to the
Vested Options held by such Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time that were converted in accordance with Section 1.04(d).

1.06 Closing Payments.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Closing Stock Payments payable to the Stockholders
as set forth in the Spreadsheet and the Estimated Closing Statement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Paying Agent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver the
aggregate Closing Option Payments payable to the Optionholders as set forth in
the Spreadsheet and the Estimated Closing Statement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company will distribute
to the Optionholders on or prior to the Company\'s next regularly scheduled
payroll date, their respective Closing Option Payments, subject to any
applicable Tax withholding pursuant to Section 1.09. After the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make timely payment to the
appropriate taxing authority or authorities of any amounts withheld from
payment to the Optionholders pursuant to Section 1.09.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver the
Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an escrow account designated by the Escrow
Agent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the
"Adjustment Escrow Account") and established pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement to be dated as of the Closing Date and substantially in the
form attached as Exhibit C (the "Escrow Agreement"), among Buyer, the Company,
the Representative and the Escrow Agent. The Adjustment Escrow Account will be
maintained separately from other funds held by the Escrow Agent and will be
Buyer\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole and exclusive source of recovery for any
amounts owing to Buyer, Merger Sub or, following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 1.07 with
respect to the Adjustment Escrow Funds).

(d) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, to the
Representative, the Representative Holdback Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Representative at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



(e) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all Estimated Transaction Expenses set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement to such Persons as they are owed by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated by the
Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (other than
Transaction Expenses that are compensatory, which will be paid through the
Company\'s payroll as and when due).

(f) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement required to be paid under the payoff letters delivered
pursuant to Section 5.07 in order to fully discharge the Indebtedness owed to
the Persons thereunder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated in such payoff letters.

(g) In accordance with the paying agent agreement to be dated as of the
Closing Date and substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D (the "Paying
Agent Agreement"), the Paying Agent will act as the Representative\'s agent in
delivering to each Stockholder its respective Closing Stock Payment as well as
any amounts owed to such Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.07. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on the cash payable to holders of Common Stock in
accordance with this Article I. It is understood by the parties hereto (but
without liability to any such party) that, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall cause to be
delivered or mailed to each Stockholder of record (other than any holder of
Dissenting Shares) a Letter of Transmittal substantially in the form of
Exhibit E (the "Letter of Transmittal"). At or after the Effective Time, upon
delivery by a Stockholder of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent, (i) the Paying Agent will pay each such Stockholder the Closing
Stock Payment to which such Stockholder is entitled in accordance with the
Spreadsheet and (ii) each Stockholder will be entitled to receive the portion
of any amount payable under Section 1.07(f) with respect to the shares of
Common Stock held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the last sentence of this Section 1.06(g), the Stock Consideration
payable to a Stockholder will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by such Stockholder in the
Letter of Transmittal, unless alternative arrangements are specified by such
holder in the Letter of Transmittal, to the extent permitted by the Letter of
Transmittal. Each such Stockholder that makes the deliveries to the Paying
Agent required by this Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the Paying
Agent Agreement prior to the Closing Date will be paid his, her or its Closing
Stock Payment on the same Business Day as the Effective Time, or as soon as
possible thereafter. Each such Stockholder that makes the deliveries to the
Paying Agent required by this Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the
Paying Agent Agreement thereafter will be paid his, her or its Closing Stock
Payment as soon as possible after delivery thereof is made (but in any event
no later than two (2) Business Days after the date such delivery thereof is
made). After Buyer delivers the aggregate Closing Stock Payments to the Paying
Agent as required under Section 1.06(a), each Stockholder will be entitled to
look only to the Paying Agent (or, solely if applicable under Section 1.06(h),
the Surviving Corporation) for any payments due and payable to such
Stockholder as of the Closing following the delivery of such Stockholder\'s
duly executed Letter of Transmittal pursuant to this Agreement. If any
transfer of ownership of shares of Common Stock has not been registered in the
Company\'s transfer records, payment may be made to a Person other



than the registered owner only in accordance with the requirements described
in the Letter of Transmittal.

(h) At any time that is more than one (1) year after the Effective Time, Buyer
may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Corporation any
portion of the Stock Consideration (including any earnings thereon) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and that has not been disbursed to
Stockholders as of such first anniversary (other than any amounts then subject
to dispute). After the Paying Agent makes such payments to the Surviving
Corporation, all former Stockholders will be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the cash
payable upon delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Paying Agent will have no further obligation under
this Section 1.06 in its capacity as such. None of the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Representative or the Paying Agent will be liable to
any Person in respect of amounts paid to a public official to the extent
required under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any amounts payable in accordance with this Article I would otherwise escheat
to any Governmental Body, then any such amounts immediately prior to the date
on which such amounts would otherwise escheat to any Governmental Body, shall
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no further registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be
made on the books and records of the Company. Additionally, all cash paid to a
former holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of such shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the applicable shares of
Common Stock.

1.07 Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment. Following the Closing Date,
the Merger Consideration will be adjusted, if at all, dollar-for-dollar as set
forth below:

(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Representative within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the "Closing Balance
Sheet") and (ii) a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth a
calculation of (1) the Closing Net Working Capital, (2) the Closing Cash, (3)
the Closing Indebtedness, (4) the Transaction Expenses, (5) Buyer\'s
calculation of the Final Merger Consideration derived from the foregoing, and
(6) with respect to each of the foregoing, the changes in such amounts from
the corresponding amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement. The Closing
Balance Sheet and Closing Statement will be prepared, and the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be determined, in each
case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP and the
definitions set forth in this Agreement, using, solely to the extent
consistent with GAAP, the same accounting methods, assumptions, policies,
principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the
Latest Balance Sheet except that the Closing Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with Exhibit B using, solely to the extent consistent
with GAAP, the same accounting methods, assumptions, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology, as were



used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Statement (i) will not include any changes in assets or
liabilities solely as a result of implementing purchase accounting adjustments
and (ii) except as required by GAAP will be based on facts and circumstances
as they exist as of the Adjustment Calculation Time and will exclude the
effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing. The
parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and calculating Final Merger Consideration is solely to (x)
accurately measure the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses and (y) measure the difference in
Closing Net Working Capital from Target Net Working Capital, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different accounting
methods or practices, reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for
the purpose of calculating Final Merger Consideration than were used in the
calculation of Estimated Merger Consideration, assuming the methodologies used
in calculating Estimated Merger Consideration were in accordance with GAAP.

(b) On or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day following Buyer\'s delivery of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, the Representative may
give Buyer a written notice stating in reasonable detail the Representative\'s
objections (a "Notice of Disagreement") to the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement. During such 45‑day period, and any period of dispute
thereafter with respect to such Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing
Statement, Buyer will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
provide the Representative and its Advisors reasonable access to the books,
records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents),
supporting data, facilities, and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Company personnel responsible for accounting and finance and senior
management) and, subject to execution of any customary work paper access
letters required by them, the Company\'s accountants and their work papers,
and (ii) otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the Representative and
its Advisors in connection with such review, in each case during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company\'s business. Any
determination set forth on the Closing Statement which is not specifically
objected to in the Notice of Disagreement will be deemed acceptable to the
Representative, and will be final and binding upon all parties upon delivery
of the Notice of Disagreement. If the Representative does not deliver to Buyer
a Notice of Disagreement within such 45‑day period, then the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be final and binding
upon the parties as of the expiration of such 45-day period, and the Final
Merger Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement will constitute the
Final Merger Consideration for all purposes of this Section 1.07.

(c) Following Buyer\'s receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, the
Representative and Buyer will attempt to negotiate in good faith to resolve
the disputed matters set forth therein, and all such discussions and
negotiations related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the
Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any applicable similar state
rule. In the event that the Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of
the Representative\'s proposed adjustments set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Notice of
Disagreement, the Representative and Buyer agree to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to



cause BDO USA, LLP (provided that if BDO USA, LLP is unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, the Representative and Buyer shall jointly select an
alternative firm that is a nationally recognized independent accounting or
valuation firm) (the "Firm"), within 45 days immediately following such first
30‑day period, to make the final written determination of all matters which
remain in dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer and
the Representative will instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make a final
determination of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) solely in
accordance with this Agreement. Buyer and the Representative will execute a
customary engagement letter and will cooperate with the Firm during the term
of its engagement. Buyer and the Representative will instruct the Firm not to,
and the Firm will not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other
hand. Buyer and the Representative will also instruct the Firm to, and the
Firm will, make its determination based solely on written submissions by Buyer
and the Representative that are in accordance with this Agreement (i.e., not
on the basis of an independent review). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each case, as determined by the Firm
in accordance with this Section 1.07(c), will be final and binding on the
parties on the date the Firm delivers its final determination in writing to
Buyer and the Representative. The date on which the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Closing Statement and the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses are finally determined pursuant
to Section 1.07(b), are agreed upon by Buyer and the Representative pursuant
to this Section 1.07(c) or are determined by the Firm in accordance with this
Section 1.07(c) is referred to as the "Settlement Date." The fees, costs and
expenses of the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total
amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the Representative submits
a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Representative, and if the Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Representative $300 of the $500 contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer
and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Representative.

(d) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration (such excess, the "Excess Amount"), Buyer and the Representative
will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (or its designee), within two (2) Business Days
after the Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Excess Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Funds. In the event that at such time
the Excess Amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (such shortfall,
the "Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds"), Buyer and the Representative will
simultaneously with delivery of the instructions in the immediately foregoing
sentence deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment
Escrow Account to the Representative (or its designee), with all such amounts
received by the Representative (or its designee) pursuant to this Section
1.07(d), subject to Section 10.19(b), to be paid to the Stockholders or
Optionholders in accordance with Section 1.07(f).



(e) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (such excess, the "Adjustment Amount"), then (i) Buyer will,
within two (2) Business Days after the Settlement Date, make payment of the
Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Representative (or its designee), and (ii) Buyer and the Representative will
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to make payment of the Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment
Escrow Account, within two (2) Business Days after the Settlement Date, to the
Representative (or its designee), with all such amounts received by the
Representative (or its designee) pursuant to this Section 1.07(e), subject to
Section 10.19(b), to be paid to the Stockholders or Optionholders pursuant to
Section 1.07(f); provided, that in no event shall the Adjustment Amount paid
by Buyer exceed $2,000,000.

(f) When the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.07(b) or Section 1.07(c), the Representative will in good faith
compute or re-compute, as the case may be, (i) the number of Vested Options,
(ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares, (iii) the Aggregate Option
Exercise Price, (iv) the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration, (v) the Final
Common Stock Merger Consideration, (vi) the Final Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration, (vii) the Final Option Per Share Merger Consideration
and (viii) the appropriate amount payable to each Stockholder and Optionholder
based on the foregoing from the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds, the
Adjustment Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount, taking into account
amounts previously received by such Stockholders and Optionholders as Closing
Stock Payments or Closing Option Payments, in each case, in accordance with
this Agreement and the terms of the Option Plan. Promptly thereafter, the
Representative will notify the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, as
applicable, of such calculations and the amount that should be distributed by
them (and, subject to Section 10.19(b), shall ensure that the Paying Agent has
received any amounts paid by Buyer to the Representative or its designee, if
not the Paying Agent, under Section 1.07(d) or Section 1.07(e) to the extent
such amounts are payable to the Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant to
this Agreement) and shall cause the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to pay such amounts owed to each Stockholder and to the Surviving
Corporation on behalf of each Optionholder, based upon the calculations and
re-calculations contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Stockholder and Optionholder will receive the
difference between (x) the amounts payable to such Stockholder or Optionholder
based upon the calculations and re-calculations contemplated by this Section
1.07(f) and (y) the Closing Stock Payment or Closing Option Payment received
at the Closing by such Stockholder or Optionholder, as applicable. The
Representative, the Escrow Agent, the Surviving Corporation, and the Paying
Agent, as applicable, will distribute such amounts, as applicable, in
accordance with the irrevocable written instructions so received from the
Representative. If, at the time of the calculation of Final Adjusted Merger
Consideration, the Representative determines to retain funds in the
Representative Holdback Amount under Section 10.19(b), and at any time and
from time to time thereafter determines a portion of such funds should be
distributed to the Stockholders and Optionholders, then at each such time, the
Representative will in good faith determine the appropriate amounts to be paid
to the Stockholders and Optionholders from the Representative Holdback Amount
(taking into account any changes in Vested Options, Aggregate Option Exercise
Price or Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares necessary based on such
distribution of funds and any prior amounts received as Closing Stock
Payments, Closing Option Payments or under this Section 1.07(f)) and will
cause such amounts to be paid from the Representative Holdback Amount to the



Stockholders and to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Optionholders.
As promptly as practicable following the receipt of funds for the
Optionholders and, in any event, no later than the next scheduled full payroll
cycle of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation will
distribute to the Optionholders any payments received on their behalf under
this Section 1.07(f). None of the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Buyer will have any liability or obligation to any
Stockholder or Optionholder or the Representative for any distribution made in
accordance with the instructions of the Representative pursuant to this
Section 1.07(f), Section 1.06(a) or Section 1.06(b).

(g) The parties hereto agree that any payment made pursuant to this Section
1.07 shall be treated as an adjustment to the aggregate consideration for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

1.08 Appraisal Rights. Each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person
who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, (i) has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed an enforceable waiver
of appraisal rights (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) and
(ii) has properly demanded appraisal of such share of Common Stock, and not
effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal,
will not, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive any
portion of the Stock Consideration and instead will be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist and shall represent only the right to receive payment
from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto as provided by the DGCL,
unless and until the holder of any such share has failed to perfect or has
effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, in which case such share will thereupon be deemed, as of the
Effective Time, to have been cancelled and retired and to have ceased to exist
and been converted into the right to receive, upon delivery of a duly executed
Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this Agreement, the Stock
Consideration without interest. From and after the Effective Time, no
Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote his,
her or its shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on his, her or its shares (except dividends
or other distributions payable to Stockholders of record at a date prior to
the Effective Time). Any shares of Common Stock for which appraisal rights
have been properly exercised, and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or failed
to be perfected, in each case, in accordance with this Section 1.08 and the
DGCL, are referred to in this Agreement as "Dissenting Shares." The Company
will give Buyer (i) prompt notice of (x) any demands for appraisal received by
the Company, including any Stockholder\'s notice of their intent to demand
payment pursuant to the DGCL that the Company receives, and (y) withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to direct all
material negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands referenced
in the foregoing clause (i)(x). Except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to or
settle or offer to settle any such demands or waive any failure by a
Stockholder to timely deliver a written demand or to perform any other act
perfecting appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

1.09 Withholding Rights. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (a) such
amounts that are required



to be deducted and withheld pursuant to any provision of Tax Law, (b) U.S.
federal backup withholding Taxes required under Code Section 3406 to the
extent a Stockholder does not deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or the
Paying Agent a properly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or Form
W-8, as applicable or (c) U.S. federal withholding Taxes required under Code
Section 1445 to the extent the Company does not deliver to Buyer the
certificate required under Section 2.02(c)(ii). To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and timely remitted in full to the applicable Tax authority by
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. In the
event that Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent determines that
withholding from the Merger Consideration is required under applicable Tax Law
and permitted under this Agreement (other than withholding with respect to
Options), Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent will promptly so
notify the Representative, on behalf of the recipient of such payment, to
provide such recipient with a reasonable opportunity to provide any form or
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding and
will otherwise cooperate in good faith with the Representative and such
recipient to mitigate such withholding. If Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Paying Agent withholds any amount from any Stockholder or Optionholder
which it was not required to withhold, it will promptly remit to the
Stockholder or Optionholder thereof such amount wrongly withheld.

(a) Attached to Schedule 3.06(a) are complete and correct copies of: (i) the
stand-alone unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2020 (the
"Latest Balance Sheet"), and the related stand-alone unaudited statement of
income for the three-month period then ended, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Most Recent Financial Statements"), (ii) the
stand-alone unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, and
the related stand-alone unaudited statement of income and cash flows for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the

"Company Unaudited Financial Statements" and, collectively with the Most
Recent Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements"). The calculations,
judgments, principles and adjustments used in preparing, and the underlying
balances set forth in, the Financial Statements were prepared in accordance
with GAAP, consistently applied (other than footnotes required by GAAP and
other than, in the case of the Most Recent Financial Statements, for the
absence of year-end notes). The 2018 Unaudited Statement of Income has been
prepared in good faith based upon the Company\'s reasonable estimates,
assumptions and judgments as to the financial performance of the business of

results of operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
operated as a standalone business and not as part of a consolidated



group, as of the period then ended. The Most Recent Financial Statements and
the 2019 Unaudited Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects (i) the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date thereof and (ii) the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal periods covered
thereby.

consistent with past practice and which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) Liabilities to be included in the computation of Closing Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses, (iv) Liabilities to be included in the computation of
Closing Net Working Capital, and (v) other Liabilities which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. This representation will not be deemed breached
as a result of a change in applicable Law, the Code or GAAP after the Closing.

(c) The Company has in place appropriate systems and processes (including the
maintenance of proper books and records) designed to (i) provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of the Financial Statements and (ii) in a
timely manner accumulate and communicate to the Company\'s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer the type of information that would be
required to be disclosed in the Financial Statements (such systems and
processes being herein referred to as the "Financial Controls"). The Company
has in place a revenue recognition policy consistent with GAAP. Neither the
Company, its officers nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, the Company\'s
independent accountants, has identified or been made aware of any complaint,
allegation, deficiency, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the Financial Controls or the Financial Statements that has not been resolved.
To the Company\'s knowledge, there have been no instances of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation in the preparation of the Financial Statements,
in connection with the Financial Controls of the Company or otherwise by any
employee, whether or not material, that occurred during any period covered by
the Financial Statements.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries has, in the past six (6) years, infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated, and does not infringe, misappropriate
or otherwise violate, any Intellectual Property of any other Person. As of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is the
subject of any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened Legal
Proceedings alleging any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
any Person\'s Intellectual Property by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (ii) in the past six (6) years has received any notice or claim challenging
the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Owned Intellectual
Property (other than office actions issued by the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, or corresponding foreign Governmental Body, in the ordinary
course of prosecution of any Scheduled Intellectual Property), and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any particular Owned
Intellectual Property.

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, and except as set forth on Schedule
3.13(d), (i) no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated in

Person in the past three (3) years by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

the Intellectual Property necessary and sufficient to enable the Company and
its Subsidiaries to conduct the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the manner in which such business is currently being conducted, (ii) upon
the consummation of the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have
all of the Intellectual Property rights necessary for the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and all
of such rights shall be exercisable by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
same extent as by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the

Property that is material to the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as presently conducted, and no trade secret of any third party
with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a
confidentiality obligation, has been authorized to be disclosed or has been
actually disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of its or
their former or current employees or any other Person other than pursuant to a
valid written agreement restricting, to the extent reasonable under the
circumstances, the disclosure and use of such material trade secret. All
current and former employees, consultants and independent contractors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have created, developed or conceived
Owned Intellectual Property for or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or who have had access to material trade secrets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have executed valid written agreements pursuant to which
such Persons have (i) agreed to hold all trade secrets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in confidence both during and after their employment or
engagement, as applicable, and (ii) presently assigned to the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries all of such Person\'s rights, title and interest in and to
all Intellectual Property created, developed or conceived for the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the course of their employment or engagement by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no party
to any such agreements is in default or breach in any material respect of any
such agreements.

(g) Except with respect to services or rights contemplated to be provided
under the License Agreement, the Company owns or has a valid right to access
and use all computer systems, networks, hardware, Software, databases,
websites, and equipment used to process, store, maintain and operate data and
information used in connection with the business of the Company



and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted (the "Company IT Systems"). The
Company IT Systems (i) are adequate for, and operate and perform in all
material respects as required in connection with, the operation of the
business of the Company of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and (ii)
do not, to the knowledge of the Company, contain any viruses, worms, trojan
horses, bugs, faults or other devices, errors, contaminants or effects that
(A) materially disrupt or materially adversely affect the functionality of any
Company IT Systems, except as disclosed in the written documentation for such
Company IT Systems, or (B) enable or assist any Person to access without
authorization any Company IT Systems.

(h) No source code of any Software that constitutes Owned Intellectual
Property ("Owned Software") has been licensed or otherwise provided to any
third Person other than to consultants and contractors performing work on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who are bound by valid
written agreements restricting the disclosure and use of such source code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has disclosed or delivered to
any escrow agent or any other Person (other than the consultants and
contractors described in the previous sentence) any of the source code of any
Owned Software, and no such Persons have the right, contingent or otherwise,
to obtain access to or use any such source code.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (a) distributed any
Open Source Materials in conjunction with or for use with any Owned Software;
or (b) used any Open Source Materials in any manner that obligates the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose, make available, offer or deliver any
portion of the source code of any Owned Software to any third Person. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has used any Open Source Materials in
any manner that (i) transfers the rights of ownership in any Owned Software or
Intellectual Property rights therein to any third Person; (ii) limits the
Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' freedom of action with respect to the
use or distribution of any Owned Software; or (iii) requires the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to permit any third Person to reverse engineer or
replace portions of any Owned Software. All use and distribution of any Open
Source Materials by the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects with all licenses applicable thereto, including all
copyright notice and attribution requirements.

(j) The Company and each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries has complied in all
material respects with (i) all applicable privacy policies of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) all Privacy Laws, including by providing notice and
obtaining consent to the extent required by applicable Privacy Laws and (iii)
all Material Contracts that the Company or any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries
has entered into with respect to the receipt, collection, compilation, use
storage, processing, sharing, safeguarding, security, disposal, destruction,

Proceeding currently pending against the Company or any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries with respect to non-compliance with Privacy Laws.

Information from loss, unauthorized access or other misuse. None of the



Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other Person has made any illegal or unauthorized use of any Personal
Information collected by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries in a manner that is in violation in any material respect with
Privacy Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries have disaster recovery and
business continuity plans and take actions reasonably consistent with such
plans in accordance with their reasonable judgment to safeguard the Personal
Information in their possession or control.

(l) To the knowledge of the Company, and except as set forth on Schedule
3.13(l), there have been no material breaches, security incidents, or
unauthorized access to or disclosure of any Personal Information in the
possession or control of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not provided or, to the knowledge of the Company, been
required to provide any notices to any Person in connection with any such
unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information. Neither the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any third party acting at the direction or authorization
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has paid any ransom to (i) any
perpetrator of any data breach incident or cyber-attack suffered by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any third party with actual or
alleged information about a data breach incident or cyber-attack suffered by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to a request for payment from
or on behalf of such perpetrator or other third party.

3.14 Employees.

(a) The Company has made available to Buyer a true, correct and complete list
of all Persons who are employees, independent contractors or individual
consultants of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, including any
employee who is on a leave of absence of any nature, paid or unpaid, and sets
forth for each such individual the following: (i) name, (ii) title or position

with all applicable Laws governing labor, employment and employment practices,

Laws concerning COVID-19-related health and safety issues), employee whistle-
blowing, immigration, workers\' compensation, employee leave issues (including
the federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act, the federal Emergency Family and

Act), employee privacy, employment practices and classification of employees,
consultants and independent contractors.

(c) There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint pending or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board or any similar foreign,
state or local government agency. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any union organizing or
decertification activities in the past three (3) years, and, to the knowledge
of the



Company, no such activities are underway or threatened. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any strikes, work stoppage,
slowdowns or other labor disputes pending against or affecting the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the past three (3) years, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no such disputes are underway or threatened.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
Liability, the Company and its Subsidiaries have fully and timely paid all
wages, salaries, wage premiums, commissions, bonuses, severance and
termination payments, fees, and other compensation that have come due and
payable to any service providers under applicable Laws, contract or Company
policy. Schedule 3.14(d) sets forth the amount of any Taxes that otherwise
would have been required to be remitted or paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with amounts paid by the Company or any such
Subsidiary to any employee or individual service provider but have been

(e) To the Company\'s knowledge, no Person is in any respect in violation of
any term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law
nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty, noncompetition agreement,
restrictive covenant or other obligation: (i) with or to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (ii) with respect to any service provider, to any third
party with respect to such Person\'s right to be employed or engaged by the
Company or to the knowledge or use of trade secrets or proprietary
information.

(f) In the past three (3) years, neither the Company nor any of its

with any and all government orders restricting activity, such as "stay-at-
home" orders or business closure orders, or other similar directives issued by
federal, state, or local executive authorities applicable to any location in
which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate. To the extent the Company or
its Subsidiaries are or have been requiring employees to perform in-person
work in any locations subject to such an order or directive, the Company
represents that such continued operations and demands upon employees are in
compliance in all material respects with such orders, for example, because
such operations are "essential" or otherwise excluded from the applicability
of the orders restricting activity.

(h) To the extent the Company is aware of any employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that have tested positive for COVID-19, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken all precautions required under applicable Law with

commercially reasonable efforts to document any such diagnosis to the extent
required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

3.15 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule 3.15(a) sets forth a complete and correct list of each material
Plan. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Plan" means an "employee benefit

contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of
any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or

Body or required to be contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law.

(b) With respect to each Plan, copies of the following have been made

(c) Each Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan"
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the Company\'s knowledge, nothing
has occurred subsequent to the issuance of the most recent determination
letter that would reasonably be expected to cause such Plan to lose its
qualified status. The Plans are in material compliance with, and have for the
past three (3) years been established, maintained, funded, operated and
administered in all material respects with, their terms and applicable Laws,
including the requirements of the Code and ERISA.

(d) With respect to the Plans, (i) all contributions required to have been
made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been made in all material
respects, (ii) there are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than
routine claims for benefits, including any audit or investigation by any
Governmental Body, and (iii) there have been no acts or omissions by the
Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge,
any ERISA Affiliate that have given or would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any material fines, penalties, taxes or related charges under Sections
502 or 4071 of ERISA or Section 511 or Chapter 43 of the Code for which the
Company or the Company\'s Subsidiaries would expect to be materially liable,
including on account of any ERISA Affiliate.



(e) To the Company\'s knowledge, there have been no non-exempt "prohibited
transactions" (as that term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code).

(f) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, maintains,
contributes to, or has any obligation to contribute to, or has any current or

4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) multiple employer plan as described in Section
413(c) of the Code or (iv) "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined
in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(g) None of the Plans obligates the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide a
current or former employee (or any dependent thereof) with retiree health,
retiree welfare or retiree life insurance benefits or health coverage after
his or her termination of employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state or local Law.

during the past three (3) years complied in all material respects with, the
applicable provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the
"Affordable Care Act"), and no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company
to any material liability, penalties, or Taxes under Sections 4980D or 4980H
of the Code or any other provision of the Affordable Care Act.

(i) Each Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (if any) is in compliance in
all material respects therewith, such that no Taxes or interest will be due
and owing in respect of such Plan failing to be in compliance therewith. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have no obligation to "gross-up" or otherwise
indemnify any individual for any Tax, including under Sections 409A and 4999
of the Code.

(j) The exercise price of all Options that do not otherwise comply with
Section 409A of the Code is at least equal to the fair market value
(determined in a manner that is consistent with Section 409A of the Code) of
the Common Stock on the date such Options were granted, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or will incur any liability
to withhold taxes as a result of Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting of
any Options. All Options constitute options to purchase "service recipient
stock" (as defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)) with respect
to the grantor thereof.

(k) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(k) or as required by applicable Law,
neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the Transactions will (whether
alone or in combination with any other event) (excluding any agreement
contract, arrangement or plan entered into by, or at the direction of, Buyer
or its Affiliates): (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due in any
amount of compensation or benefits otherwise payable, to any current or former
employee, contractor or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or under
any Plan or (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting of any
benefits to any current or former employee, contractor or director of the



Company or its Subsidiaries or under any Plan, or increase any amount of
compensation or benefits otherwise payable, to any current or former employee,
contractor or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or under any Plan.
Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company or the Transactions shall (whether alone or in combination with any
other event) give rise to any "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code, any excise tax owing under Section 4999 of the Code or
any other amount that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(l) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15(l), as of the date hereof, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any steps towards

the same with respect to any action or inaction, (c) none of the Company or

Proceedings pending or, to Buyer\'s or Merger Sub\'s knowledge, threatened

Surviving Corporation for its own account with the present intention of
holding the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for investment purposes

Regulation D promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"). Each of Buyer and Merger Sub is knowledgeable about
the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate and is

all of the out-of-pocket costs of Buyer and Merger Sub arising in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions, and there is no restriction on the
use of such cash for such purposes. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree

Buyer\'s, Merger Sub\'s, their Affiliates\' or any other Person\'s ability to
obtain any financing for the consummation of the Transactions.

4.08 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.02, immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, Buyer and
each of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), will be able
to pay their respective debts as they become due and will own property that
has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their
respective



debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities). Assuming satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.02, and the solvency of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole, will
have adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation).

4.09 Operation of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged
in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or
obligations other than in connection with its organization and formation, its
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and its performance of their obligations hereunder and thereunder or in
furtherance of the Transactions. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Buyer.
Except for Transaction Documents or as expressly authorized by written consent
of the Company, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub, or any of their respective
Affiliates, is a party to any contract or agreement, or has made or entered
into any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings (whether or
not binding), with any stockholder, director, officer or other Affiliate of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or entered into in
connection with, the Transactions.

4.10 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company
acknowledges that neither Buyer, Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of
Buyer or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation or warranty

Subsidiaries, any sale of the Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, any sale of all or a material portion of the
assets or equity interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any similar

Agreement pursuant to Article VIII), the Company will, and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, partners,
officers, managers, employees, agents, Affiliates and Advisors to, promptly
(and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof) notify Buyer in
writing (including by electronic mail) of any proposal, offer, inquiry or
notice concerning an Acquisition Transaction or that would reasonably be

promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
using reasonable best efforts to (x) cause its conditions to Closing to be
satisfied and for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and (y) not

concessions (x) solely involve monetary payments included as Transaction

paid before the Closing, or (y) are otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer.

5.06 280G Cooperation. The Company will, no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to
obtain the shareholder approval in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto such that payments
or benefits to be received or retained by any "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) arising in whole or in part
as a result of or in connection with the Transactions should not be
characterized as "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code.
No later than one (1) Business Day prior to seeking such shareholder approval,
the Company will request waivers from such "disqualified individuals," which
waivers shall provide that unless such payments or benefits are approved by
the shareholders of the Company to the extent and manner prescribed under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, such payments or benefits shall not be made; provided that in no event
will this Section 5.06 be construed to require the Company to compel any
Person to waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that such
Person has with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and in no event will the
Company be deemed in breach of this Section 5.06 if any such Person refuses to
waive any such rights provided that the Company otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Section 5.06. The parties acknowledge that this Section
5.06 shall not apply to any arrangements entered into at the direction of
Buyer or its Affiliates or between Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and a disqualified individual on the other hand (the "Buyer
Arrangements") unless the Buyer provides to the Company, no less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a written description of any Buyer
Arrangements, and in such case, the Company shall include such description in
any materials disclosed to holders of Common Stock in connection with
soliciting approval in accordance with this Section 5.06; provided, however,
that for purposes of compliance with this Section 5.06, the Company may rely
solely on the information (if any) provided by Buyer with respect to the Buyer
Arrangements and that any failure to comply with this Section 5.06 as a result
of any lack of, or misinformation relating to, the Buyer Arrangements shall
not be deemed as a failure to comply with this Section 5.06. No later than
five (5) Business Days prior to soliciting the waivers described above, the
Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and related disclosure and
approval materials and applicable analyses and calculations performed in
connection therewith to Buyer for its reasonable review, comment and approval
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

set forth on Schedule 5.07, and, on the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer an executed copy of such payoff letter. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
take actions necessary to facilitate the termination of commitments under the
Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 5.07, subject to the occurrence of the



Closing, the repayment in full of all Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 5.07
then outstanding thereunder and the release of any Liens and termination of
all guarantees supporting such Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 5.07

that pertain to the consummation of the Transactions; and (d) any breach or

and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the remedies

hereto that (a) the individual set forth on Schedule 5.11 may not enter into
such restrictive covenant agreement with Buyer (notwithstanding the Company\'s
commercially reasonable efforts to encourage the same) and (b) compliance with
this Section 5.11 shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the

its provision.

ARTICLE VI 

COVENANTS OF BUYER AND MERGER SUB

6.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing until the seventh
anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide the Representative (and its Advisors reasonably
requiring such access in light of the purposes therefor) with reasonable
access, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to
the books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to
the Closing Date and reasonable access, during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable advance notice, to employees, officers, advisors, accountants,
offices and properties (including for the purpose of better understanding the
books and records) of the Company and its Subsidiaries so long as such access
and provision (i) do not, in the Surviving Corporation\'s good faith judgment,
unreasonably disrupt its business and organization



and (ii) are reasonably necessary in the Representative\'s pursuit of a bona
fide business pursuit. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Representative, neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation will, or will
permit the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7)
years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any
of the material books and records of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without first offering
to surrender to the Representative such books and records or any portion
thereof (at the Representative\'s cost and expense) that Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter
or dispose of. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such access shall be
permitted to the extent it would (A) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
or other legal immunity or protection from disclosure of the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or (B) contravene any Law,
contract or other obligation of confidentiality.

6.02 Regulatory Filings. Subject to Section 9.03, Buyer and Merger Sub will,
and will cause their respective Affiliates and Advisors to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) make or cause to be made all filings with and
submissions to any Governmental Body required under any applicable Laws for
the consummation of the Transactions, (b) coordinate and cooperate with the
Company in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
Company may reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing, and
(c) (i) supply promptly any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any further
filings with any Governmental Body pursuant thereto that may be necessary,
proper or advisable in connection therewith and (iii) take all actions
necessary to obtain all required clearances. The parties agree that this
Section 6.02 (and not Section 6.04) sets forth Buyer\'s and Merger Sub\'s sole
obligations with respect to regulatory filings, other than filings under the
HSR Act, which is governed solely by Section 9.03.

6.03 Notification. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub will promptly notify the
Company of: (a) any written notice or other written communication from any
Person to Buyer or Merger Sub alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions; (b) any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Body to Buyer or Merger Sub
related to or in connection with the Transactions; (c) any Legal Proceedings
commenced or, to its knowledge threatened in writing, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, relating to or involving Buyer, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates that pertain to the consummation of the
Transactions; and (d) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement at any time during
the term hereof that would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.03(a) not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.03 will not limit any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement or the remedies available hereunder to the Company.

6.04 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this Section 6.04 and in Section
9.03), Buyer and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates
and Advisors to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the
Merger and the other Transactions, including using reasonable best



efforts to (x) assist the Company in making any required notices and obtaining
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
third parties as may be necessary, (y) cause its conditions to Closing to be
satisfied and for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and (z) not
take any action intended to, or that would reasonably be expected to, prevent
the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, from the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries
shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation by Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries of the Transactions.

6.05 Contact with Business Relations. Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that
they are not authorized to, and Buyer agrees that it will not, and will cause
each member of the Buyer Group not to, contact any officer, director,
Stockholder, Optionholder or employee of, or any customer, supplier,
distributor, lessee, lessor, lender or other Person, in each case known to
have a material business relationship with, the Company or its Subsidiaries
before the Closing with respect to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Transactions, in each case, without receiving the prior
written consent of the Company before each such contact, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) within four (4) Business Days of the
anticipated Closing Date, the senior management of Buyer may contact or
otherwise address such employees of the Company in connection with transition
planning and related matters, in each case, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and after consulting in good faith with the senior management
of the Company as to the content of such communications and (b) Buyer or its
representatives may discuss obtaining a restrictive covenant agreement with
the individual identified in Schedule 5.11.

6.06 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due
thereafter, all sales, use, excise, goods and services, stock, conveyance,
gross receipts, registration, business and occupation, securities
transactions, real estate, land transfer, stamp, documentary, notarial,
filing, recording, permit, license, authorization or similar Taxes and all
applicable conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions,
whether imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries or imposed on any holder of
Common Stock or Options resulting from the Transactions (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") will be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Representative (on
behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation will prepare any Tax
Returns with respect to such Taxes, and Buyer and the Representative will
cooperate with the Surviving Corporation in the preparation and filing of such
Tax Returns.

(b) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any
Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims. Such cooperation will
include providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant
to this Section 6.06(b).



(c) Tax Sharing Agreements. Effective as of the Closing Date, any and all tax
sharing or allocation agreements or arrangements to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to shall be terminated such that none of Buyer,
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any counterparty thereto shall have
any further liability thereunder.

(d) Filing of Tax Returns. The Representative shall, at the Stockholders\'
sole cost and expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date for Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other
than any Straddle Periods). All such income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Representative shall furnish a completed copy of each such
income Tax Return to Buyer for Buyer\'s review and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than thirty (30)
Business Days before the due date for filing such Tax Return.

(e) Straddle Period Tax Allocation. The Company shall, unless prohibited by
applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not
permit the Company to close the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and in any case
in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a Straddle Period, the amount of
such Taxes, if any, shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date. Any allocation of Taxes
(other than property and ad valorem Taxes) attributable to a Straddle Period
shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as
of the end of the Closing Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on
the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the
number of days in each such period. With respect to any property or ad valorem
Tax, such Tax shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in
each such period.

6.07 No Modification of RWI Policy. To the extent Buyer binds the RWI Policy,
such RWI Policy will not entitle the provider thereunder to pursue any
recourse against any Person that is not a party to the RWI Policy, except by
exercising subrogation rights thereunder in the case of actual and intentional
fraud in respect of the representations and warranties made by a party to this
Agreement, and Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates to not, amend,
modify or otherwise change, terminate or waive any provision of the RWI Policy
from the version so bound (a) with respect to the waiver of subrogation set
forth therein, or (ii) in any manner that would be reasonably likely to
increase or expand the ability or rights of the provider thereunder to bring a
Legal Proceeding against, or otherwise seek recourse from, any of the Seller
Parties, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing as follows and in no other manner:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand;

(b) by Buyer, on the one hand, or by the Company, on the other hand, if the
Closing has not occurred on or before August 31, 2020 (as the same may be
extended pursuant to this Section 8.01(b), the "End Date"); provided however
that if on the initial End Date the condition set forth in Section 7.01(a) or
Section 7.01(b) is not satisfied but all other conditions to Closing in
Article VII are satisfied or have been waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature only can be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing,
but subject to those conditions being capable of being satisfied at such
time), then either Buyer or the Company may, in its sole discretion, extend
the End Date by forty-five (45) days on up to two (2) occasions only by
providing written notice of such extension to the other party, in which case
the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such later date (provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the End Date shall in no event be extended
to a date later than ninety (90) days after August 31, 2020); provided that
(i) no termination may be made under this Section 8.01(b) if the failure to
consummate the Closing by the End Date was caused by the breach of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) and (ii)
if the satisfaction, or waiver by the appropriate party, of all of the
conditions contained in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature only can be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to
such conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing) occurs two
(2) Business Days or less before the End Date, then neither Buyer nor the
Company will be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(b) until the third (3rd) Business Day after the End Date; provided,
further, that Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.01(b) during the pendency of a legal proceeding by the
Company or the Representative for specific performance pursuant to Section
10.16;

(c) by Buyer, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of
the Company has become untrue, in each case, such that the conditions set
forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) would not be satisfied; provided,
however, that, (i) Buyer notifies the Company of such breach, and if such
breach is curable by the Company, then Buyer may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.01(c) unless such breach has not been cured by the date
which is the earlier of (A) two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date and
(B) fifteen (15) Business Days after the Company\'s receipt of Buyer\'s
notification of such breach (it being understood that no cure period shall
apply in the event the applicable breach is not capable of being cured) and
(ii) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c)
will not be available to Buyer at any time that Buyer or Merger Sub is then in
breach of any covenant, agreement or representation and warranty hereunder, in
each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section
7.03(b) would not be satisfied;



(d) by the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of
Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub has become untrue, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) would not be
satisfied; provided, however, that, (i) the Company notifies the Buyer of such
breach, and if such breach is curable by Buyer or Merger Sub, then the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) unless such breach
has not been cured by the date which is the earlier of (A) two (2) Business
Days prior to the End Date and (B) fifteen (15) Business Days after Buyer\'s
receipt of the Company\'s notification of such breach (it being understood
that no cure period shall apply in the event the applicable breach is not
capable of being cured) and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) will not be available to the Company at any
time that the Company is then in breach of any covenant, agreement or
representation and warranty hereunder, in each case, such that the conditions
set forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) would not be satisfied;

(e) by Buyer, by written notice to the Company, after 11:59 p.m. central time
on May 14, 2020, unless prior to such termination, the Company has delivered
to Buyer a written consent constituting the Necessary Stockholder Approval;
and

(f) by either Buyer or the Company, if (i) there is a final non-appealable
Order in effect prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or (ii) there is
any Law enacted, promulgated or issued that is applicable to the Merger or the
other Transactions by any Governmental Body that would make consummation of
the Merger or any of the other Transactions, up to and including the End Date,
illegal; provided, that no termination may be made under this Section 8.01(f)
by any party whose breach of this Agreement primarily results in or is the
cause of such Order.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01
shall give written notice of such termination to the other parties. Any
termination by the Company under this Section 8.01 (whether before or after
the Necessary Stockholder Approval has been delivered to Buyer) will be by
action of its board of directors (without requiring any action by the
Stockholders).

8.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01, this Agreement will become void and have no further legal effect
without any liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto, (i) other
than liabilities and obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii)
except that the provisions of this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article X
will survive any termination of this Agreement and (iii) except that no such
termination will relieve any party from any liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations, costs or expenses (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall
not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs, and may
include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company,
the Stockholders and/or the Optionholders) relating to such party\'s willful
breach of this Agreement.

8.03 Certain Other Effects of Termination. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement by either the Company or Buyer as provided in Section 8.01, the
Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect and survive the
termination of this Agreement for a period of eighteen (18) months following
the date of such termination.



ARTICLE IX 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

9.01 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any party
hereto and at such party\'s expense, any other party will execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such
requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and
effectuate the Transactions.

9.02 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a) Compensation and Benefits. Effective as of the Closing and continuing for
one (1) year thereafter, Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide to all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) as
of immediately following the Closing (the "Retained Employees") with employee
benefits, plans, programs, and arrangements (excluding severance, paid time
off for exempt employees, change in control, defined benefit, retention
bonuses, cash incentive compensation and equity compensation) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to the Retained
Employees immediately before the Closing (excluding severance, paid time off
for exempt employees, change in control, defined benefit, retention bonuses,
cash incentive compensation and equity compensation). Without limiting the
foregoing, for a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing for a one
(1) year period thereafter, Buyer will or will cause its Affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to provide to each Retained Employee
who remains in the employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) a base salary or base wage
rate that is no less favorable than that provided to each Retained Employee
immediately before the Closing. Nothing in this Section 9.02 will obligate
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to continue (and
will not prevent Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
from modifying or terminating) the employment of any such Retained Employee or
create a right in any Retained Employee to employment with Buyer, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

(b) Employee Service Credit. Buyer shall (i) give, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to give, each Retained Employee credit under any employee benefit
plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including sick leave) (the
"Buyer Plans"), for purposes of eligibility and vesting of benefits and
entitlement to sick leave for the Retained Employee\'s service with the
Company and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar Plan, except in each case (A) with
respect to benefit accrual under qualified and nonqualified defined benefit
pension plans, (B) to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative
benefits or (C) to the extent prior service is not credited to employees of
Buyer under Buyer Plans, and (ii) (A) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or
limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (B) give each Retained Employee
credit under the medical, prescription, dental and vision plans of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries in which



they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable deductibles, co-pays and
other annual out-of-pocket limits.

(c) 401(k) Plan. The Company shall adopt written resolutions to terminate,
effective immediately before the Closing, any Plan sponsored by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that is intended to qualify as a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (a
"Company 401(k) Plan"), and effective immediately prior to the Closing, (i)
all participants in any Company 401(k) Plan shall be fully vested in their
account balances and (ii) no Retained Employee or other Person shall have any
right thereafter to contribute any amounts to such Company 401(k) Plan based
upon compensation earned after the Closing. The Company will provide Buyer
with a copy of such proposed resolutions terminating such Company 401(k) Plan
prior to adoption thereof by the board of directors of the Company and shall
deliver evidence to Buyer that the board of directors of the Company approved
such resolutions. Buyer shall establish or designate a replacement plan
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Buyer 401(k) Plan") for which
Retained Employees who participated in a Company 401(k) Plan shall become
eligible to participate immediately after the Closing Date. Buyer shall take
all steps necessary to cause such Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from a
Company 401(k) Plan, including a rollover of any associated plan loans, as
directed by the Retained Employees.

(d) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions contained in this Section
9.02 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing set
forth in this Section 9.02 will (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any
employee or former employee of the Company, any Retained Employee or upon any
other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Plan or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this Section 9.02, alter or limit
Buyer\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' ability
to amend, modify or terminate any specific benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time.

9.03 Antitrust Notification.

(a) The Company and the Buyer Parties will, as promptly as practicable and no
later than five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), any notification form required pursuant
to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which form will specifically request
early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. Each of the
Company and the Buyer Parties will furnish to each other\'s counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and will provide any supplemental information requested by
any Governmental Body as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable. The
Company and the Buyer Parties will each use their reasonable best efforts to
comply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable with any requests
made for any additional information in connection with



such filings. Buyer will be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all filing
fees payable in connection with such filings, and the other fifty percent
(50%) shall constitute Transaction Expenses.

(b) The Company and the Buyer Parties each will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly obtain any HSR Approval for the consummation of the
Transactions and will keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Body and will comply as promptly as reasonably
practicable with any such inquiry or request. The Company and the Buyer
Parties will take, and will cause their Affiliates to take, any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the Transactions, including (i) entering
into a consent decree, consent agreement or other agreement or arrangement
containing Buyer\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s agreement to hold
separate, license, sell and/or divest (pursuant to such terms as may be
required by any Governmental Body) such assets or businesses of Buyer and its
Affiliates after the Closing (including entering into customary ancillary
agreements relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of
such assets or businesses), and (ii) agreeing to any such limitations on
conduct or actions of members of Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing as
may be required in order to obtain satisfaction of the closing conditions set
forth in Section 7.01(a) before the End Date; provided, however, that nothing
in this Agreement, including this Section 9.03 or the "reasonable best
efforts" or other similar standard generally, shall require, or be construed
to require, the Buyer Parties to proffer to, or agree to, or to permit the
Company to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, or otherwise encumber
before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein of Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything else herein, nothing in this agreement, including this Section 9.03,
shall be construed to require the Buyer Parties to undertake any efforts or
take any action if the taking of such efforts or action, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a detrimental and
material impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole.

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsel\'s undertaking, subject to applicable Law, (i) to
keep each other appropriately informed of material communications from and to
personnel of the reviewing Governmental Bodies and (ii) to confer with each
other regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such
Governmental Bodies and the content of any such contacts or presentations.
Neither the Company nor the Buyer Parties will participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion with any Governmental Body with respect to any such
filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other
party prior notice of such meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted
by the relevant Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of either Buyer or the
Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only); provided that,
the Company or the Buyer Parties, as applicable, may participate in any such
meeting or discussion described in the foregoing clause in the absence of such
other party if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Company or the Buyer



Parties, as applicable, have made every effort in good faith to involve the
other party in such meeting or discussion, (B) such other party was provided
with reasonable and adequate notice of such meeting or discussion and (C)
despite such efforts and reasonable and adequate notice, the involvement of
such other party in any such meeting or discussion has become impracticable in
the good faith opinion of the party seeking to hold such meeting or
discussion. The Company will have the right to review (subject to appropriate
redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client privilege concerns) and
approve the content of any presentations, white papers or other written
materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of any such
submission. Consistent with its obligations hereunder (including its
obligation to enable the parties hereto to expeditiously consummate the
Transactions), Buyer shall lead all communications and strategy for dealing
with the FTC and the DOJ in connection with any review pursuant to the HSR
Act; provided, however, that Buyer shall act reasonably and consult in advance
with the Company (and its outside antitrust counsel) regarding such matters
and shall consider in good faith, and in Buyer\'s reasonable discretion
incorporate, the Company\'s reasonable views and feedback. It is further
understood and agreed that Buyer may withdraw and refile its filing under the
HSR Act if, in its good faith judgment, it determines (after consultation with
the Company and taking the Company\'s views into account), that the taking of
such action would be consistent with, and would not undermine, the parties\'
efforts to expeditiously consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the written consent of the Company shall be required prior to Buyer
entering into any agreement with any Governmental Body pursuant to which Buyer
has agreed not to consummate the Transactions for any period of time.

9.04 Certain Consents. Upon Buyer\'s written request, the Company will, or
will cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
any required notice and seek all necessary consents and approvals from third
parties as are required to be obtained from or made to parties to contracts or
other agreements to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are a party. Buyer
and Merger Sub knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and expressly acknowledge
and agree that certain notices, consents or approvals with respect to the
Transactions may be required from Governmental Bodies or parties to contracts
or other agreements to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party
(including the agreements set forth on Schedule 3.11) and that such notices,
consents and approvals have not been delivered or obtained, as applicable, as
of the date of this Agreement and may not be delivered or obtained. Buyer and
Merger Sub knowingly, willingly, irrevocably, and expressly acknowledge and
agree that, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, subject to the
accuracy of and the Company\'s compliance with each of, as applicable, Section
3.02(c), Section 9.03, this Section 9.04, Section 9.05(a), and its other
covenants and agreements to cooperate with Buyer and seek any other reasonable
and appropriate consents or other approvals provided herein, neither the
Company nor any of the Seller Parties will have any liability whatsoever to
Buyer or Merger Sub, and Buyer and Merger Sub will not be entitled to assert
any claims against any Seller Party, in each case, arising out of or relating
to the failure to deliver or obtain any notices, consents or approvals that
may have been or may be required in connection with the Transactions (other
than pursuant to the HSR Act and the Necessary Stockholder Approval) or
because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of any right
under any such contract or other agreement solely and directly as a result of
the Closing and the failure to deliver or obtain any such notice, consent or
approval, unless (and only to the extent that) the Company shall have breached
its applicable



obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
9.04 is intended to abrogate, limit or in any way impair Buyer\'s or Merger
Sub\'s rights under Article VII.

9.05 Written Consents; Section 262 Notices.

(a) Promptly (and in any event by 11:59 p.m. central time on May 14, 2020)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer a copy of an irrevocable written consent of Stockholders
constituting the Necessary Stockholder Approval, evidencing the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions.

(b) The Company will, in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational
documents, on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement, mail to any Stockholder that has not theretofore executed a
written consent adopting this Agreement, approving the Transactions and
waiving any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a "Remaining
Stockholder") a request that such Stockholder execute the written consent of
the Company\'s Stockholders approving the Merger as provided in Section 228 of
the DGCL and that such Stockholder waive any appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL. In connection with such request, the Company will, through
its board of directors, recommend to its Stockholders approval of the Merger.
Approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders of the Company will not
restrict the ability of the Company\'s board of directors thereafter to
terminate or amend this Agreement to the extent permitted by this Agreement
and not prohibited under Section 251(d) of the DGCL. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to
Buyer, for review and comment, the information statement or other information
to be delivered to the Remaining Stockholders, and will incorporate therein
any reasonable comments of Buyer and its legal counsel delivered to the
Company within five (5) Business Days after receiving such information
statement or other information. Such information statement or other
information will be mailed by the Company to the Remaining Stockholders not
later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement.

9.06 Affiliate Contracts. The Company will cause the termination, effective no
later than the Effective Time, of the contracts or arrangements set forth on
Schedule 9.06 without any further cost or Liability to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or, after the Effective Time, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates).

9.07 Exercise of Drag-Along. The Representative shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, exercise its drag-along right pursuant to Section
4.2 of the Stockholders Agreement.

ARTICLE X 

MISCELLANEOUS

10.01 Survival; Certain Waivers.

(a) Each of the representations and warranties and the covenants and
agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires
performance by such party prior to the Closing) of the parties set forth in
this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby,



or in any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder, will terminate
effective immediately as of the Closing. Each covenant and agreement requiring
performance at or after the Closing, will, in each case, expressly survive
Closing in accordance with its terms, and if no term is specified, then for
the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law, and nothing in this
Section 10.01(a) will be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of any Person
for breach of any such surviving covenant or agreement (with it being
understood that Buyer and Merger Sub will also be liable for breach of any
covenant or agreement requiring performance by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, and that nothing herein will limit
or affect Buyer\'s or Merger Sub\'s or any of their respective Affiliates\'
liability for the failure to pay the Merger Consideration (in whole or in
part) or pay any other amounts payable by them (in whole or in part) as and
when required by this Agreement).

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the Company and the Buyer Parties knowingly, willingly,
irrevocably and expressly waive, on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group, any and all rights, claims and causes of action any of them may
have against any Seller Party (excluding any Person who continues to be an
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time, but only in such Person\'s capacity as such) relating to the
operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby, or the Transactions, in each case, whether or not arising
under, or based upon, any Law (including any right, whether arising at law or
in equity to seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or
any other recourse or remedy (other than, and solely with respect to any of
the covenants that survive the Closing in accordance with Section 10.01(a))).
Furthermore, from and after the Effective Time, without limiting the
generality of this Section 10.01, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, no Legal Proceeding will be brought, encouraged, supported or
maintained by, or on behalf of, any member of the Buyer Group (including,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or
the Seller Group against any of the Seller Parties or Buyer Parties (excluding
any Person who continues to be an officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, but only in such Person\'s capacity
as such), as the case may be, and no recourse will be sought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or any other Person set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby
or any certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or other document of the
Company or any other Person delivered hereunder or in connection with the
Transactions (other than, and solely with respect to, any of the covenants
that survive the Closing in accordance with Section 10.01(a)), the subject
matter of this Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, the business, the ownership, operation, management, use or
control of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of
their assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing or the
Effective Time.

10.02 Acknowledgement by the Buyer Parties.

(a) The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf
of the Buyer Group, that they have conducted, to their satisfaction, an
independent investigation



and verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, in making their determination to proceed with the
Transactions, the Buyer Parties have relied on the results of their own
independent investigation and verification and have not relied on, are not
relying on, and will not rely on, any of the Company, its Subsidiaries, any
Stockholder or Optionholder of the Company, the Data Room, the Projections or
any other information, statements, disclosures, or materials, in each case
whether written or oral, provided by, or as part of, any of the foregoing or
any other Seller Party, or any failure of any of the foregoing to disclose or
contain any information, except for the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article III, in each case, as
qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. Such representations and warranties by
the Company constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties
of the Company to the Buyer Parties in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the
investigation by the Buyer Parties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Buyer Parties and their Affiliates, and the representatives of each of the
foregoing, have received or may receive, from or on behalf of the Company,
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts
(collectively, "Projections"). The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on
their own behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that (i) such Projections
are being provided solely for the convenience of the Buyer Parties to
facilitate their own independent investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
Projections, (iii) the Buyer Parties are familiar with such uncertainties, and
(iv) the Buyer Parties are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Projections (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such Projections).

(c) The Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties knowingly, willingly, irrevocably
and expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group or the Seller Group, as the case may be, that the agreements
contained in Section 10.01 and this Section 10.02 (i) require performance
after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will
survive the Closing for the maximum duration permitted under applicable Law
and will not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions
of Section 10.01; and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without the agreements set forth in Section 10.01 or this Section 10.02
neither party would enter into this Agreement and the Company would not
recommend approval of this Agreement to the Stockholders.

10.03 Provision Respecting Representation of Company. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, managers, members, officers, employees and
Affiliates, (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has been retained by, and may serve
as counsel to, each and any of the Representative, Stockholders and
Optionholders and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one
hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions, (b) that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the
Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a
client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP for conflict



of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof, and (c) that, following
consummation of the Transactions, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any of its
respective successors) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, manager, officer, employee or Affiliate of any
member of the Seller Group, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the parties hereto (on their own
behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and
knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each of such parties will cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Buyer, the Company and the Seller Group
hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer, the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the
Seller Group or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Kirkland and
Ellis LLP may represent the Seller Group, and/or such Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of the Seller Group, and/or such Affiliates
may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even
though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
In addition, Buyer agrees that (x) all communications prior to the Effective
Time among any member of the Seller Group, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
Advisors, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP that relate to the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in
connection with, this Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale
of the Company or the Transactions (the "Protected Seller Communications"),
will be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications, (y) all
rights to such Protected Seller Communications, the expectation of client
confidentiality, and the control of the confidentiality and privilege
applicable thereto, belong to and will be retained by the Seller Group and (z)
to the extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing) should discover in its possession after the
Closing any communications that constitute Protected Seller Communications
(based on a plain reading by a reasonable person of such communications), it
will take commercially reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality
thereof. As to any such Protected Seller Communications prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of
their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further
agree that none of the foregoing may use or rely on any of the Protected
Seller Communications in any action against or involving any of the Seller
Group or Kirkland and Ellis LLP after the Closing. The Protected Seller
Communications may be used by the Seller Group and/or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates in any way to this
Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and a third party other than the Seller Group (solely in their
capacity as equityholders of the Company or the Representative), on the other
hand, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-
client privilege with respect to Protected Seller Communications to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party. The Buyer
Parties and the Seller Parties knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly
acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group
and the Seller Group, respectively, that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.03 (i) require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law and will survive the Closing for the maximum
duration permitted under applicable Law and will not be subject to any of the
survival



or exclusive remedy provisions of Section 10.01; and (ii) are an integral part
of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth in this Section
10.03, neither party would enter into this Agreement and the Company would not
recommend approval of this Agreement to the Stockholders.

10.04 Press Releases and Communications. The initial press release announcing
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions shall be
substantially in the form mutually agreed upon by Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Representative, on the other hand. No other press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the
Transactions will be issued or made by any party to this Agreement or any of
its Affiliates or representatives without the joint approval of Buyer and the
Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required by Law or the rules and regulations of any
applicable stock exchange, in which case Buyer or the Representative, as
applicable, will have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
press release or announcement in advance of such publication; provided that no
such consent shall be required in the event that Buyer, any Seller Party or
any of their respective Affiliates makes any such announcement or other
statement, in each case, to the extent such announcement or other statement is
consistent in all material respects with the initial press release; and
provided further that, following the Closing, each Seller Party will be
entitled to communicate regarding the Transactions with its and its
Affiliates\' investors in the ordinary course of business if such investors
are bound by an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
communications.

10.05 Expenses. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as otherwise
provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and
expenses of Advisors and appraisal fees, costs and expenses, and travel,
lodging, entertainment and associated expenses) incurred in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
will, subject to Section 10.19, be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
except that (i) Buyer will pay all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent and
the Escrow Agent at the Closing (however, fifty percent (50%) of such fees and
expenses will be deemed to be Transaction Expenses), (ii) the fees and
expenses of the Firm will be allocated pursuant to Section 1.07(c), as
applicable, (iii) the Company will pay all fees and expenses in connection
with the "tail" insurance policies set forth in Section 5.10, (iv) Buyer will
pay all fees and expenses in connection with any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act (however, fifty percent (50%) of the filing fee
associated with the HSR Act will be deemed to be Transaction Expenses), (v)
Buyer will pay all fees and expenses assessed by any insurer or otherwise
incurred in connection with obtaining any representation and warranty
insurance policy in connection with the Transactions (however, fifty percent
(50%) of such fees and expenses will be deemed to be Transaction Expenses;
provided, that in no event shall the amount included in Transaction Expenses
in respect of such fees and expenses exceed $300,000) and (vi) Buyer will pay
all Transfer Taxes (however, fifty percent (50%) of the Transfer Taxes will be
deemed to be Transaction Expenses).

10.06 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices,
demands and other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason
of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to
have been given (a) when personally delivered, (b) when transmitted via

next Business Day), (c) the day following the day on which the same has been
delivered prepaid to a reputable



national overnight air courier service or (d) the third (3rd) Business Day

10.07 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated without the prior written consent of (a) prior to the Closing, the
Company and Buyer and (b) from and after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Representative; provided, that Buyer and Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement to any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that
no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or Merger Sub of their respective
obligations under this Agreement; provided, further, that Buyer may assign its
rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to the provider of any
representation and warranty insurance policy only to the extent such
assignment is necessary to permit such provider to exercise its rights of
subrogation (which rights may not be amended without the prior written consent
of the Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) solely in the event of actual and intentional fraud in
respect of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

10.08 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended or
waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, the Representative
and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub; and (b) subject to Section 7.04,
with respect to the waiver of conditions to Closing as of the Effective Time,
any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective against Buyer,
the Company, the Representative or, prior to the Closing, Merger Sub, only as
set forth in a writing executed by such Person. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way
any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

10.09 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including Section 5.10, and except for Sections 10.01, 10.02, 10.03,
10.09 and 10.10 in respect of which each member of the Seller Group is a third
party beneficiary, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be
construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement



any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with this Agreement without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as

Schedules or the attached exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts,
or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or

respecting the sale and purchase of the Company.

10.15 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that, other than with respect to the Restrictive Covenant

this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term,
condition or provision of any other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated by this Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.

10.16 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties
hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 10.17 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 8.02 are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and
will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
party\'s right to specific performance or other equitable relief and (c) the
right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the



Company nor Buyer would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable
relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy of law.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party pursuing an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 10.16 will not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such Order.

cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal theory under which such
liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise under any legal
or equitable theory, that may be based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or
the Transactions brought by any other party or its successors or assigns will

jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such Legal
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions.

the State of Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds,
including the doctrine of forum non-conveniens. Each party hereby irrevocably
consents to the service of any and all process in any such Legal Proceeding by
delivery of such process in the manner provided in Section 10.06 and agrees

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 10.19, Thomas H. Lee

the Stockholders and Optionholders for certain limited purposes, as specified
herein. Approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders holding a majority of
the outstanding Common Stock will, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable Law (including DGCL § 251(b)), constitute knowing and irrevocable
ratification and approval of such designation by the Stockholders and the
Optionholders, and authorization of the Representative to serve in such
capacity (including the exclusive power to negotiate and settle any and all
disputes with Buyer or Merger Sub under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Paying Agent Agreement) and will also constitute a reaffirmation,
approval, consent to, acceptance and adoption of, and an agreement to comply
with and perform, all of the acknowledgments, waivers, releases, covenants and
agreements made by the Representative on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders in this Agreement and the other documents delivered in
connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent
Agreement), in each case, whether entered into or taken before, on or after
the date of such approval. The Representative may resign at any time and may
be removed only by the vote of Persons that collectively owned more than 50%
of the Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(x) shares of Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 1.04(c) and (y)
Dissenting Shares) (such Persons, the "Majority Holders"). The designation of
the Representative is coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the resignation or removal
of the Representative, such designation is irrevocable and will not be
affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other
inability to act of any of the Stockholders or Optionholders. In the event
that a Representative has resigned or been removed in accordance with this
Section 10.19(a), a new Representative will be appointed by the Majority
Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance
thereof by the new Representative. Written notice of any such resignation,
removal, or appointment of a Representative will be delivered by the
Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is taken.



(b) The Representative will have such powers and authority as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and
in any other document delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement); provided, however, that the
Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders or
Optionholders. The Company, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and the Firm will be entitled to rely on the
actions taken by the Representative without independent inquiry into the
capacity of the Representative to so act. All actions, notices, communications
and determinations by the Representative to carry out such functions will
conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and will be binding upon,
the Stockholders and Optionholders. Neither the Representative, nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, partners (general or limited), members,
managers, or Advisors will have any liability to Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders or Optionholders, or any
of their respective Affiliates, or any Person acting on behalf of the
foregoing, with respect to actions taken, or omitted to be taken, by the
Representative in such capacity (or its officers, directors, employees,
partners (general or limited), members, managers, or Advisors in connection
therewith), except the Representative will be liable for its willful
misconduct and actual fraud as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which no further appeal may be taken. The Representative
will be entitled to engage such Advisors as it will deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its functions hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Representative) will be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons in
all matters. The Representative (for itself, and for its officers, directors,
employees, partners (general or limited), members, managers, Advisors) will be
entitled to full reimbursement for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances (including fees and disbursements of its Advisors) incurred by or on
behalf of the Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers,
directors, employees, partners (general or limited), members, managers, or
Advisors in connection therewith), and to full indemnification against any
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Representative (except
for those arising out of the Representative\'s willful misconduct and actual
fraud as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no
further appeal may be taken), including the costs and expenses of
investigation, defense, settlement or adjudication of any Legal Proceeding,
from the Stockholders and the Optionholders (including from funds paid to the
Representative under this Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its
capacity as the Representative, or funds to be distributed to the Stockholders
or Optionholders under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement and
Paying Agent Agreement)) and all payments required to be made under Article I
are expressly subject to this Section 10.19(b). Each Stockholder and
Optionholder will be responsible for its pro rata portion of any amount owed
to the Representative in accordance with this Section 10.19(b) based upon the
pro rata portion of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares held by such
Stockholder or Optionholder immediately prior to the Closing. In furtherance
of the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Representative will have the power and authority to set aside and retain
additional funds paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional
funds to be paid to the Stockholders or Optionholders as Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement at Closing or thereafter (including to establish
such reserves as the Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate
for such costs and expenses that are not then known or determinable). The
relationship created herein is not to be construed as



a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Representative
or any Stockholder or Optionholder for any purpose of U.S. federal or state
Law, including federal, state or foreign income Tax purposes. Neither the
Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to
any Stockholder or Optionholder.

(c) Each Buyer Party (on its own behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group) and
the Company acknowledge that the Representative is a party to this Agreement
solely for the purpose of serving as the "Representative" hereunder, and no
Legal Proceeding will be brought by, or on behalf of, any Buyer Party or the
Buyer Group (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) against the Representative with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions, or any statement, certificate, instruction,
opinion, instrument or other documents delivered hereunder (with it being
understood that any covenant or agreement of or by the "parties" or "each of
the parties" will not be deemed to require performance by, or be an agreement
of, the Representative unless performance by the Representative is expressly
provided for in such covenant or the Representative expressly so agrees in
writing).

10.20 Counterparts. This Agreement, and any other agreements referred to
herein or therein, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in
multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more
than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one
and the same instrument. Any counterpart, to the extent signed and delivered
by means of a facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission, will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such contract, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such contract will raise the use of a facsimile machine, .pdf or
other electronic transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

11.03 Interpretation. In addition to the definitions referred to or set forth
in this Agreement:

(a) Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement have
the meanings given to them under GAAP. To the extent that the definition of an
accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with the meaning of
such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement will control.

(b) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and terms of similar import
are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references
contained in this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and
exhibits in or to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Where the context permits, the use of the term "or" will be
equivalent to the use of the term "and/or."

(d) Words denoting any gender will include all genders, including the neutral
gender. Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular will
include references to the plural and vice versa.

(e) All references to "$" and dollars will be deemed to refer to United States
currency unless otherwise specifically provided.

(f) All references to a day or days will be deemed to refer to a calendar day
or calendar days, as applicable, unless otherwise specifically provided.

(g) Any document or item will be deemed "delivered", "provided" or "made
available" by the Company or the Representative, as applicable, within the
meaning of this Agreement if such document or item (i) is included in the
electronic dataroom hosted by RR Donnelley (the "Data Room") but only to the
extent such information or documents were accessible to Buyer or its
Affiliates and Advisors continuously for at least forty-eight hours prior to
the execution of this Agreement or (ii) actually delivered or provided to
Buyer or any of Buyer\'s Advisors, including at the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' offices, prior to the date of this Agreement.

(h) Any reference to any particular Code section or any Law will be
interpreted to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless
of how it is numbered or classified, unless otherwise expressly provided
herein.

(i) Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

(j) Whenever this Agreement requires Buyer to take any action or contains a
representation with respect to Buyer, where applicable or necessary to give
effect to the Transactions, such requirement or representation shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of its



Subsidiaries formed in connection with the Transactions to take such action
and shall be deemed to include a reference to such Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Buyer to take
any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Buyer to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

(k) The phrase "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" and
similar phrases will mean, with respect to any Person, the ordinary course of
such Person\'s business consistent with past custom and practice (and giving
effect to any adjustments and modifications thereto prior to the date of this
