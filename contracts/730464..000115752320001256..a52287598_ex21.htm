"), (c) Transaction Expenses (" _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (d)

versions of the Estimated Closing Statement, which updated versions shall
thereupon supersede and replace the  prior versions for all purposes
hereunder.

 

SECTION 2.04. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Delivery of Closing Statement_.   As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date but no later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Seller a
written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), setting  forth in reasonable
detail its calculation of the amount of (i) Closing Working Capital, (ii)
Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, (iii) Transaction Expenses, (iv) Closing

calculation of the Purchase Price and the adjustment (if any) necessary to

which shall be determined in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement
and the Accounting  Principles and shall not reflect any accounting
principles, policies, methods, practices, categories, estimates, judgments or
assumptions other than the Accounting Principles.

 

(b) _Objections; Resolution of  Disputes_.

 

 

 

(i) Unless Seller notifies Purchaser in writing within  45 days after
Purchaser's delivery of the Closing Statement (such 45-day period, the "
_Objection Period_ ") of any dispute or objection thereto based on Seller's
good faith belief that the Closing Statement was not prepared in accordance
with  the requirements of Section 2.04(a) (a " _Notice of Objection_ "), the
Closing Statement and the calculations of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Transaction Expenses, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Tax Amount and the  Purchase Price set forth therein shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Parties. Following the delivery of the Closing Statement
and for purposes of Seller's review of the Closing Statement and preparation
of any Notice of Objection,  Seller and its Representatives, upon reasonable
advance notice, shall be permitted during normal business hours to review the
books and records of Purchaser and the Company Group and shall be provided
with all information and reasonable access to  the Representatives of
Purchaser and the Company Group, as applicable, who were involved in the
preparation of the Closing Statement, including, subject to Seller's and its
applicable Representatives' entry into a customary access letter required  by
such accountants, all work papers of the accountants who audited, compiled or
reviewed such statement in connection with Seller's and its Representatives'
review thereof. Any information provided to Seller and its Representatives
pursuant to  this Section 2.04(b)(i) shall be considered Confidential
Information and subject to Section 5.03. Any Notice of Objection shall specify
the amount in dispute for each disputed item and the basis for the objections
set forth therein. Seller  shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement not so disputed by
Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

(ii) If Seller provides the Notice of Objection to  Purchaser within the
Objection Period, Seller and Purchaser shall, during the 30‑day period
following Purchaser's receipt of the Notice of Objection (such 30-day period,
the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve Seller's 
objections. During the Resolution Period, Purchaser and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives shall be permitted to review the working
papers of Seller and, subject to Purchaser's and its applicable
Representatives' entry into a  customary access letter required by such
accountants, its accountants involved with preparing the Notice of Objection
and the basis therefor. All such discussions and communications between the
Parties related thereto shall (unless otherwise  agreed by Purchaser and
Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state rule, and any resolution by them agreed to in writing
as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.   The
resolution of any disputed item during the Resolution Period shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
resolve all such objections within the Resolution Period, then either Seller
or  Purchaser may refer all such matters remaining in dispute to a nationally
recognized independent valuation, accounting or specialty firm to be mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser or, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to
agree within  five Business Days from the end of the Resolution Period, then
such nationally recognized independent valuation, accounting or specialty firm
jointly selected by Seller's and Purchaser's independent accountants within
five Business Days  thereafter (such agreed firm being the " _Independent
Expert_ "). Seller and Purchaser each agree to promptly sign an engagement
letter among Seller, Purchaser and the Independent Expert, in commercially
reasonable form, as may reasonably be  required by the Independent Expert, on
terms and conditions consistent with this Section 2.04. The Independent Expert
shall be instructed, acting as an expert in accounting and not as an
arbitrator, pursuant to such engagement letter, to resolve  only those
matters set forth in the Notice of Objection remaining in dispute. Seller and
Purchaser each agree to furnish to the Independent Expert access to such
individuals and such information, books and records as may be reasonably
required  by the Independent Expert to make its final determination (any such
information, books and records shall be provided to the other Party prior to
its submission or presentation to the Independent Expert). As promptly as
practicable, and in any  event not more than 30 days following the engagement
of the Independent Expert, or such later date as Seller and Purchaser may
mutually agree, Purchaser and Seller shall each submit a written presentation
detailing each Party's complete statement  of proposed resolution of each
issue still in dispute to the Independent Expert (it being understood that the
content of each such presentation shall be limited to (A) whether the Closing
Statement was properly calculated in accordance with the  definitions in this
Agreement and the Accounting Principles, (B) the proposed resolution of each
disputed issue by such Party and (C) reasonable supporting detail for the
foregoing). Seller and Purchaser shall also instruct the Independent  Expert
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to render its reasoned written
decision within 30 days from the date that information related to the
unresolved objections is presented to the Independent Expert by Seller and
Purchaser. With  respect to each disputed line item, such decision shall be
made in strict accordance with the terms and definitions within this Agreement
and the Accounting Principles and, if not in accordance with the position of
either Seller or Purchaser,  shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less
than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the Closing Statement
or Seller in the Notice of Objection with respect to such disputed line item.
Except as Seller and Purchaser may  otherwise agree, all communications
between Seller and Purchaser or any of their respective Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Independent Expert, on the other hand, shall be in
writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the  non-communicating Party.
None of Seller, Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have
any ex parte communications or meetings with the Independent Expert regarding
the subject matter hereof without the other Party's prior written  consent.
The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final,
binding and conclusive on, and enforceable by, the Parties (absent manifest
error). All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne on a 
proportionate basis by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other,
based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded
in favor of each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party.
By way of  illustration, if Purchaser's calculations would have resulted in a
$1,000,000 net payment to Purchaser, and Seller's calculations would have
resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to Seller and the Independent Expert's
final determination as  adopted pursuant to this Section 2.04(b)(ii) results
in an aggregate net payment of $500,000 to Seller, then Purchaser and Seller
shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses.

 

 

 

 

25  

(c) _Adjustment Payment_.   Within five Business Days after the Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, Transaction Expenses,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Tax Amount and the Purchase Price have been
finally determined in accordance with Section 2.04(b),  (i) if the Estimated
Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
the amount of such shortfall, and (ii) if the Estimated Purchase Price is
greater than the Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount  of
such excess. For Tax purposes, any payment by Purchaser or Seller under this
Section 2.04(c) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any
payment under this Section 2.04(c) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately  available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be (such designation to be made at least three
Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is due).

Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.07. _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Attached to Section 3.07(a) of  the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a true,
correct and complete copy of (i) the audited consolidated statement of
operations, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of cash flows
and consolidated statement of changes in member's equity  for the Company
Group as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2019, including the notes and schedules thereto, accompanied by the reports
thereon of the Company Group's independent auditors for the years then ended 
and (ii) the unaudited consolidated statement of operations, consolidated
balance sheet, consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated statement
of changes in member's equity for the Company Group as of and for the six
months ended June 30,  2020 (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet_ " and the date
of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet Date_ " and
such statements, collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ ") and the
comparable prior period, including  the notes and schedules thereto,
accompanied by the reports thereon of the Company Group's independent
auditors.

 

 

29  

(b) The Financial Statements, and any  additional financial statements
(including the Audited Annual Carve-out Financials and the Unaudited Quarterly
Carve-out Financials) and any updated financial statements provided pursuant
to Section 5.16(h) _(ii)_ and Section 5.16(h) _(iii)_   when delivered
pursuant to Section 5.16 (in each case, including the notes, if any, thereto),
(i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
throughout the periods indicated ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such 
unaudited financial statements do not contain notes and are subject to normal
year-end adjustments (none of which will, individually or in the aggregate,
materially alter the financial condition of the Company Group presented by
such unaudited  financial statements)), (ii) have been prepared in all
material respects from, and in accordance with, the books and records of the
Company Group (except, in each case (A) as noted therein, and (B) subject to
the absence of notes) and (iii) fairly  present in all material respects the
financial condition of the Company Group and the operating results of the
Company Group (in each case, in the aggregate, as of the applicable dates or
for the applicable periods). The Company Group maintains a  system of
internal accounting controls appropriate for companies of a similar size and
stage and are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that, in all material
respects: (1) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
general or  specific authorizations and (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP and to maintain asset accountability. The accounts receivables of each of
the Company and the Company  Subsidiary shown in the balance sheets in the
Financial Statements and in any additional financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 5.16 arise from bona fide transactions engaged in or
entered into by each of the Company and Company  Subsidiary, as applicable,
in the ordinary course of business and to the Knowledge of Seller, are not
subject to any material claim of offset, recoupment or counterclaim;
_provided_ that, the foregoing is not a guarantee that accounts  receivable
will be collected.

 

(c) The Financial Statements are  qualified by the fact that the Company
Group has not operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within Seller and
its Affiliates. As a result, the Company Group has been allocated certain
internal charges and credits for purposes of the  preparation of the
Financial Statements. Such allocations of charges and credits have been made
in good faith with the intent of accurately presenting to the extent
practicable the financial condition and results of operations of the Company
Group  for the time periods covered by the Financial Statements, but may not
necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted from arms-length
transactions or the actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company
Group had operated as an  independent enterprise during such periods.

 

SECTION 3.08. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor the
Company Subsidiary has any Liabilities, except for those Liabilities:

 

(a) reflected, reserved against or  disclosed in the Most Recent Balance
Sheet;

 

(b) that will be included in the  calculation of Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness or Closing Tax Amount;

 

 

30  

(c) incurred in the ordinary course  of business since the Most Recent
Balance Sheet Date (none of which, individually or in the aggregate, are
material to the Company Group, taken as a whole or arose in connection with a
breach of Contract or Permit, breach of warranty, tort or  infringement or
violation of Law (without giving effect to the proviso in the definition
thereof));

 

(d) for future performance under  Contracts or Permits (other than
Liabilities for any breach of or non-performance under such Contracts or
Permits by any Company Group);

 

(e) incurred pursuant to or arising  under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

 

(f) that, individually or in the  aggregate, would not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, be material to the Company Group, taken as a whole.

 

SECTION 3.09. _Absence of Changes_. Except as set forth on Section 3.09 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2019, (a) except in connection
with or in preparation for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
the Business has been conducted in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business, (b) through the date of this Agreement, there has not been
a Material Adverse Effect and (c) none of the Company Group has taken any
action that, if taken  after the date hereof, would require the prior consent
of Purchaser pursuant to _clauses_ (ii), (vii), _(ix)_ , (x), (xi), (xii),
(xiii), (xix) or (xx) of Section 5.01(b).

 

SECTION 3.10. _Real Property_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor the  Company Subsidiary owns, nor has owned since
the Lookback Date, any real property, nor is the Company or the Company
Subsidiary party to an agreement to purchase real property or an interest in
real property.

 

(b) Section 3.10(b) of the Seller  Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all real property leased,

agreement is necessary or desirable, Seller or one of its Subsidiaries shall
enter into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement
with Purchaser  and its Affiliates with respect to any information to be
provided to Seller pursuant to this Section 5.02(b). Prior to incurring any
material out-of-pocket expenses associated with requests made by Seller under
this Section 5.02(b), Purchaser and  Seller shall discuss and agree in
writing on the estimated amount of such expenses; provided that Purchaser
shall have no obligation to incur any expense which is not agreed upon by

longer time as may be required by Law or Educational Law.

 

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the  information provided to it and its
Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 5.02(a), is
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,

and its Affiliates' obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate with respect to information subject thereto to the extent relating
to the Company  Group or the Business and (ii) nothing in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall prevent Purchaser from enforcing its rights or defending
itself against claims based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents or the transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

 

62  

(b) From the Closing until the fifth  anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Confidentiality Period_ "), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, (i) treat and hold as confidential, and not disclose or
provide access to any Person other than (A) Seller's  Affiliates and
Representatives on a need-to-know basis for the purpose of performing their

any Proceeding, in which case Seller shall, to the extent legally permitted,
consult with Purchaser prior to making any disclosure and give Purchaser a
reasonably opportunity to comment thereon (the  purposes in _clauses (A)_
through _(D)_ , the " _Purpose_ ") or (E) solely with respect to information
that relates generally to Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses, and not specifically to the Company Group or  the Business, to
third parties in connection with such third parties' due diligence concerning
a potential sale of Seller or one of its Subsidiaries or all or substantially
all of their respective assets (other than a sale of the Business or the 
Company Group (except in connection with a sale of Seller or the majority of
Seller's assets)), subject to a customary confidentiality agreement, which
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce with respect to
information related to  the Company Group or the Business, including at
Purchaser's request, the terms of this Agreement and all information with
respect to the Business, the Company, the Company Subsidiary, the University
or Purchaser or its Affiliates, or any of their  businesses, Permits or other
regulatory matters or activities, any payments made hereunder, any
indemnification claims hereunder and all other confidential or proprietary
information with respect to the Company Group, the University or Purchaser
or  its Affiliates (" _Confidential Information_ ") and (ii) not use any
Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose. In the event
that, during the Confidentiality Period, Seller or Seller's Affiliates or
Representatives becomes  legally compelled to disclose any such Confidential
Information, (A) Seller shall, to the extent permissible and reasonably
practicable, provide Purchaser with prompt written notice of such requirement
so that Purchaser may seek a protective order  or other remedy or waive
compliance with this Section 5.03(b) (and, if Purchaser seeks such a
protective order or other remedy, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser's efforts  related
thereto) and (B) in the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, or Purchaser waives compliance with this Section 5.03(b), the
Person so compelled to disclose Confidential Information shall furnish only
that portion  of such Confidential Information that is legally required to be
provided and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, at Purchaser's
expense, to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Confidential Information
shall not include any information that is (1) available publicly through no
violation by Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives of this Section
5.03(b) or (2) was not previously known by Seller, any of  its Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives and was after the Closing disclosed to
Seller, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser, any of its Affiliates 
or any of their respective Representatives who was not known by Seller, its
Affiliates or any of such Representatives to be in violation of any duty of
confidentiality. Seller shall be responsible for any non-compliance with, or
breach of, this  Section 5.03 by any of its Affiliates or Representatives.

withheld in Purchaser's sole discretion), shall the Company Group, (A) make
proposals, execute, agree or  consent to or carry out agreements or submit to
any Judgment (1) providing for the sale or other disposition or holding

64  

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall, and  Seller shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company Group) to, promptly supply the other with any
information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings or
application pursuant to Section 5.04(a). Subject to any Law or  Educational
Law relating to the exchange of information, the Confidentiality Agreement,
and the preservation of any applicable attorney-client privilege, work-product
doctrine, self-audit privilege or other similar privilege, Purchaser and
Seller  shall, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company
Group) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collaborate in reviewing and
commenting on in advance, and to consult the other on, information relating to
the Company Group,  Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party, any
Governmental Authority or any Educational Agency in connection with any filing
or Proceeding in connection with  this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In connection with such collaboration, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company
Group) to, act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 

(d) Purchaser and Seller each shall  notify the other promptly upon its (and
in the case of Seller, any of its Affiliates' (including the Company Group's))
receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Authority
or Educational Agency in connection with any  filings made pursuant hereto
and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Authority or
Educational Agency for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with,  any Law
or Educational Law. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.04(a),
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of
such  occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Authority or Educational Agency such amendment or supplement.

 

SECTION 5.05. _Educational Approvals_. Without limiting the generality of
Section 5.04:

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate and  use reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Pre-Closing Educational Consents necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Parties
will coordinate regarding the prompt submission to all  applicable
Educational Agencies of all letters, notices, applications or other documents
required to obtain the Pre-Closing Educational Consents. At reasonable and
practicable times following the date hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall, and
Seller  shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to, make all
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, application or submission of other documents required by any

including, (A) the DOE Preacquisition Application and the Notice to the
Minnesota Office of Higher Education no later than 30 days from the date

application with the Higher Learning Commission by October 30, 2020. Each
Party shall provide the other with: (i) reasonable advance review and
consultation regarding any notices or applications to be filed with any
Educational Agency  with respect to any Pre-Closing Educational Consent; and
(ii) a copy of any notice or application as filed with, or any notice received
from, any Educational Agency with respect to any Pre-Closing Educational
Consent. The Parties will pursue the  comprehensive pre-acquisition review
process provided by the DOE. To the extent practical, prior to attending any
meetings, telephone calls or discussions with any Educational Agency
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the  Parties
shall discuss and agree upon strategy and issues to be pursued and responses
to likely questions. The Parties will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that their appropriate officers and employees shall be
available to  attend, as any Educational Agency may reasonably request, any
scheduled meetings or telephone calls in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

65  

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing,  to the extent that the DOE issues a DOE
preacquisition review letter containing conditions that result in such letter
not meeting the definition of "DOE Preacquisition Response" or containing a
Burdensome Condition, or an Educational Agency denies  any material Pre-
Closing Educational Consent listed on _Section 6.01(c)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the Parties shall, during the Pre-Closing Period, use
reasonable best efforts to resolve, eliminate, mitigate, or reduce the impact
of  such condition prior to the End Date. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 5.05(b)_ does not limit Purchaser's rights pursuant to _Section
7.01(c)(ii)_ (provided Purchaser is not then in material breach of _Section
5.05(b)_ )  or the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01(c)(i)_.

 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period,  and subject to the applicable Educational
Law and instructions of any Educational Agency, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser copies of any material correspondence relating to any (i) adverse
change in the status of any Educational Approval or (ii)  Compliance Review
of the University that could be reasonably expected to result in the loss of
an Educational Approval.

 

(d) The Parties hereby acknowledge  that the board of managers of the
University is the governing body of the University, and is charged with
maintaining its accreditation and academic standards, and accordingly, the
Parties agree that consultation with the board of managers of the  University
is an integral aspect of the integration preparation and review process during
the Pre-Closing Period. The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to
facilitate meetings from time to time, as may be necessary, advisable or as 
reasonably requested by the board of managers of the University, between
representatives of the Purchaser and members of the board of managers of the
University, for the purpose of keeping the board of managers of the University
reasonably informed  of the Purchaser's expectations with respect to the
University's educational mission and community impact following the Closing.

 

SECTION 5.06. _Intercompany Accounts_. All intercompany accounts as of the
Closing Date between Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company Group),
on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand, shall be settled
in  full or, at the option of Seller, but only to the extent permitted by
Law, cancelled or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as Seller shall
determine, in each case on or prior to the Closing Date and prior to the
Closing.

 

 

66  

SECTION 5.07. _Pre-Closing IP Transfer_.

 

(a) Seller shall, or shall cause its  Affiliates (other than the Company
Group) to, prior to the Closing, enter into and deliver to the Company Group
agreements in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, to irrevocably
transfer to the Company Group all of such Persons' right, title  and interest
in and to any and all Intellectual Property registrations and applications (i)
for which Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company Group) are the
owner of record at the applicable Governmental Authority and (ii) that are 
exclusively or primarily used or held for use in connection with the Business,
including those registrations and applications on Section 5.07(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (the execution and delivery of such agreements, the
" _Pre-Closing  IP Transfer_ "), and, at Seller's sole cost and expense, file
to record such agreements with the applicable Governmental Authority. Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller shall, prior to Closing and at its sole cost
and expense, (A) deliver  all passwords to the Company Group and take such
other actions as are reasonably necessary in accordance with the procedures of
the applicable Domain Name and Social Identifier registrars to effectuate and
evidence the above transfer of ownership  and control (including
administrative and technical access) to the Company Group of all Domain Names
and the primary Social Identifiers for each social media venue on Section
5.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; and (B) use commercially 
reasonable efforts to deliver all passwords to the Company Group and take such
other actions as are reasonably necessary in accordance with the procedures of
the applicable Social Identifier registrars to effectuate and evidence the
above transfer  of ownership and control (including administrative and
technical access) to the Company Group of all other Social Identifiers
included in the Owned Intellectual Property for each social media venue on
Section 5.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure  Schedule. Without limiting any
other provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents, with respect to
any Social Identifiers where Seller is not able to, or does not, deliver the
passwords to the Company Group or otherwise take such other  actions as are
reasonably necessary in accordance with the procedures of the applicable
Social Identifier registrars to effectuate and evidence the above transfer of
ownership and control (including administrative and technical access) to the 
Company Group of such Social Identifiers before Closing, Seller will, at its
sole cost and expense, complete such tasks promptly, and in any event within
30 days, after the Closing, at the reasonable direction of Purchaser.

 

(b) Prior to the consummation of the  Pre-Closing IP Transfer, at Seller's
sole cost and expense, Seller shall make (or, if applicable shall cause its
Affiliates, other than the Company Group, to make) filings with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States  Copyright Office and
with the registries and other recording Governmental Authorities in all
foreign jurisdictions, as applicable, to ensure (i) that the chain of title of
each registration or pending application for registration for each Owned 
Registered IP asset subject to the Pre-Closing IP Transfer reflects all prior
acquisitions and transfers of such item (including between Seller and its
Affiliates) and (ii) that Seller (or if applicable, its Affiliate) shall be
identified in the  records of the applicable Governmental Authority as the
then-current owner of record, without any break in chain of title, of each
such Owned Registered IP asset subject to the Pre-Closing IP Transfer, free
and clear of all Liens (other than  Permitted Liens).

 

(c) If, following the Closing,  Purchaser, the Company Group or Seller
discovers or identifies any Intellectual Property registrations or
applications (i) for which Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company
Group) are the owner of record  at the applicable Governmental Authority, and
(ii) that are exclusively or primarily used or held for use in connection with
the Business, but that were omitted from Section 5.07(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, it shall notify the other Party, and Seller or its
Affiliates shall promptly, and at Seller's sole cost and expense, (A) enter
into agreements in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, to transfer to
the Company Group all of  such Persons' right, title and interest in and to
any and all such Intellectual Property registrations and applications and (B)
file to record such agreements with the applicable Governmental Authority.

 

 

67  

SECTION 5.08. _Seller Marks_.

 

(a) Purchaser, on behalf of itself  and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company Group) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Parties_ "),
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the license provided in Section
5.08(b) herein, the Purchaser Parties are not acquiring  and shall have no
right, title, interest, license or any other rights in or to use the Seller
Marks after the Closing Date. Purchaser covenants that, after the Closing
Date, none of the Purchaser Parties shall (A) use, register or seek to use
or  register in any jurisdiction any of the Seller Marks or any other
Trademarks confusingly similar thereto or (B) contest the use, ownership,
validity or enforceability of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in
or to any of the Seller  Marks, except in each case in enforcing its rights
under Section 5.07(a). After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not (and shall
cause the Purchaser Parties not to) represent that it has authority to bind
Seller or any of its Affiliates to any  Third Party obligation.

 

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause  the other Purchaser Parties to, cease
and discontinue any use of the Seller Marks and, at Purchaser's sole cost and
expense, remove all Seller Marks from all such Existing Materials (as defined
below), as promptly as possible after the Closing Date  and in any event
within 180 days thereafter. Subject to the foregoing, Seller hereby grants to
the Purchaser Parties, effective as of the Closing, a non-exclusive, royalty-
free, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, transitional license to use the 
Seller Marks for a period of 180 days following the Closing Date solely on
signage and materials that were created by the Company Group prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Existing Materials_ "), solely in a manner consistent
with past practice  and customary "phase out" use. All goodwill derived from
the use of the Seller Marks as permitted hereunder shall inure solely to the
benefit of Seller and its Affiliates.

 

SECTION 5.09. _Publicity_. Neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor Seller, on
the other hand, will issue or permit any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives to issue any press release, website posting or other public 
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by Law,  Educational Law or stock exchange rules or regulations (in
which case whichever of Purchaser or its Affiliates or Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, are required to make the release or statement shall
(a) consult with the other Party (whether  or not such other Party is named
in such release or statement) at a reasonable time prior to its issuance to
allow the other Party to comment on such release or statement in advance of
such issuance, (b) consider in good faith any comments timely  provided by
such other Party to such release or statement and (c) after such release or
statement, provide the other Party with a copy thereof (or summary thereof in
the case of oral statements)); _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser  and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other
hand, may, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, make public
announcements and engage in public communications regarding this Agreement and
the  transactions contemplated hereby to the extent such announcements or
communications are entirely consistent with the Parties' prior public

shall use commercially reasonably efforts to transfer the engagement of any
Potential Transferee to the Company Group no later than the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date. No later than 20 days prior to the Closing  Date,
Purchaser (i) with respect to any Potential Transferee who resides in the
United States, shall extend an offer of employment or engagement or (ii) with
respect to any Potential Transferee who does not reside in the United States,
unless an  offer of employment required by applicable Law, may extend an
offer of employment or engagement, in each case, to each such Potential
Transferee whose employment or engagement did not transfer to the Company
Group prior to the Closing Date on terms  that comply with Section 5.11(b),
and following such Potential Transferee's acceptance of such offer of
employment, such Potential Transferee shall be a Continuing Employee for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

69  

(b) For a period of one year  following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, an
applicable Continuing Employee's termination date) (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
provide to each Service Provider who is in the  employment of the Company or
the Company Subsidiary immediately following the Closing (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with, (i) a base salary or base wage rate that is no
less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate provided to such 
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, as indicated in the
Service Provider Census that is provided pursuant to last sentence of this
Section 5.11(b), (ii) a target annual cash incentive opportunity that is no
less favorable than the  target annual cash incentive opportunity provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, as indicated in the
Service Provider Census that is provided pursuant to last sentence of this
Section 5.11(b), and (iii) other employee  benefits (other than equity-based
compensation), in each case, that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or
an Affiliate of Purchaser. In addition, solely with  respect to any Service
Provider who received an ordinary course annual equity-based compensation
award from Seller or its Affiliates during the 12 month period immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement, during the Continuation Period, such 
Service Provider shall receive equity-based compensation that has (x) an
aggregate grant date value that is no less favorable than the aggregate grant
date value of any equity based compensation granted to such Service Provider
as part of the last  ordinary course annual grant cycle of Seller or its
Affiliates occurring prior to the Closing and (y) terms (including vesting
terms) that are substantially similar to the equity-based compensation granted
to similarly-situated employees of  Purchaser or its Affiliates (or, if no
similarly situated employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates receive equity-
based compensation, substantially similar to the terms of equity-based
compensation granted to employees at a level above such Service  Provider);
provided, that in Purchaser's discretion, such equity-based compensation may
be settled in (1) the same class of equity that equity-based compensation
granted to similarly-situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates is
settled in  or (2) cash. The Service Provider Census shall be updated by
Seller at least two Business Days prior to the Closing to include the name of
each Service Provider and to include each Service Provider's equity-based
compensation, if any, granted in  the year prior to Closing and target annual
cash incentive opportunity provided to such Service Provider immediately prior
to the Closing; _provided_ that the Parties have entered into any standard
agreements required to be entered into under  applicable privacy Law with
respect to the provision of such information and the Parties will use good
faith, commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate such agreements.

 

(c) Purchaser shall, or shall cause  its applicable Affiliates to, provide to
each Continuing Employee who incurs a termination of employment during the one
year period following the Closing Date with severance payments and severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the  severance payments and

70  

(d) From and after the Closing Date,  subject to Section 5.11, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, (i) honor all obligations
existing on the Closing Date under the Sponsored Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms (including terms permitting  reduction of
benefits and plan amendment and termination), (ii) assume all Liabilities
associated with accrued but unused vacation and paid time off balances of any
Continuing Employees, and shall credit and honor, in accordance with the terms
of  the applicable policy of Seller or its Subsidiaries, all vacation days
and other paid time off accrued but not yet taken by the Continuing Employees
(including terms permitting reduction of benefits and plan amendment and
termination) (other than  any Potential Transferees deemed to be Continuing
Employees pursuant to Section 5.11(a), who receive a payout of accrued
vacation and paid time off balances in connection with termination of
employment from Seller or its Affiliate), and (iii) pay  any accrued bonus
Liabilities and accrued severance Liabilities constituting Indebtedness (as
finally determined in accordance with _Section_ 2.04) to Continuing Employees
on or prior to March 15 of the calendar year following the year in  which the
Closing occurs or on any later date when payments are scheduled to be made.

 

(e) Purchaser shall, or shall cause  its Affiliates to, give each Continuing
Employee full credit for such Continuing Employees' service with Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
the level of benefits (including, for purposes of  vacation and severance)
under any benefit plans made generally available to employees maintained by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for which such Continuing Employee is
otherwise eligible (but such service credit shall not be provided for 
benefit accrual purposes, except for purposes of vacation and severance, as
applicable) to the same extent recognized by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that service
of a  Continuing Employee with Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall not be
recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive
benefits with respect to, any retiree medical programs or other retiree
welfare benefit programs  maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service.

 

(f) Purchaser shall use commercially  reasonable efforts, or shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its applicable Affiliates, as
applicable, to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under  any
plan of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that provides health benefits in
which Continuing Employees participate following the Closing Date (a "
_Purchaser Plan_ "), (ii) if applicable, honor, for the balance of the plan
year of the  Purchaser Plan, any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under the analogous Seller Benefit Plan during the elapsed portion of the plan
year of such Seller Benefit Plan  in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums under the Purchaser Plan and (iii) waive any waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise
be applicable to a Continuing Employee and his  or her eligible dependents
under a Purchaser Plan to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible
dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous Seller Benefit Plan immediately prior to such commencement of 
participation in which Seller Benefit Plan the Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

71  

(g) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser  shall maintain a defined contribution
retirement plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") for the benefit of those Continuing Employees in
the United States who shall elect to participate in the  Purchaser 401(k)
Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable on or following the Closing Date, but
in no event later than 60 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
for those Continuing Employees who elect and are eligible to participate in 
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, allow such Continuing Employees to make a "direct
rollover" to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of any account balance under the
defined contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code that they  participated in prior to the Closing, and Purchaser
shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept as rollover contributions, all
account balances (which shall include any vested employer contributions
accrued) through the Closing Date and all  outstanding loans.

 

(h) Nothing in this Agreement,  including this Section 5.11, shall confer
upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of
Seller, the Company Group, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of  Purchaser, the Company
Group or any Affiliate of Purchaser, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the 
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Purchaser,
the Company Group, any Affiliate of Purchaser and the Continuing Employee or
any severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy or program covering
such Continuing  Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Seller Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent  Purchaser, the Company Group or any Affiliate of
Purchaser from amending or terminating any Seller Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or (iii) create any third party
rights in any current or former service provider of  the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

(a) As an inducement to Purchaser to  enter into this Agreement and each of
the Ancillary Documents and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby and for other good and sufficient consideration, Seller, with the

in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document shall be  interpreted to release
Purchaser from any of its obligations to Seller under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document.

 

 

72

and Representatives) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate

Competing  Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Qualifying 
Transaction shall not be considered a "Competing Transaction." Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to, instruct

the Person making such Transaction Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of any such Transaction  Proposal. Any violation of the

Company Group) or (C) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction which would result, directly
or indirectly, in the disposition of more than 50% of the assets, equity or
other property of Seller,  in each case whether in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, in each case of _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and
_(C)_ , in which (1) each potential purchaser or other participant
participating in any process in relation thereto is  bound by a customary
confidentiality and non-use agreement covering any information related to the
Company Group or the Business and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to enforce such confidentiality agreements with respect to  information
related to the Company Group or the Business, including, following the
Closing, at Purchaser's request and (2) the purchaser or surviving party
thereunder agrees to be, or by operation of Law will be, bound by the terms of
this  Agreement and the Ancillary Documents applicable to Seller and any
remaining obligations of Seller under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents (including the obligation to consummate the Closing) will be fully
assumed by such Person  (including by operation of Law, if applicable);
_provided_ that notwithstanding the occurrence of any Qualifying Transaction,
Seller or its Affiliates, as  applicable, shall remain responsible and liable
for its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and any Ancillary Document to
which Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, are a party.

communication  received from any Person alleging that the Consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) any material written notice or other written communication from
any Governmental Authority or  Educational Agency in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall not affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made  by either Party or limit or
otherwise operate as a waiver or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the receiving Party or any right of such receiving Party not to consummate the
transactions contemplated in accordance with Section 6.01,  Section 6.02 or
Section 6.03, as applicable.

 

SECTION 5.15. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

legitimate interests of the Business as those interests exist as of the date
hereof.

lease, manage, control, engage in, invest in or permit its name to be used by
any business that competes with the Business in the United States, Canada or 
the Caribbean by targeting for recruitment, or actively marketing to, students
in such territories (" _Competitive Activities_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions on conduct of Competitive Activities set forth in
this Section  5.15(b) shall not be deemed breached solely as a result of (i)
the passive ownership by any Seller Restricted Parties, collectively, of less
than an aggregate of five percent of the outstanding securities of a Person
engaged, directly or  indirectly, in Competitive Activities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such securities are listed on a national securities exchange;
(ii) the passive ownership by any Seller Restricted Parties, collectively, of
less than five percent in  value of the outstanding voting debt of a Person

(iii)_ , within the three month period immediately following the consummation
of the purchase or other acquisition of such After-Acquired Business in
accordance with the definitive documentation thereof the  applicable Seller
Restricted Party, executes a definitive agreement for the sale of all (but not
less than all) of the Competitive Activities of such After-Acquired Business
to a Third Party, which sale is consummated no later than 12 months 
following execution of such definitive agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such 12 month period shall be extended for an additional period not to
exceed 90 days as is necessary to obtain any competition or educational
regulatory  approvals required to complete such divestiture if Seller and its
Affiliates and such acquiring party are using commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such approvals; _provided_ , _further_ , that the restrictions on
conduct of  Competitive Activities set forth in this Section 5.15 __ shall
apply with respect to the After-Acquired Business until such divestiture is
consummated, unless the (A) After-Acquired Business conducts any Competitive
Activities, directly or  indirectly, separately from the other activities of
the applicable Seller Restricted Parties, (B) After-Acquired Business does
not, directly or indirectly, use any Confidential Information or Intellectual
Property primarily related to the Business  (it being understood that the
Seller Marks are not deemed to be primarily or exclusively related to the
Business) in the conduct of any Competitive Activities, and (C) the applicable
Seller Restricted Parties and After-Acquired Business implement  reasonable
procedures designed to ensure that the foregoing requirements are satisfied.
For purposes hereof, " _After-Acquired Business_ " means any business activity
that would violate the restrictions on conduct of Competitive Activities set 
forth in Section 5.15(b) that is acquired from any Person or is carried on by
any Person that is acquired by or combined with Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller; _provided_ that such Person was, at the time of such acquisition or
combination,  not an Affiliate of any applicable Seller Restricted Party, as
applicable, in each case, after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 5.15, this Section 5.15 shall not apply
to or restrict (1) any  Subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller as of such time as
such Person is no longer a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller, and any Person
that purchases assets, operations or a business from Seller or its
Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates if such  Person is not a Subsidiary or
controlled Affiliate of Seller or its direct or indirect equityholders after
such transaction is consummated and (2) any Third Party acquiror of Seller,
any of its Affiliates or all or substantially all of any of their  respective
assets; _provided_ that, with respect to _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ , during the
period specified in this Section 5.15(b) _,_ (x) any such acquiring party and
its Affiliates conduct any Competitive Activities, directly  and indirectly,
separately from the business of Seller, (y) any such acquiring party and its
Affiliates or divested Person do not, directly or indirectly, use any
Confidential Information or Intellectual Property primarily related to the
Business  (it being understood that the Seller Marks are not deemed to be
primarily related to the Business) in the conduct of any Competitive
Activities, and (z) any such acquiring party or divested Person and its
Affiliates implement reasonable procedures  designed to ensure that the
foregoing requirements are satisfied. Seller shall be responsible for any non-
compliance with, or breach of, this Section 5.15(b) by any of the Related
Parties as if such Persons were a party hereto and bound in the  same manner
as Seller.

 

(c) For a period of two years from  and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
not and shall cause the other Seller Restricted Parties, and shall direct each
director of Seller and manager of the Company Group, not to, directly or
indirectly solicit, recruit or hire any employee or  officer of the Company
Group as of the Closing Date or any time during the Pre-Closing Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to the
solicitation, recruitment or hiring of any individual (i) as a  result of
general advertisements and solicitations (including by Third Party search
firms or recruiter contacts) or other broad-based hiring methods not
specifically targeted to any particular employee or group of employees, unless
such  advertisement, solicitation or other hiring method is intentionally
undertaken as a means to circumvent the restrictions contained in, or conceal
a violation of, this Section 5.15(c), (ii) who at such time is no longer, and
has not been for 365  days, an employee of Purchaser, the Company Group or
any of their respective Affiliates or (iii) who was terminated after the
Closing by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company Group).
Seller shall be responsible for any  non-compliance with, or breach of, this
Section 5.15(c) by any of the Related Parties or any director or Seller or
manager of the Company Group as if such Persons were a party hereto and bound
in the same manner as Seller.

expected to become public, make disparaging remarks regarding, concerning or
alluding to the University, the Business, the Company Group or Purchaser that
is intended to or would be reasonably likely to (i) materially injure or 
embarrass the subject of such statements or (ii) place the subject of such
statement in a false light before the public in any material respect. Seller
shall be responsible for any non-compliance with, or breach of, this Section
5.15(d) by any of  the Related Parties or any director or Seller or manager
of the Company Group as if such Persons were a party hereto and bound in the
same manner as Seller.

 

(e) For a period of two years from  and after the date hereof, Purchaser
shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and direct each
director of Purchaser and manager of the Company Group not to, directly or
indirectly: solicit, recruit or hire any employee or officer  of Seller (i)
who at such time is involved in providing services under the Transition

whom Purchaser or its Affiliates came into contact, directly or indirectly, or
who  (or whose performance) becomes known to Purchaser or its Affiliates, in

SECTION 5.16. _Financing_.

 

(a) Unless, and to the extent,  Purchaser shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of Seller that Purchaser shall have sufficient cash
from other sources (including by reason of capital markets, securities or
other financing transactions) (such sources, " _Alternative   Financing
Sources_ ") available (including through customary escrow arrangements) to
satisfy the Financing Uses, from and after the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done,
all  things reasonably necessary or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing as
soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, not later than the Closing
Date, on substantially the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
applicable, the "flex"  provisions), taken as a whole, described in the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter, including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on
substantially the terms and conditions  (as such terms may be modified or
adjusted solely in accordance with the terms, and within the limits, of the
flex provisions contained in any Fee Letter) or otherwise in a manner not
materially adverse to Seller (the " _Definitive Debt Financing  Agreements_
") and (ii) satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to and within the control of Purchaser in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and enforce its rights 
thereunder.

 

(b) Unless, and to the extent,  Purchaser shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of Seller that Purchaser shall have sufficient cash
from Alternative Financing Sources available (including through customary
escrow arrangements) to satisfy the Financing Uses, from  and after the
execution of this Agreement, if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter,
Purchaser shall  use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
Closing Date as required by Section 2.02(a), arrange and obtain from the same
or alternative sources of debt financing in an  amount, when combined with
any equity financing and cash on hand, that is sufficient to satisfy the
Financing Uses, on terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that
are not materially less favorable to Purchaser in the aggregate as  those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter and which
shall not include any conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of
such alternative debt financing on the Closing Date that are materially more
onerous  than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related
Fee Letter in effect on the date hereof. The new debt commitment letter and
fee letter entered into in connection with such alternative debt financing are
referred to,  respectively, as a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ " and a "
_New Fee Letter_." Purchaser shall provide the Company with fully executed
copies of the New Debt Commitment Letter and any related New Fee Letter (with
the fee amounts, pricing  caps and the economic terms of the "flex"
provisions contained therein redacted and other customary redactions that do
not materially adversely affect the conditionality of such alternative debt
financing) as promptly as practicable following the  execution thereof. In
the event Purchaser enters into any such New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means the
debt financing contemplated by the "Debt Commitment Letter" as such  term is
modified pursuant to the immediately succeeding _clause (ii)_ , (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the
definition of  Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent then in effect and  (iii) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Fee Letter" (and any definition incorporating the term "Fee Letter,"
including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be
deemed to include the Fee Letter to the extent not  superseded by a New Fee
Letter at the time in question and any New Fee Letter to the extent then in
effect.

 

 

78  

(c) Unless, and to the extent,  Purchaser shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of Seller that Purchaser shall have sufficient cash
from Alternative Financing Sources available (including through customary
escrow arrangements) to satisfy the Financing Uses, from  and after the
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall not agree to nor permit any
termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or
waiver of any of its rights under, the Debt  Commitment Letter without
Seller's prior written consent to the extent such termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver would (i) add new conditions
(or modify any existing  condition) to the consummation or availability of
the Debt Financing as compared to those in the Debt Commitment Letter as of
the date hereof in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Purchaser to obtain the  Debt Financing, (ii) reduce
the amount of the Debt Financing such that the aggregate funds that would be
available on the Closing Date, together with other immediately available
financial resources of Purchaser, would not be sufficient to pay the 
Financing Uses, or (iii) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the consummation of the Closing; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Section  5.16(c) to the contrary, the Debt
Commitment Letter may be amended or supplemented to add or replace lenders,
lead arrangers, underwriters, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of  the date
hereof. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller executed copies of any
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver of the Debt
Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall have the right to substitute the proceeds
of any  Alternative Financing Source for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter by reducing commitments
under the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event Purchaser enters  into any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification or waiver, (A)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" means the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as  amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with this Section 5.16(c) and
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter,"  including the
definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) means the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended, replaced, supplemented,
modified or waived in accordance with this  Section 5.16(c).

contractual obligations, the other Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with such Party and its counsel in the defense or contest

personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records as

as of the Closing, to be in material violation of or material default under,
any letters of credit, performance  bonds, surety bonds or similar
instruments required by any Educational Agency or Governmental Authority or
pursuant to any Material Contract to Permit; _provided_ _further_ that Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use  reasonable best efforts to
cause the amount of the Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company Group

proprietary and confidential information relating to strategic, technical,
or  marketing plans of Seller and its Subsidiaries and direct and indirect

agrees that it will, and it will cause the Company Group to, treat such
information as required by the Confidentiality  Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.26. _Replacement of Guarantees_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable  following the date of this Agreement,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the complete and unconditional release of Seller and its applicable Affiliates
and direct and indirect equityholders from those  guarantees, letters of
credit, surety bonds, indemnities and similar obligations with respect to the
Business set forth on Section 5.26(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each,
an " _Existing Guaranty_ ") (each release from an Existing  Guaranty a "
_Guaranty Release_ "); _provided_ that no such Guaranty Release shall be
effective prior to the Closing if it would reasonably be expected to cause the
lapse, termination or breach of, or failure to comply with, or  acceleration
of any right or obligation under any Law, Educational Law, Educational
Approval, Permit, or Material Contract in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the operation of the Business or the assets or property of
the  Company Group, taken as a whole. Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
that obtaining the Guaranty Releases is not a condition to the Closing. If
requested by a party in whose favor an Existing Guaranty was made (a "
_Guaranteed Party_ "),  effective at the Closing Purchaser shall (i) (A)
execute a substitute guaranty on terms no less favorable to Purchaser than the
guarantor under the Existing Guaranty or (B) cause a successor guarantor to
execute a substitute guaranty on terms no  less favorable to such successor
guarantor than the guarantor under the Existing Guaranty (a " _Substitute
Guaranty_ ") in order to secure such Guaranty Release and (ii) provide all
documentation as may be reasonably required to obtain such  Guaranty Release.
Purchaser may reasonably request that the recipient of such Substitute
Guaranty agree to customary confidentiality restrictions with respect to any
confidential information requested by the Guaranteed Party. Each of Seller
and  Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep the other
Party informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to obtain each Guaranty Release and concurrently provide to the
other Party copies  of all documents provided to or from a Guaranteed Party
related to obtaining each Guaranty Release. Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide Seller all cooperation reasonably requested by Seller
that is necessary in connection  with obtaining such Guaranty Releases;
_provided_ that, other than with respect to Purchaser's obligation to provide
a Substitute Guaranty, neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be required
to pay money to the Guaranteed Party or any  other Third Party, commence any
Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to the
Guaranteed Party or any other Third Party in connection with Seller's efforts
to obtain a Guaranty Release. Each Party shall use  commercially reasonable
efforts to give the other Parties advance notice of any in-person meeting or
conference with the Guaranteed Party relating to a Guaranty Release or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall permit Representatives of the 
other Parties to be present at those meetings or conferences. From and after
the Closing, each Party shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain any Guaranty Releases not received prior to the Closing, and in such
case shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless, and compensate and
reimburse, the other Party and its Affiliates and direct and indirect
equityholders with respect to all liabilities or obligations arising out of or
relating to any such Existing Guaranty, including as a  result of Purchaser's
failure to perform or pay and discharge all obligations under such Existing
Guaranty or arising from or related to Purchaser's actions after the Closing
under such Existing Guaranties (unless such obligations relate to a  matter
for which Purchaser is entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement). If
any such Existing Guaranty remains outstanding and not fully released after
the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company Group or
any of their  Affiliates to, (A) renew or extend the term of or (B) increase
the obligations under, or transfer to another Person, any liability for which
Seller or its Affiliates or direct and indirect equityholders (other than the
Company Group) is or would  reasonably be expected to be liable under any
such outstanding Existing Guaranty.

 

 

85  

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall  be under no obligation to extend or
renew any Existing Guaranty that expires by its terms, or to agree with any
beneficiary of an Existing Guaranty to any amendment, waiver, or assignment
thereof.

 

(c) Seller shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause the complete and
unconditional release of the Company Group from those guarantees, letters of
credit, surety bonds, indemnities and similar obligations with respect to the
Business set forth on Section 5.26(a) of the Seller  Disclosure Schedule
(each, an " _Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty_ "), and, if necessary, the
substitution of a similar obligation of Seller, an Affiliate of Seller (other
than a member of the Company Group) or a Third Party as the guarantor, 
indemnitor or responsible party (a " _Substitute Acquired Entity Guaranty_ ")
under each Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty, which Substitute Acquired Entity
Guaranties shall be effective upon the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing, if any  Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty remains outstanding and
not fully released after the Closing, Seller shall:

 

 

 

(i) continue to use reasonable best efforts after the  Closing to relieve and
release Purchaser, the Company Group, or its or their Affiliates or direct and
indirect equityholders of any liabilities under any Existing Acquired Entity
Guaranty under which Seller or one or more of its Affiliates have  not been
substituted in all respects for Purchaser, the Company Group, or its or their
Affiliates or direct and indirect equityholders as of the Closing Date;

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) not (A) renew or extend the term of or (B) increase  the obligations
under, or transfer to another Person, any liability for which Purchaser, the
Company Group, or its or their Subsidiaries or direct and indirect
equityholders is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under any such 
outstanding Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty; and

 

 

86  

 

 

 

 

(iii) indemnify and hold harmless, and compensate and  reimburse, Purchaser,
the Company Group, or its or their Affiliates or direct and indirect
equityholders with respect to all Liabilities arising out of or relating to
any such Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty, including any failure of Seller
to  perform, pay and discharge all obligations under such Existing Acquired
Entity Guaranty.

 

 

 

(d) Purchaser shall be under no  obligation to extend or renew any Existing
Acquired Entity Guaranty that expires by its terms, nor to agree with any
beneficiary of an Existing Acquired Entity Guaranty to any amendment, waiver,
or assignment thereof.

 

SECTION 5.27. _Insurance_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees  that, except as expressly provided in
this Section 5.27, effective at the time of the Closing, the Company Group
will cease to be insured by any Insurance Policies. Purchaser and the Company
Group or any of their respective Affiliates (but not  Seller or any of its
Affiliates) shall be solely responsible for procuring, paying for and
maintaining insurance coverage for the Company Group effective from and after
the Closing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.27(a),  with respect to acts, omissions, events
or circumstances allegedly or actually relating to the Company Group that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing that are covered by occurrence-based
Insurance Policies of Seller or any of its Affiliates  (other than the
Company Group) under which the Company, the Company Subsidiary or an insured
affiliated with or named by the Company or the Company Subsidiary is insured
prior to the Closing, Purchaser or the Company or the Company Subsidiary, or 
such insured as applicable, shall have the express right to make claims under
such occurrence-based Insurance Policies subject to the terms and conditions
thereof and this Agreement, to the extent such coverage and limits are
available; _provided_ ,  that Purchaser or such insured: (i) shall notify, or
cause the Company or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, to notify, Seller
in writing of all such covered claims; and (ii) shall exclusively bear, or
cause the Company or the Company  Subsidiary or such insured, as applicable,
to exclusively bear, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates or direct or
indirect equityholders shall have any obligation to repay or reimburse
Purchaser or the Company Group or such insured for, the  amount of any
deductibles or self-insured retentions associated with claims under such
Insurance Policies, and Purchaser or such insured shall be liable for all
uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts of such claims;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that any insurance proceeds related to losses
incurred by the Company Group prior to the Closing shall be paid to Seller
unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Seller shall reasonably
assist and cooperate with  Purchaser on any claim for coverage and the
receipt of insurance proceeds by or on behalf of the Company Group or
Purchaser. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall take no action to
exclude or remove the Company or the Company Subsidiary or  an insured
affiliated with or named by the Company or the Company Subsidiary from any
occurrence-based Insurance Policies that were in effect at any time prior to
the Closing.

 

 

87  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, from  and after the Closing, neither
Purchaser nor the Company Group shall have any right to, nor shall any of the
foregoing, make claims or seek coverage under any claims-made Insurance
Policies provided to the Company Group by Third Parties or by  Seller or any
of its Affiliates.

 

(d) Purchaser shall cause the Company  Group to reasonably cooperate with
Seller and share such information as is reasonably requested by Seller in
order to permit Seller and its Affiliates and direct and indirect
equityholders to manage and conduct their insurance matters as such  Persons
deem reasonably appropriate.

 

SECTION 5.28. _Shared Contracts_. Prior to the Closing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) seek all
Consents required under any Material Contract to which Purchaser has provided
written  notice to Seller that such Consent shall be sought, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) assign any Shared Contracts that
relate exclusively to the Business, to the Company Subsidiary and (c) cause
the Company Group to enter into  new Contracts with the counterparties to the
Shared Contracts which are primarily, but not exclusively, used in the
Business on terms which are in the aggregate no less favorable, in the case of
monetary terms, and not materially less favorable, in  the case of non-
monetary terms, to the Company Group those terms in the existing applicable
Shared Contract so that the Company Group shall be entitled to the rights and
benefits, and shall be responsible for any related economic burden, relating 
to the Business thereunder and Seller or its Affiliates shall be entitled to
the rights and benefits, and shall be responsible for any economic burden,
relating to the balance of the subject matter of such Shared Contract. Neither
Seller nor  Purchaser shall be obligated to make, and without the prior
written consent of Purchaser shall not cause or permit the Company Group to
make, or agree to make, any payment or concession to any Third Party in
connection with any such consent,  assignment or new Contract. If any Shared
Contract is not assigned or separated prior to the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to,
continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to  cause, for the
12-month period after the Closing or, if earlier, until such Shared Contract
is assigned, separated or expires in accordance with its terms, (i) the rights
and benefits under each Shared Contract to the extent relating to the 
Business to be enjoyed by the Company Group, (ii) the economic burden under
each Shared Contract to the extent relating to the Business to be borne by the
Company Group, (iii) the rights and benefits under each Shared Contract to the
extent  relating to the Business to be enjoyed by the Company Group, and (iv)
the economic burden under each Shared Contract to the extent relating to any
business other than the Business to be borne by Seller. Nothing in this
Section 5.28 shall require  Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates to make any payment, incur any obligation (other than those
expressly set forth in this Section 5.28) or grant any concession in order to
effect any transaction contemplated by this Section  5.28.

 

SECTION 5.29. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted  by Law, the Organizational Documents of
the Company Group shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors, managers and officers than are set forth  in the Organizational
Documents of the Company Group as of the date hereof, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights  thereunder
of any such individuals.

 

 

88  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller  shall obtain or otherwise secure "tail"
insurance policies to the officers' and directors' liability insurance
policies, to remain in effect for six years after the Closing with respect to
acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the  Closing in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable to such
policies as of the date hereof under Seller's existing applicable insurance
policies; _provided_ , that Seller may substitute therefor policies of at
least  the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date and  extend such coverage for at least six years
following the Closing Date.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein  to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing) is made against any Indemnified Individual on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Closing, the provisions of this  Section 5.29 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

 

(d) This covenant is intended to be  for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an  Indemnified Individual
is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(e) In the event that the Company  or Purchaser or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all  or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in 
this Section 5.29.

 

SECTION 5.30. _Transition Support Services Agreement Schedules_. On the
Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser (on behalf of themselves and their
respective applicable Affiliates) shall enter into the Transition Support
Services  Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_.
The Parties acknowledge that the schedules to the form of Transitional Support
Services Agreement (the " _TSSA Schedules_ ") have not been finalized in their
entirety and  agreed to by the Parties as of the date of this Agreement. The
Parties agree to work together in good faith using their reasonable best
efforts prior to the Closing to prepare and agree to the TSSA Schedules and
Seller shall not unreasonably  withhold, condition or delay approval of any
reasonable request by Purchaser to include a service on the TSSA Schedules
which has been provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the Company
Group as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 

SECTION 5.31. _Information Statement Filing_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably  practicable, and in any event within 60 days
following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Information Statement. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and after  consultation with Purchaser
and reasonably considering any reasonable proposals by Purchaser with respect
to Seller's response) to respond to any comments or requests for additional
information made by the SEC with respect to the Information  Statement.

 

 

89  

(b) As promptly as reasonably  practicable after the Information Statement
has been cleared by the SEC or as promptly as reasonably practicable after 10
days have passed since the date of filing of the preliminary Information
Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of  its intent to review
the Information Statement, Seller shall file with the SEC the Information
Statement in definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act substantially in the form previously cleared or filed with 
the SEC, as the case may be, and mail a copy of the Information Statement to
Seller's stockholders of record.

 

(c) Purchaser shall reasonably  cooperate with Seller in the preparation of
the Information Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) Purchaser will furnish to Seller the information relating to it and its
Affiliates required by the Exchange Act and the  rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Information Statement, that is
customarily included in information statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or that is 
reasonably requested by Seller, and (ii) prior to the filing with the SEC or
the mailing to the stockholders of Seller of the Information Statement, Seller
shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on, and Seller  shall reasonably consider all comments reasonably proposed by
Purchaser with respect to, the Information Statement. Each of Seller and
Purchaser agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Information Statement which shall have  become false or misleading. Seller
shall promptly (A) notify Purchaser upon the receipt of any comments or
requests from the SEC and its staff related to the Information Statement and
(B) provide Purchaser with copies of all correspondence between  Seller and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to the Information Statement.
No amendment or supplement to the  Information Statement shall be made by
Seller without providing the Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on, and Seller shall reasonably consider all comments reasonably
proposed by Purchaser with respect to, such  amendment.

 

SECTION 5.32. _Seller 365 Day Certificate_. No later than September 10, 2021
at 12:00 p.m. Central Time, if the Closing has not occurred prior to such
time, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate in the form attached
hereto  as _Exhibit H_ dated as of September 10, 2021 duly executed by an
authorized officer of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than with respect to Fraud,
failure of  any certification, representation, warranty or other statement in
the certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 5.32 to be true and correct
as of such date shall not constitute a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant under this  Agreement for any purpose. Time is of the essence
with respect to this Section 5.32.

 

 

90  

SECTION 5.33. _Transfer and Release of Collateral_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller  shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) transfer or cause to be transferred from the Company Group to Seller any
and all cash and cash equivalents which are held as collateral, pledged or
otherwise required to support the Pre-Closing DOE  Letter of Credit, such
that the Company Group shall have no further rights in such cash and cash
equivalents or obligations pursuant to the Company Subsidiary Deposit Account
Pledge Agreement (as defined in the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and  (ii)
transfer or cause to be transferred from Seller to the Company Group any and
all cash and cash equivalents which are held by Seller but collateralized,
pledged or otherwise required to support any other letters of credit,
performance bonds,  surety bonds or similar instruments required by any
Educational Agency for the benefit of, or with respect to, the Company Group
(such cash or cash equivalents, the " _Seller Regulatory Collateral_ "), in
each case to the extent permissible  pursuant to the terms of such
instruments.

 

(b) With respect to any Seller  Regulatory Collateral held by Seller at or
following the Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts from
and after the Closing to cause such Seller Regulatory Collateral to be
released from or otherwise become free of the Liens under  the applicable
letters of credit, performance bonds, surety bonds or similar instruments to
which such collateral relates to permit such Seller Regulatory Collateral to
be transferred by Seller without breach of or violation thereof or of any 
applicable Law or Educational Law. With respect to any Seller Regulatory
Collateral or portion thereof that remains Seller Regulatory Collateral as of
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (other than any DOE Restricted
Cash), Purchaser  shall, or shall cause the Company Group to, remit the
amount of such remaining Seller Regulatory Collateral or such portion thereof
to Seller within 30 days following the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date (any amounts so remitted to Seller,  the " _Seller Regulatory Collateral
Refund_ "). To the extent that any Seller Regulatory Collateral (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any DOE Restricted Cash) or portion thereof is
released following the payment by Purchaser or the  Company Group of any
Seller Regulatory Collateral Refund with respect thereto, Seller shall
promptly, and in any event within 30 days following such release in whole or
in part thereof, remit to Purchaser any such Seller Regulatory Collateral
with  respect to which Seller had received a Seller Regulatory Collateral
Refund.

 

(c) With respect to any DOE  Restricted Cash: (i) so long as such cash or
cash equivalents remain DOE Restricted Cash, such DOE Restricted Cash shall
not be transferred or pledged, other than pursuant to the Pre-Closing Letter
of Credit, the Company Subsidiary Deposit Account  Pledge Agreement or any
other related pledge agreement; (ii) Purchaser will request that the
depositary bank of such DOE Restricted Cash provide monthly statements of the
amount of such cash to Seller; (iii) promptly, and in any event within 30 
days following the date on which Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that the
Pre-Closing DOE Letter of Credit is terminated or released, or the DOE
Restricted Cash is otherwise released from the pledge or restrictions thereon,
including the  Company Subsidiary Deposit Account Pledge Agreement, in each
case, such that Purchaser may transfer such cash or cash equivalents to Seller
or its designee, in whole or in part, without breach or violation thereof or
of any Law or Educational Law,  Purchaser shall remit such released cash or
cash equivalents to Seller or Seller's designee. Purchaser shall have no right
to set-off, deduction, recoupment or offset regarding any DOE Restricted Cash
with respect to any payments owed,  obligations, disputes, claims or
Liabilities that Purchaser could assert against Seller, whether under this
Agreement or otherwise.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, with  respect to any Regulatory Restricted
Cash included in the calculation of Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents, from
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall not have any obligation to remit such
cash to the Seller pursuant to this Section 5.33 following  the release
thereof.

7.01(d)(i) if Seller is then in breach of any representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements hereunder which breach would result in a
condition to the Closing set forth in  Section 6.01, Section 6.02(a), Section
6.02(b) or Section 6.02(c) not being satisfied or (B) notwithstanding any cure
periods set forth in Section 7.01(d)(i), if all of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01, Section 6.02(a), Section 6.02(b)  and Section 6.02(c) have been
satisfied (other than any condition which by its nature is to be satisfied at
the Closing) and Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing by the time the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02; or

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section  6.01 and Section 6.02
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing itself, but subject to the
ability of such conditions to be satisfied at the Closing) if the Closing 
Date were the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02),
(B) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing within two Business Days
following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.02,
(C) Seller has  irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Purchaser that (1)
all conditions set forth in Section 6.01 (with respect to Seller) and Section
6.03 have been satisfied or that it will waive any unsatisfied conditions in
Section 6.01 (with respect to  Seller _)_ and Section 6.03 and (2) Seller is
ready, willing and able to and will consummate the Closing on such date and at
all times during the five Business Day period thereafter and (D) the Closing
shall not have been consummated by the  later of five Business Days after

Section 2.02, neither Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii).

SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event Seller or Purchaser elects
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ 7.01(b), (c) or (d), such
termination shall be effective only upon written notice thereof  delivered to
the other Party, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made; _provided_ , that in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section_ 7.01(c) or _Section_ 7.01(d)(i), such termination is  subject to
the prior delivery of the notice and cure period referenced therein, if
applicable. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no
further  force and effect (other than the provisions of _Section 5.03(a_ )
(Confidentiality), Section 5.09 (Publicity), this _Article_ VII and _Article_
X, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall
be no  Liability on the part of Purchaser or Seller or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, except, subject to Section 7.03, (a) as
Liability may exist pursuant to the sections specified in this Section 7.02
that survive such termination and  (b) that no such termination shall relieve
either Party from any Liability arising out of any Willful Breach by such
Party of any covenant or agreement of such Party contained in this Agreement
or Fraud. " _Willful Breach_ " means a knowing and  intentional deliberate
act or a deliberate failure to act, which act or failure to act constitutes in
and of itself a material breach of this Agreement, which material breach
constitutes, or is a consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to act  by
such party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take
such act would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement  is validly terminated:

 

 

 

(i) by Seller pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section  7.01(d)(ii) (or is
otherwise terminated when Seller was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(d)(ii)),

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) at a  time when (A) the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01(c) _(i)_ is the only condition in
_Article_ VI which remains unsatisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing itself, but  subject
to the ability of such conditions to be satisfied at the Closing), (B) the
DOE's written response to the DOE Preacquisition Application following the
completion of the DOE's comprehensive review has been received and (C)
Purchaser does  not have a right to terminate this Agreement under _Section
7.01(b)(i)_ , _Section 7.01(b)(iii)_ , or Section 7.01(c)(i), or

 

 

96  

 

 

 

 

(iii) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(c) _(ii)_   at a time when
Purchaser does not have a right to terminate this Agreement under _Section
7.01(b)(i)_ or Section 7.01(c)(i),

 

 

 

then Purchaser shall pay to Seller (or Seller's designee) a non-refundable
termination fee of $88,800,000 in cash by  wire transfer of immediately
available funds (the " _Termination Fee_ ") as promptly as practicable and in
any case within two Business Days following such termination.

 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that in  the event that Purchaser shall fail to
pay the Termination Fee when due, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued
by Seller or its Affiliates (including reasonable fees  and expenses of
counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit)
taken to collect payment of such amount, together with interest on such unpaid
amounts at four percent per annum, calculated on a daily basis from the date 
such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 7.03 shall be
deemed to affect their respective rights to specific performance under Section
10.13.

 

(c) In the event that Seller shall  receive full payment pursuant to Section
7.03(a), the receipt of the Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by Seller,
the Company Group or any of the Related Parties or  their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and  none of Seller, the Company Group or any of the Related Parties or their
respective Representatives shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Proceeding against Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources or their respective
Affiliates and  Representatives arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, any Fee Letter, the Ancillary Documents
or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters  forming the basis for such termination.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree  that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that any payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty but is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will  compensate Seller in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the  consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision and that, without these agreements,
the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

 

 

97  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to Section 7.03 and Seller's rights set forth in Section 10.13,
the Parties acknowledge that, in the circumstances where the Termination Fee
is paid to Seller pursuant to Section 7.03(a), the  reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Purchaser and its Affiliates under Section 5.15
and Seller's receipt of the Termination Fee and any other amounts pursuant to
Section 7.03(b) from Purchaser and Seller's right to seek specific 
performance of this Agreement by Purchaser prior to termination of this
Agreement, as provided for and subject to the limitations set forth in Section
10.13, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, the Company Group and
the Related  Parties and their respective Representatives, successors and
assigns against Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives for any Losses and Liabilities suffered as a
result of this Agreement, the Debt  Commitment Letter, any Fee Letter, the
Ancillary Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, any  statements or
representations made in connection with this agreement or under any theory of
liability related to any of the foregoing or otherwise, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and upon receipt by Seller of
such  amounts, none of Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources or their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall have any further Liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, any Fee Letter, the  Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
circumstances where this Agreement has been terminated by Seller pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(d)(ii) and Seller has  received full
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.03(a), none of Seller,
the Company Group or any Related Party or their respective Affiliates,
Representatives, successors and assigns will be entitled to monetary damages
in excess  of the amount of the Termination Fee (except for any
indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to Section 5.16 and any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 7.03(b)). In any other circumstance, the amount of
the Termination Fee shall not serve as a  cap or limitation on the amount of
any monetary damages to which Seller, the Company Group or any Related Party
of their respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns may be
entitled pursuant to or in connection with this  Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, any Fee Letter, the Ancillary Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the failure to
consummate any such transactions). In no event shall (i) Purchaser be required
to pay the  Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether paid by or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (ii) Seller, the Company Group
or the Related Parties be entitled to receive (or designate any other Persons
to receive) the  Termination Fee more than once, and while Seller may pursue
both a grant of specific performance to consummate the Closing in accordance
with Section 10.13 and the payment of the damages or Termination Fee under
Section 7.03(a), under no  circumstances shall Seller be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to consummate the
Closing and any payment of the Termination Fee. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall the Termination Fee be payable on  more than one occasion,
regardless of whether the termination fee is payable in respect of more than
one event giving rise to a right of termination.

Section  8.02 _(vi)_ , the Claim Notice must be given before the third
anniversary of the Closing. Any claim for indemnification under this _Article_
VIII must be asserted by a Claim Notice within the applicable survival period
contemplated by  this Section 8.01, and if such a Claim Notice is given
within such applicable period, the survival period for such representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement with respect to such claim shall
continue until the claim is fully resolved.

 

SECTION 8.02. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Post-Closing Indemnification  by Seller_. Subject to this _Article_
VIII, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company Group)
and each of Purchaser's and such  Affiliates' respective Representatives (the
" _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and compensate and reimburse
them for, any and all damages, claims, losses, costs, Liabilities, Judgments,
expenses or amounts paid in settlement,  including interest, fines,
penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, defense,
enforcement of this Agreement and remedial action (collectively, " _Losses_
"), asserted against, suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred  by such
Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of or relating to:

 

 

 

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or  warranty made by
Seller or the Company Group in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, other than (A) the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Taxes) (which are the subject of 
Section 8.02(a)(iv)), and (B) the certificate delivered pursuant to Section
5.32;

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) any failure of Seller to perform or any breach by  Seller of any
covenant or obligation of Seller in or pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) any Indemnified Taxes;

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation  or warranty set forth

(v) any Liabilities of Seller or its Affiliates to the  extent not arising
out of or relating to the Business or the Company Group; or

 

 

 

 

 

(vi) any matter described on Section 8.02(a)(vi) of the  Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 

 

99  

 

 

(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser_.    Subject to this _Article_ VIII, from
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and
each of their respective Representatives and Affiliates (the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and compensate  and reimburse them for, any
and all Losses asserted against, suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred by
such Seller Indemnitees arising out of or relating to:

 

 

 

(i) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any  representation or warranty made
by Purchaser in this Agreement or any certificate delivered to Seller pursuant
to this Agreement;

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) any failure of Purchaser to perform or any breach  by Purchaser of any

Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates; or

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) any amounts drawn by the DOE under a Pre-Closing  DOE Letter of Credit
on behalf of the Company Group.

 

 

 

 

 

(v) The term " _Losses_ " as used in this _Article _ VIII is not limited to
Third Party Claims, but includes Losses incurred or sustained by such
Indemnified Parties in the absence of Third Party Claims, and payments by an
Indemnified Party shall not be a condition precedent to recovery; _provided_
  that Losses shall not include punitive and special damages except to the
extent such Indemnified Party is actually liable to a Third Party for such
amounts in connection with a Third Party Claim and such amounts are otherwise
indemnifiable  pursuant to this _Article_ VIII.

 

 

 

SECTION 8.03. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If  any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice or written threat of the
commencement of any Proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a Third Party
or the imposition of any penalty or  assessment, for which indemnity may be
sought under Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.02(b) (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this
_Article_ VIII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly  (but no later than 30
days after receiving such notice or threat), and in any event prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section 8.01,
provide the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice 
of such Third Party Claim, stating, to the extent available and practicable,
reasonable detail thereof, including the nature, basis, the amount thereof (to
the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of  such Third Party Claim), the method of computation thereof
(to the extent known or estimated), any other remedy sought thereunder, any
relevant time constraints relating thereto, and, to the extent practicable,
any other material details pertaining  thereto, along with copies of the
relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for
indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
within such 30-day period will not relieve the Indemnifying Party  from its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and then only to
such extent) that such failure actually and materially prejudices the defense
of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will have 30 days from
receipt  of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to the
Indemnified Party whether it is assuming and controlling the defense, appeal
or settlement proceedings thereof with counsel of the Indemnifying Party's
choice, it being understood that  the Indemnifying Party will not be liable
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim, except to the extent provided in this
Section 8.03; _provided_ , _further_ , that an  Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume and control such defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings if (i) such Third Party Claim seeks non-monetary relief (except
where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or  claims
for monetary damages), (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks criminal or
regulatory enforcement penalties or involves an Educational Approval, (iii)
the Indemnifying Party fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
diligently, (iv)  such Third Party Claim seeks money damages reasonably
likely to be adjudicated in excess of the applicable cap set forth in Section
8.04, (v) the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded, based on the advice
of counsel, that the Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified Party have a
material conflict under applicable standards of professional conduct with
respect to such Third Party Claim or (vi) in the case of indemnification of a
Purchaser Indemnitee, any insurer or underwriter is  required or has elected
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim under the RandW Insurance
Policy. Any notice of an Indemnifying Party indicating that it is assuming and
controlling the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings with  respect to
any Third Party Claim shall be accompanied by a statement of the Indemnifying
Party, for informational purposes only, indicating whether the Indemnifying
Party currently believes that it will responsible and liable for all Losses
which  result from such Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.04 or has any grounds to contents its responsibility and
liability therefor.

 

 

100  

(b) So long as the Indemnifying Party  has assumed the defense, appeal or
settlement proceedings of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i)
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co‑counsel at the Indemnified
Party's sole cost and expense and participate in (but not  control) the
defense, appeal or settlement proceedings of the Third Party Claim; _provided_
, that in the event the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded, based on
the advice of counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified  Party
have a material conflict under applicable standards of professional conduct
with respect to such Third Party Claim, the reasonable and documented cost of
such one separate co-counsel (together with no more than one necessary local
counsel in  any applicable jurisdiction) shall be funded by the Indemnifying
Party as Losses hereunder, (ii) the Indemnified Party will not admit any
Liability, file any papers or consent to the entry of any Judgment or enter
into any settlement agreement,  compromise or discharge with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to file any papers or
consent to the entry of any Judgment or enter into  any settlement agreement,
compromise or discharge with respect to the Third Party Claim in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that
such papers, Judgment, settlement agreement, compromise or  discharge fully
releases the Indemnified Party from any Liability with respect to such Third
Party Claim and does not involve any admission of any wrongdoing by any
Indemnified Party and does not impose any obligation, restriction, injunctive
or  non-monetary relief on any Indemnified Party. Any such participation or
assumption shall not constitute a waiver by any Party of any attorney-client
privilege in connection with such Third Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party
does not have the  right or elects not to assume or fails to assume the
defense, appeal or settlement proceedings of a Third Party Claim within such
30-day period, then the Indemnified Party may employ counsel of its choice to
represent or defend it against any such  Third Party Claim, and the
attorney's fees and costs, in each case to the extent reasonable and
documented, incurred by the Indemnified Party for such counsel will be
included in the Losses. The Parties will also cooperate in any such defense, 
appeal or settlement proceedings, and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
assumed or controls the defense, appeal or settlement Proceedings with respect
to a Third Party  Claim, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or
any Judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent (such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 

(c) _Other Claims_.

 

 

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after an  Indemnified Party becomes
aware of any claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim that might result
in Losses for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article_ VIII (a " _Direct Claim_ "), and  in any event prior to
the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section 8.01,
the Indemnified Party shall provide written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the Indemnifying Party stating, to the extent available and  practicable,
reasonable detail thereof, including the nature, basis, the amount thereof (to
the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of such Direct Claim), the method of computation thereof (to
the  extent known or estimated) and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing such Direct Claim and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the  Indemnified Party to give such Claim Notice will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder,
except to the extent (and then only to such extent) that the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Following receipt of a Claim Notice from an  Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall have 45 days to make such investigation of the claim
as the Indemnifying Party reasonably deems necessary or desirable. For
purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party agrees to make 
available to the Indemnifying Party or its Representatives the information
relied on by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the claim and all other
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control that  the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests.

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Within such 45-day period, an Indemnifying Party  may object to any
claim set forth in such Claim Notice by delivering written notice to the
Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's objection (an " _Indemnification
Objection Notice_ "). Such Indemnification Objection Notice must  describe
the grounds for such objection in reasonable detail.

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) If an Indemnifying Party shall object in writing to  any claim or claims
by an Indemnified Party made in any Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall
have 30 days after its receipt of such objection to respond in a written
statement to such objection. If after such 30-day period there remains a 
dispute as to any claims, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall attempt in good faith for 20 days (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) thereafter to agree in writing upon the rights of the respective
Parties with  respect to each of such claims. If no such written agreement
can be reached after good faith negotiation, each of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party may take action to resolve the objection in
accordance with Section 10.08, Section  10.09, Section 10.10 and Section
10.11.

 

 

101  

 

 

SECTION 8.04. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement (subject, in each case, to Section
8.04(h)):

 

(a) no Indemnifying Party's aggregate  maximum Liability under this _Article_
VIII shall exceed the Base Consideration;

 

(b) no Indemnifying Party shall have  any Liability under Section 8.02(a)(i)
[Seller General Representations and Warranties other than Tax Representations]
or Section 8.02(b)(i) __ [Purchaser Representations  and Warranties], as
applicable, unless (i) with respect to any given claim or series of related
claims for Losses, such claim or series of related claims is in excess of
$50,000 (and then for the full amount of such Losses once the claim 
individually exceeds such amount) and (ii) the aggregate Liability for Losses
suffered by the Seller Indemnitees or the Purchaser Indemnitees, respectively,
thereunder exceeds an amount equal to $5,550,000, and then only to the extent
of such  excess;

 

(c) Seller shall not have any  Liability under Section 8.02(a)(i) [Seller
General Representations and Warranties other than Tax Representations] in
excess of $5,550,000;

 

(d) Seller shall not have any  Liability under (i) Section 8.02(a)(i) [Seller
General Representations and Warranties other than Tax Representations], (ii)
Section 8.02(a)(iv) [Seller Tax Representations  and Warranties] and (iii)
Section 8.02(a)(iii) [Indemnified Taxes] solely with respect to Indemnified
Taxes described in _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ of the definition of "Indemnified
Taxes",  in excess of $11,100,000 in the aggregate;

 

(e) Seller shall not have any  Liability under Section 8.02(a)(vi) in excess

item or amount taken into account in the final determination of the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 2.04; and

 

(h) the limitations set forth in (i)  this Section 8.04 shall not apply with
respect to any claims for Fraud and (ii) Section 8.04(b) _,_ Section 8.04(c),
and Section 8.04(d) shall not apply with respect to any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any Fundamental Representations.

 

 

102  

SECTION 8.05. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which  indemnification is provided under this
_Article _VIII or _Article_ IX shall be calculated net of any amounts actually
received (net of any premium increases or retroactive premium adjustments and
any costs and expenses incurred by the  Indemnified Party in connection with
such recovery) by the Indemnified Party (including under insurance policies
and the RandW Insurance Policy). The Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts  to seek recovery under
all insurance and indemnity, contribution or similar provisions covering such
Loss; _provided_ that no Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any obligation to (i)
institute any Proceeding to obtain any such insurance if such  Proceeding is
not deemed, in Purchaser's reasonable discretion, to be covered by such policy
or (ii) make any material expenditures to obtain such recovery unless the
Indemnifying Party has agreed to reimburse such expenditures.

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party recovers  an amount from a Third Party in respect
of Losses that are the subject of indemnification hereunder or after all or a
portion of such Losses have been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Article_ VIII, then the Indemnified Party  shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) (A) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses _plus_ (B) the amount received by
the Indemnified Party  in respect thereof over (ii) the full amount of the
Losses, including for any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses) expended by the Indemnified Party in pursuing
such recovery or defending any claims arising  therefrom. Upon making any
payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article_ VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party  may have against
any Third Party insurers and any Third Parties that do not have any material
ongoing relationship with Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Business, and the
Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party
upon  the reasonable written request of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) Each Party shall, and shall cause  its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss indemnifiable hereunder upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any Loss that are indemnifiable  hereunder. Neither Party shall
be entitled to any payment, adjustment or indemnification more than once with
respect to the same matter (it being understood, however, that the fact that
Losses may be recovered under more than one provision of this  Agreement
shall not prevent an Indemnified Party from recovering all Losses to which it
is entitled under any provision of this Agreement).

 

(d) For purposes of determining  whether there has been a breach of, or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or failure of any covenant or
agreement and calculating the amount of Loss with respect thereto, all
limitations or qualifications contained therein based on  materiality,
materiality threshold or Material Adverse Effect shall be disregarded. For the
avoidance of doubt, without limiting _Section 5.32_ or _Section
8.02(a)(i)(B),_ this _Section 8.05(d)_ applies to any certificate  delivered
hereunder.

 

SECTION 8.06. _Exclusivity_. Except for (a) a claim for Fraud, (b) the rights
of any Party to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief) or any remedies available to it under applicable Law in
the  event of a Party's failure to comply with its indemnification
obligations hereunder, (c) Seller's rights pursuant to Section 5.26(a) and
Purchaser's rights pursuant to Section 5.26(c), (d) the determination of the
Purchase Price (which shall be  resolved exclusively pursuant to Section
2.04) and (e) the remedies set forth in _Article_ IX, from and after the
Closing, each Party's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to or arising out of this  Agreement, the Company Group, the
Interests, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
negotiation of this Agreement and each Party's due diligence investigations
related to the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be  pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article_ VIII or _Article_ IX
and the remedies in Section 10.13 and, with respect to Purchaser, the RandW
Insurance Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing  shall in no way
limit the remedies available to any Person under the Ancillary Documents.

 

 

103  

SECTION 8.07. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. Purchaser and Seller agree
to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required as the result of
a  determination by a Taxing Authority (within the meaning of Section 1313 of
the Code and similar provisions under state, local or foreign Tax Law).

 

SECTION 8.08. _Claims Unaffected by Investigation or Waiver_. The right of an
Indemnified Party to indemnification or to assert or recover on any claim for
indemnification shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with 
respect to, or any knowledge capable of being acquired, at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing,
with respect to the accuracy of or compliance with, any of the
representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.09. _R andW Insurance Policy_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the denial of any claim made by any Purchaser Indemnitee under the RandW
Insurance Policy, in and of itself, shall not be construed as, or used as 
evidence that, such Purchaser Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification
under this _Article_ VIII. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist and cooperate with Purchaser in connection with any claim by
a Purchaser  Indemnitee under, or recovery by a Purchaser Indemnitee with
respect to, the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

SECTION 8.10. _Manner or Payment_. For as long as there are funds remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account available to cover the Purchaser Indemnitees'
indemnifiable Losses, any and all Losses payable by Seller will be paid in
cash  first out of the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and
in the event such Losses exceed, or are not paid or satisfied in full from the
funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall have the right,  subject to Section 8.04, to satisfy in full such
Losses by pursuing indemnification rights and recourse directly against
Seller.

 

SECTION 8.11. _Release of Escrow Funds_. Subject to the further terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this _Article_ VIII, on the date that
is one year and one day following the Closing Date, in accordance with the 
Escrow Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
promptly release to Seller any amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow
Account; _provided_ that in the event any Losses are then payable by Seller
under this _Article  _ VIII and have not yet been paid or an indemnification
claim arises under Section 8.02(a) and notice of such claim has been provided
to Seller pursuant to this _Article_ VIII prior to the date that is one year
and one day following the  date hereof, an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of such then payable Losses plus Purchaser's good faith estimate of
unsatisfied claims for Losses of Purchaser Indemnitees properly made on or
prior to such date shall be retained in the  Indemnity Escrow Account until
the applicable underlying claims are resolved in accordance with this
_Article_ VIII and the Escrow Agreement and shall then be applied or
distributed as provided for in the Escrow Agreement. The Parties shall  give
such notices and shall take such other action as is necessary under the Escrow
Agreement to cause the funds to be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account
to the applicable Person in accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

104  

SECTION 8.12. _Insurance_. If Seller, in its sole discretion, elects to obtain
insurance with respect to the matters described in Section 8.02(a)(vi) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, at sole 
expense and cost of Seller, in obtaining such insurance, including by agreeing
to become or causing the Company Group to become the beneficiary of such
insurance directly. Any amount recovered by Purchaser or its Affiliates under
any such  insurance policy shall be treated as an amount indemnified by
Seller for purposes of Section 8.04. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of Section 8.05 shall apply to any such insurance policy.

 

ARTICLE IX

timely pay in full all Taxes of the Company that are due and payable on or
before the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_.

 

 

 

(i) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall cause the Company  Group to prepare and

any Tax Return of the Company Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax  Period
due after the Closing Date and pay all Taxes due with respect thereto.

prior to the due date of such Tax Return, and Purchaser shall consider in good
faith any  reasonable comments by Seller that are submitted in writing prior
to the due date of such Tax Return. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Seller
or its Affiliates shall be responsible for any such Taxes except as provided
pursuant to _Article  VIII_.

 

 

105  

 

 

 

 

(ii) Seller and Purchaser shall make (or cause any of  their respective
Affiliates to make) any election available under Law to treat the Closing Date

made by Seller prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser
evidence of having made such elections.

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) In the case of any Straddle Tax Period, the amount  of any Taxes based
on or measured by income, sales, use, receipts, or similar items of the
Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of 
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the Company
Group for a Straddle Tax Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period by pro-rationing on a per diem basis.

relating to Taxes with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Tax
Periods. Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including
each  member of the Company Group) to, (i) properly retain and maintain such
records until such time as Seller agrees that such retention and maintenance
is no longer necessary and (ii) allow Seller, its Affiliates and Seller's and
its Affiliates'  respective Representatives, at times and dates mutually
acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
as Seller may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities
to be conducted during normal  business hours and at Seller's expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall permit
Purchaser to inspect or review or otherwise have any access to the Tax Returns
or any supporting information of the Consolidated  Tax Group of which Seller
is a member before the Closing.

 

SECTION 9.03. _Tax Withholding_. If any of the payments made by Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or its Representatives (including any payment agent and any escrow

under Law, Purchaser (or such other applicable withholding agent) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold the amount of such Taxes required to be
withheld from such payment (the " _Withheld Amount_ ") by Purchaser (or the
relevant Affiliate or  Representative) under Law and shall timely remit the
Withheld Amount to the proper Taxing Authority, and such payment to Seller
shall be reduced by the Withheld Amount. Any Withheld Amount shall for all
purposes of this Agreement be treated as  having been paid to Seller. If
Purchaser determines that any such withholding is required, Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Seller at least
five Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is  to be made,
with a written explanation substantiating the requirement to withhold;
_provided_ that no such notice is required with respect to United States

certificates  described in Section 2.02(d)(ii).

 

 

106  

SECTION 9.04. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Purchaser and Seller agree that,
for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code, the Purchase Price and any
Liabilities that are treated as assumed by Purchaser for U.S. federal income
tax purposes  shall be allocated among the assets of the Company Group as set
forth on Section 9.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Allocation_
"), as determined by Purchaser. The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any
adjustments to the  Purchase Price or the amount of assumed Liabilities under
this Agreement. Each of Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates
shall (i) prepare and file their respective Tax Returns (including IRS Form
8594) that are filed after the Closing  Date on a basis consistent with the

Section 1313 of the Code, (iii) notify the respective other Party of any
notice from any Taxing Authority disputing or reasonably expected to dispute
the Allocation and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to defend the 
Allocation in any Tax Proceeding, unless otherwise required as a result of a
change in Law after the date of this Agreement or a contrary determination
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

with respect to each relevant member of the Company Group on or prior to the 
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither Party nor any member of the
Company Group shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax Sharing
Agreement with respect to any member of the Company Group, and no payments
thereunder shall be  permitted to be made on or after the Closing Date with
respect to any member of the Company Group.

 

SECTION 9.06. _Purchaser   Tax Acts_. After the Closing, Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Company Group) shall not, without the prior written
consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed) take any of the actions  described on Section 9.06 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

 

SECTION 9.07. _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to any cash Tax refund
(including by way of credit received by the Company Group against any
liability for Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period in lieu of a
cash Tax refund)  of any Taxes of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are owed by the relevant Taxing Authority or actually received as
of the third anniversary of the Closing Date, net of any costs and expenses
relating thereto (including any  additional Tax imposed in connection
therewith). Purchaser will, at Seller's reasonable request and at Seller's
sole expense, cause the relevant entity to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any refund or credit to which Seller is  entitled.

(a) In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, references: (i)
to the Recitals, Articles, Sections, Exhibits,  Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule are to a Recital, Article or Section of, or
Exhibit or Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule to,
this Agreement; (ii) to any agreement (including this Agreement) or  contract
are to the agreement or contract as amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof ( _provided_
that this _clause (ii)_ shall not apply with respect to the Seller
Disclosure  Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule); (iii) to any Law
or Educational Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law or Educational Law as
amended from time to time and to any rules, regulations or guidance
promulgated thereunder, in each case,  as of such date; (iv) to any Person
include any successor, heir, executor or administrator, as applicable, to that
Person or permitted assigns of that Person; and (v) to this Agreement are to
this Agreement and the Exhibits, the Seller Disclosure  Schedule and the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule to it, taken as a whole. The table of contents
and headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and do not limit
or otherwise affect any of the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever the 
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the
words "herein" or "hereunder" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to refer to  this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific Section,
unless otherwise indicated. The terms herein defined in the singular shall
have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. "Extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" means  the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if." The masculine,
feminine and neuter genders used herein shall include each other gender. The
terms "dollars" and "$" means dollars of the United  States of America. The
word "or" is used in the inclusive sense (and/or). The terms "ordinary course"
or "ordinary course of business" means a Person's ordinary and usual course of
business, consistent with past practice, including (as  applicable) as to
frequency, timing, cost or other metrics. When calculating the period of time
before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step
taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in 
calculating such period shall be excluded.

 

 

111  

(b) When reference is made in this  Agreement to information that has been
"made available," "delivered" or "provided" to Purchaser, such information
shall have been (i) contained in the Data Room or (ii) delivered by hand
delivery or electronic mail to Purchaser by or on behalf of  Seller, in the
case of each _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , no later than 24 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement, or if less than 24 hours prior to such execution,
Purchaser shall have acknowledged receipt and acceptance thereof in  writing.

 

SECTION 10.07. _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that
the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Laws and public  policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any provision of this Agreement shall
be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid
or  unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the rights or
obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and
adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision shall be fully severable, (b)
this Agreement shall be  construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall not be affected by the illegal,  invalid or unenforceable provision
or by its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as
not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such  jurisdiction, it
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

SECTION 10.08. _Governing Law_. Subject to Section 10.14, this Agreement, and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, 
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into
this  Agreement), will be governed by, and enforced and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of
limitations, without regard to the conflict of Laws rules of such state that
would result in the  application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

SECTION 10.09. _Jurisdiction_. Subject to Section 10.14, each Party
irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding against it arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or disputes  relating hereto (whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise) shall (subject to Section 10.13) be brought
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, solely if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,  the United States District
Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, and the appellate
courts having jurisdiction thereover (collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "),
and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction and
venue of the Chosen Courts in personam with respect to any such Proceeding and
waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law any objection that it  may now
or hereafter have that any such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

 

 

112  

SECTION 10.10. _Service of Process_. Each Party consents to service of any
process, summons, notice or document that may be served in any Proceeding in
the Chosen Courts, which service may be made by certified or registered
mail,  postage prepaid, or as otherwise provided in Section 10.05, to such
Party's address set forth in Section 10.05.

 

SECTION 10.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR  IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER  PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER AND MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (C)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER  PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.11.

 

SECTION 10.12. _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to Section 10.14, this
Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled and any of the
terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be
waived only by  an instrument in writing signed by each of Seller and
Purchaser or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of the Party waiving
compliance. No course of dealing between the Parties shall be effective to
amend or waive any provision of this  Agreement. The waiver by a Party of any
right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by any other Party
shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other
breach or failure by such other Party whether of a  similar nature or
otherwise.

 

SECTION 10.13. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that  irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as  are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Closing and Seller's obligations pursuant to
Section 5.03 and Section 5.13) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach any provision of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge
and  agree that, subject to Section 10.13(b), (a) each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions  hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which it is entitled under this Agreement and (b) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither Seller nor
Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to  Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the
Parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that a Party seeking an  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.13 shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection  with any such order or
injunction.

 

 

113  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or  anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that Seller shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies to enforce
Purchaser's obligation to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement or to make payments required by Section 2.02(b) solely in the event
that each of the following conditions (which shall not apply to the right of
Seller to such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable  remedies
for any other reason) has been satisfied: (i) all conditions in Section 6.01
and Section 6.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing itself, but subject
to such  conditions being capable of being satisfied at the Closing if the
Closing were to occur at such time); (ii) Purchaser shall have failed to
consummate the Closing on the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant
to Section 2.02(a); (iii) the  Debt Financing (including any alternative
financing that has been obtained in accordance with Section 5.16(b)) has been
funded or would be available and funded at the Closing (or, if such Debt
Financing has been funded into escrow, such funds have  been or will be
released from escrow); and (iv) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Purchaser that all conditions in Section 6.01 (with respect to Seller) and
Section 6.03 have been satisfied or that Seller is waiving any such 
unsatisfied conditions for the purpose of consummating the Closing, and Seller
is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then Seller will take
such actions that are  within its control to cause the Closing to occur. In
no event shall Seller be entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific
performance directly against any Debt Financing Source. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller may pursue a grant of specific  performance as expressly
permitted by this Section 10.13 and the payment of the Termination Fee by
Purchaser, but under no circumstances shall Purchaser be obligated to both
specifically perform the terms of this Agreement to consummate the Closing 
and pay the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.03(a)_. If Seller
brings a Proceeding for specific performance pursuant to this Section 10.13
and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Purchaser breached this
Agreement  in connection with its failure to effect the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement, but such court declines to enforce specifically the
obligations of Purchaser to effect the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement, then, in addition to the  right of Seller to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Article_ VII, Seller shall be entitled to pursue all
applicable remedies at law, including seeking payment of the Termination Fee
in the case of a termination pursuant to Section  7.01(d)(i) or Section
7.01(d)(ii) or other damages, in the case of all other terminations hereunder,
as applicable, subject in all cases to the provisions and limitations set
forth in Section 7.03 and otherwise in this Agreement.

 

 

114  

SECTION 10.14. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties on behalf of itself and each of
its Affiliates hereby: (i) agrees that any Proceeding, whether in law or in 
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt
Financing Sources, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter)
entered into in connection  with the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New  York, so long as such
forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof and each Party
irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) agrees that any 
such Proceeding shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the application of the Laws of another state); (iii) agrees not to bring or
support or permit any  of its Affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way arising
out of or relating to, this Agreement,  the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter, any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in  the Borough
of Manhattan, New York, New York; (iv) agrees that service of process upon
such Party in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with Section 10.10; (v) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
that it  may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court; (vi) KNOWINGLY,
INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST OR INVOLVING
THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO, THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, ANY DEFINITIVE DEBT
FINANCING  AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY SERVICES THEREUNDER; (vii) agrees that none
of the Debt Financing Sources will have any Liability to Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates  or Representatives, any of their respective
current, former or future officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or partners
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt  Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter, any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder; (viii) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources are express third 
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions set forth in
Section 7.03, Section 10.01, Section 10.03, Section 10.13 and this Section
10.14; and (ix) Section 7.03 _,_ Section 10.01, Section 10.03, Section 10.13
and this  Section 10.14 (and any other provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment or waiver of such provision would modify the substance of
the foregoing) may not be amended or waived in a manner that is adverse to the
Debt Financing Sources  without the prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources and any purported amendment or waiver by any Party in a
manner that does not comply with this Section 10.14 will be void.

 

SECTION 10.15. _Joint Drafting_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as  if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship
of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.16. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of one Party to
the other Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied
or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such first Party, shall be deemed
to  have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such first Party.

 

 

115  

SECTION 10.17. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but
one  agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of
this Agreement by PDF or other electronic transmission shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.18. _Entire Agreement_. The Exhibits, the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule referenced in this Agreement
are a material part hereof and shall be treated as if fully incorporated into
the body  of this Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the other documents and
instruments specifically referred to herein, all Exhibits, the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser  Disclosure Schedule, contain the
entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this  Section 10.19 to the contrary, nothing
in this Section 10.19 shall bar, prevent or serve as a defense to claims for
Fraud (or any element thereof).

 

SECTION 10.20. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, all Proceedings, obligations, Liabilities or causes of action
(whether in Contract, in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute

117  

SECTION 10.21. _Seller Representative Privilege_. Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that the law firms listed on Section 10.21 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Seller Firms_ ") have represented Seller in
connection  with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that Seller, its Subsidiaries and
direct and indirect  equityholders, and their respective partners, officers,
directors, employees and representatives (the " _Seller Group Members_ ") have
a reasonable expectation that a Seller Firm will represent them in connection
with any claim involving any  Seller Group Member, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and
representatives (the " _Purchaser Group Members_ "), on the other hand,
arising under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the  transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser hereby, on behalf of itself and the Company
Group and the other Purchaser Group Members, irrevocably: (a) acknowledges and
agrees that any attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client privilege or
other  expectation of client confidence (" _Attorney-Client Privilege_ ")
arising from communications prior to the Closing between Seller or the Company
Group (including any one or more officers, directors, employees or
equityholders of the Company  Group), on the one hand, and a Seller Firm, on
the other hand solely to the extent related to the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby (such
communications, " _Privileged Deal Communications_ "), shall not pass to or be
claimed by or vested in the Company Group or the Business and shall instead be
deemed property of, and controlled solely by, Seller for the  benefit and on
behalf of the Seller Group Members; (b) acknowledge and agree that the Seller
Group Members shall have the right to retain any such Attorney-Client
Privilege solely with respect to the Privileged Deal Communications; (c) agree
that  no Purchaser Group Member shall have any right to waive any such
Attorney-Client Privilege solely with respect to the Privileged Deal
Communications; (d) disclaim the right to assert a waiver by any Seller Group
Member with regard to such  Attorney-Client Privilege solely with respect to
the Privileged Deal Communications solely due to the fact that any underlying
documentation or information is physically in the possession of the Company
Group or the Business after the Closing; (e)  agree to waive and not to
assert any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with Seller
Firm's representation after the Closing of any Seller Group Member in any
claim relating to a Purchaser Group Member or the transactions  contemplated
hereby due to Seller Firm's representation of Seller in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and (f) consents to the disclosure by
any Seller  Firm to any Seller Group Member (subject to the obligations and
restrictions, including with respect to confidentiality and non-use, set forth
in Section 5.03) of any Privileged Deal Communications. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, if any  claim arises after the Closing between any
Purchaser Group Member and a Person other than a Seller Group Member, such
Purchaser Group Member may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by a Seller  Firm to such Person,
and such Purchaser Group Member shall not waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Purchaser Group Member is required by judicial order or other legal  process
to make such disclosure, such Purchaser Group Member shall, to the extent
legally permitted, promptly notify Seller in writing of such requirement
(prior to making disclosure) and shall provide Seller with such cooperation
and assistance as  shall be necessary to enable Seller to seek to prevent
disclosure by reason of such attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client
privilege or other rights of confidentiality. This Section 10.21 is for the
benefit of the Seller Group Members and  such Persons are intended third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 10.21.
