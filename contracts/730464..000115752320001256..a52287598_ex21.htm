          respect to each disputed line item, such decision shall be made in strict accordance with the terms and definitions within this Agreement and the Accounting Principles and, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Purchaser,
          shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the Closing Statement or Seller in the Notice of Objection with respect to such disputed line item.&#160; Except as Seller and Purchaser may
          otherwise agree, all communications between Seller and Purchaser or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Expert, on the other hand, shall be in writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the
          non-communicating Party.&#160; None of Seller, Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Independent Expert regarding the subject matter hereof without the other Party&#8217;s prior written
          consent.&#160; The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final, binding and conclusive on, and enforceable by, the Parties (absent manifest error).&#160; All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne on a
          proportionate basis by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded in favor of each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party.&#160; By way of
          illustration, if Purchaser&#8217;s calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to Purchaser, and Seller&#8217;s calculations would have resulted in a $1,000,000 net payment to Seller and the Independent Expert&#8217;s final determination as
          adopted pursuant to this Section 2.04(b)(ii) results in an aggregate net payment of $500,000 to Seller, then Purchaser and Seller shall pay 75% and 25%, respectively, of such fees and expenses.</div>

        with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that Seller, its Subsidiaries and direct and indirect
        equityholders, and their respective partners, officers, directors, employees and representatives (the &#8220;<u>Seller Group Members</u>&#8221;) have a reasonable expectation that a Seller Firm will represent them in connection with any claim involving any
        Seller Group Member, on the one hand, and Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates and representatives (the &#8220;<u>Purchaser Group Members</u>&#8221;), on the other hand, arising under this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the
        transactions contemplated hereby.&#160; Purchaser hereby, on behalf of itself and the Company Group and the other Purchaser Group Members, irrevocably: (a)&#160;acknowledges and agrees that any attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client privilege or other
        expectation of client confidence (&#8220;<u>Attorney-Client Privilege</u>&#8221;) arising from communications prior to the Closing between Seller or the Company Group (including any one or more officers, directors, employees or equityholders of the Company
        Group), on the one hand, and a Seller Firm, on the other hand solely to the extent related to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions
        contemplated hereby (such communications, &#8220;<u>Privileged Deal Communications</u>&#8221;), shall not pass to or be claimed by or vested in the Company Group or the Business and shall instead be deemed property of, and controlled solely by, Seller for the
        benefit and on behalf of the Seller Group Members; (b) acknowledge and agree that the Seller Group Members shall have the right to retain any such Attorney-Client Privilege solely with respect to the Privileged Deal Communications; (c) agree that
        no Purchaser Group Member shall have any right to waive any such Attorney-Client Privilege solely with respect to the Privileged Deal Communications; (d) disclaim the right to assert a waiver by any Seller Group Member with regard to such
        Attorney-Client Privilege solely with respect to the Privileged Deal Communications solely due to the fact that any underlying documentation or information is physically in the possession of the Company Group or the Business after the Closing; (e)
        agree to waive and not to assert any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with Seller Firm&#8217;s representation after the Closing of any Seller Group Member in any claim relating to a Purchaser Group Member or the transactions
        contemplated hereby due to Seller Firm&#8217;s representation of Seller in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and (f) consents to the disclosure by any Seller
        Firm to any Seller Group Member (subject to the obligations and restrictions, including with respect to confidentiality and non-use, set forth in Section 5.03) of any Privileged Deal Communications.&#160; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any
        claim arises after the Closing between any Purchaser Group Member and a Person other than a Seller Group Member, such Purchaser Group Member may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by a Seller
        Firm to such Person, and such Purchaser Group Member shall not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that if such Purchaser Group Member is required by judicial order or other legal
        process to make such disclosure, such Purchaser Group Member shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Seller in writing of such requirement (prior to making disclosure) and shall provide Seller with such cooperation and assistance as
        shall be necessary to enable Seller to seek to prevent disclosure by reason of such attorney-client privilege, solicitor-client privilege or other rights of confidentiality.&#160; This Section 10.21 is for the benefit of the Seller Group Members and
        such Persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 10.21.</font></div>
