_soci ete anonyme_ organized and existing under the laws of France and with
registered offices at 21/23, rue des Ardennes, 75019 Paris, registered with
the Commercial Registry of Paris under number 429 600 158 (the "Company");



WHEREAS, certain Sellers have granted power of attorneys to ETMF II F Luxco

WHEREAS, Purchaser is a leading provider of open-standard software products

forth in this stock purchase agreement (the "Agreement").



Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the meanings
assigned to them in ARTICLE IX.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES



Section 1.1 _Sale and Transfer of Shares_



Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Seller agrees to
sell and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from each
Seller, the number of Shares specified opposite such Sellers name as set
forth on Exhibit 1.1, the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances, at the
Closing.



 

5 Section 1.2 _Purchase Price_



The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") to be paid by Purchaser
for the Shares shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Closing Amount as defined
in Section 1.3 below, and (ii) the Earn-Out Amount as defined in Section 1.6
below, to be allocated among the Sellers as set forth in Exhibit 1.2. With
respect only to any Selling Executive, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Closing Amount otherwise due to
said Selling Executive (the "Holdback Amount") if within eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date, such Selling Executive (i) has given notice of
his resignation from his employment with the Company, or (ii) has received
notice that he has been dismissed from his employment with the Company for
Faute Lourde (each, a "Retention Breach"), it being provided that in case of
a dispute between one of the Selling Executives and the Company or the
Purchaser with regard to the existence of Faute Lourde, the Purchase Price due
to such Selling Executive shall be reduced by the Holdback Amount only if the
existence of such Faute Lourde has been confirmed by a final and binding
decision of justice (" _d ecision de justice executoire_").



Section 1.3 _Closing Amount_



(a) The amount to be paid (subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 1.3
and 1.4 hereof), by Purchaser at the Closing (the "Closing Amount") shall
comprise the Initial Cash Payment as defined in Section 1.3(b) below, and the
Initial Stock Payment, as defined in Section 1.3(c) below.



(b) The Initial Cash Payment shall be a cash amount equal to:



 

(i) An amount (the "Cash Portion") notified by the Purchaser to the Sellers
Representative in writing no later than 18:00 hours in Paris on the fourth
Business Day before the Closing Date (which notice shall also state the number
of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (as defined below)), provided that this
amount shall be equal to or greater than forty million euros (40,000,000),
minus



(ii) An amount equal to the amount by which the total consideration paid or
accrued by the Company to acquire all of the equity interest in Musiwave Asia
Limited pursuant to the Musiwave Asia Agreements, exceeds one million three
hundred thousand euros (1,300,000), minus



(iii) An amount equal to the amount to be paid by the Company to Colin Gruia
before the Closing in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
including any costs incurred by the Company in relation to the foregoing; plus



(iv) An amount (the "Fractional Share Amount") (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (X) a fraction of a Purchaser share that
Sellers would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.3(c) below,
multiplied by (Y) the Purchaser Shares Price as defined in Section
1.3(c) below.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case where Purchaser shall have failed
to notify the Sellers Representative of the amount of the Cash Portion in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Cash Portion shall
be deemed to be forty million euros (40,000,000). 



 

6 (d) The Initial Stock Payment shall be equal to an amount of (i) one hundred
million euros (100,000,000), (ii) minus the Cash Portion, (iii) minus five
percent (5%) of the amount (if any) by which the Cash Portion exceeds forty
million euros (40,000,000). The Initial Stock Payment shall be paid in a
number of shares of Purchasers common stock, par value USD 0.001 (the
"Purchaser Common Stock") equal to the Initial Stock Payment divided by the
average of the closing price of Purchaser shares (the "Purchaser Shares
Price"), as reported on the NASDAQ website, over a period of twenty (20)
consecutive trading days, the last day included being the trading day five (5)
trading days prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that no
fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid, but in lieu
thereof the Fractional Share Amount pursuant to Section 1.3(b) above; provided
further however that a portion of the Initial Stock Payment (equal to the
Holdback Amount) which is payable to the Selling Executives shall not be paid
at Closing but shall be paid pursuant to Section 1.5.



(e) Sellers Representative may notify Purchaser at the latest five (5) days
before the Closing Date if Gilles Babinet and/or any of the Selling Executives
wishes to sell certain of the Shares he owns against a payment in cash only
(the "Option"), in which case, as an exception to the provisions contained in
this Article I, Purchaser shall pay those Shares (including the Earn-Out
Amount) fully in cash provided that the other Shares held by such Selling
Executive having exercised the Option will be sold against payment of an
amount in cash and in Purchaser Common Stock in such a proportion so that the
total amount in cash and in Purchaser Common Stock so received by the Selling
Executive having exercised the Option for the purchase of all of his Shares
be identical to the one he would have received should he not have exercised
the Option.



Section 1.4 _Payment of the Closing Amount_



At the Closing, Purchaser shall:



(i) pay to each of the Sellers (other than the Sellers listed in Exhibit 1.4
(the "Selling Executives")) an amount equal to the Initial Cash Payment due
to each of such Sellers as in the proportions set forth on Exhibit 1.2, minus
(x) the amount determined by multiplying ten million five hundred fifty six
thousand and four hundred euros (10,556,400) (the "Initial Escrow Amount")
plus the Escrow Amount Increase as defined in Section 7.1(c) (the Initial
Escrow Amount and the Escrow Amount Increase shall hereinafter be referred to
as the "Escrow Amount"), if any, by the number of Shares sold to Purchaser by
such Seller divided by the total number of Shares sold by the Sellers other
than the Selling Executives and minus (y) the amount of Jefferies Broadviews
and Weil, Gotshal and Manges fees due by such Seller as notified by Sellers
Representative to Purchaser no later than five (5) Business Days before the
Closing Date, in accordance with the instructions provided by Sellers
Representative to Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days before the
Closing Date;



(ii) pay to each of the Selling Executives an amount equal to the Initial
Cash Payment due to each of such Selling Executives as set forth on Exhibit
1.2 minus the amount of Jefferies Broadviews and Weil, Gotshal and Manges fees
due by such Seller as notified by Sellers Representative to Purchaser no
later than five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, in accordance with
the instructions provided by Sellers Representative to Purchaser at least
five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date;



 

7 (iii) deliver to the offices of the law firm of Weil, Gotshal and Manges, at
201 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood Shores, California, United States of
America, share certificates bearing the name of each of the Sellers,
representing one hundred percent (100%) of the Initial Stock Payment due to
each of the Sellers less the Holdback Amount;



(iv) deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account with Bank of the West
(the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and



(v) pay to Jefferies Broadview and Weil, Gotshal and Manges the amounts notified
to Purchaser by the Sellers Representative as stated above.



Section 1.5 _Payment of Holdback Amount_  



(a) If a Retention Breach with respect to a Selling Executive occurs within
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, the Purchase Price due to
such Selling Executive shall be reduced in accordance with Section 1.2 and
Purchaser shall be under no obligation to pay the Holdback Amount to
such Selling Executive.



(b) If, as of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, no Retention
Breach has occurred with respect to a Selling Executive, Purchaser shall pay
to this Selling Executive pursuant to Section 1.5(d) (i) forty percent (40%)
of such Selling Executives Holdback Amount, plus (ii) sixty percent (60%) of
the Holdback Amount minus



(X) an amount equal to any Purchaser Loss that has given rise to
indemnification by Sellers pursuant to ARTICLE VIII multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which shall be the number of Shares sold by such Sellling
Executive, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Shares
sold by Sellers; minus



(Y) an amount equal to all claims brought by Purchaser pursuant to ARTICLE
VIII which have not yet been finally resolved pursuant to ARTICLE VIII
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of Shares
sold by such Selling Executive, and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of Shares sold by Sellers (the "Holdback Reserve"); and minus 



(iii) any payments made pursuant to Sections 1.5(e), (f) or (g).



(c) With respect to the Holdback Reserve, Purchaser shall pay to each Selling
Executive pursuant to Section 1.5(d) the pro rata share of such Selling
Executives Holdback Reserve as the case may be, to the extent the claims
brought by Purchaser pursuant to ARTICLE VIII referred to in
Section 1.5(b)(Y) has been finally resolved in favor of the Sellers.



(d) Any payment of the Holdback Amount including the Holdback Reserve shall be
made in shares of Purchaser Common Stock by dividing the amount to be paid by
Purchaser to the Selling Executives by the average of the closing price
of Purchaser shares (the "Selling Executives Purchaser Shares Price"), as
reported on the NASDAQ website, over a period of twenty (20) consecutive
trading days, the last day included being the trading day five (5) trading
days prior to the day on which such payment shall be made, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be
paid but in lieu thereof an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the product of (i) a fraction of a Purchaser share that
Selling Executives would be entitled to receive pursuant this section,
multiplied by (ii) the Selling Executives Purchaser Shares Price.



 

8 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.5, if the stock
option grant that is required to be made to any Selling Executive pursuant to
the letters addressed by the Purchaser to the Selling Executives on the date
hereof is not made within four (4) months following the Closing Date and
except if a Retention Breach has occurred prior to such date, then one third
(1/3) of the Holdback Amount with regard to such Selling Executive shall be
paid to such Selling Executive pursuant to Section 1.5(d), and no such stock
option grant shall be required to be made to such Selling Executive.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.5, if the
employment of a Selling Executive is terminated for a reason which does not
constitute Faute Lourde, then two fifths (2/5) of such Selling Executives
Holdback Amount shall be paid to such Selling Executive pursuant to Section
1.5(d) upon such termination.



(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.5 and except
if a Retention Breach has occurred prior to such date, on August 15, 2006,
twenty seven (27) percent of each Selling Executives Holdback Amount shall be
paid to each Selling Executive. 



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a Selling Executive shall not
receive more than 100% of such Selling Executives Holdback Amount.



Section 1.6 _Earn-Out_



(a) The amount to be paid (subject to the terms and conditions of Sections
1.6(d), Section 1.7 and Section 1.9), by Purchaser on the Earn-Out Payment
Date (the "Earn-Out Amount") shall comprise the Earn-Out Cash Payment as
defined in Section 1.6(b) below, and the Earn-Out Stock Payment as defined in
Section 1.6(c) below.



(b) The Earn-Out Cash Payment shall be the cash amount (the "Earn-Out Cash
Portion") notified by the Purchaser to the Sellers Representative in writing

Earn-Out Payment Date, provided that this amount shall be equal to or greater
than forty percent (40%) of the Earn-Out Calculation Amount.



(c) The Earn-Out Stock Payment shall be equal to a number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (the "Earn-Out Stock Payment") determined by dividing
(x) the Earn-Out Calculation Amount, minus the Earn-Out Cash Portion and minus
five percent (5%) of the amount (if any) by which the Earn-Out Cash Portion
exceeds 40% (forty) percent of the Earn-Out Calculation Amount by (y) the
average of the closing price of Purchaser shares as reported on the NASDAQ
website, over a period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days, the last day
included in such period being the trading day five (5) trading days prior
to the Earn-Out Payment Date (the "Earn-Out Purchaser Shares Price").



(d) The Earn-Out Calculation Amount shall be equal to the sum of (i) the
EBITDA Amount as defined below and (ii) the Gross Profit Amount as defined
below:



(i) The EBITDA Amount shall be equal to:



(1) nine million euros (9,000,000) if Actual EBITDA is equal to or exceeds

9 (2) nine million euros (9,000,000) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be Actual EBITDA minus seven million four hundred forty thousand
euros (7,440,000) and the denominator of which shall be one million eight
hundred sixty thousand euros (1,860,000), if Actual EBITDA is equal to or
exceeds eighty percent (80%) of Budgeted EBITDA and is below Budgeted EBITDA;
or



(3) zero if Actual EBITDA is less than eighty percent (80%) of Budgeted

(ii) The Gross Profit Amount shall be equal to:



(1) six million euros (6,000,000) if Actual Gross Profit is equal to or

ninety-four thousand and four hundred euros (19,394,400) and the denominator
of which shall be four million eight hundred fourty-eight thousand and six
hundred euros (4,848,600), if Actual Gross Profit is equal to or

Each Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser Indemnified

and penalties recovered by a third party with respect thereto and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses and reasonable accountants fees and expenses
incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting,
preserving or enforcing any of the rights of Purchaser arising under ARTICLE
VIII) (the "Purchaser Losses") incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons that arise out of:



(a) any breach or violation by Sellers of any of Sellers representations and
warranties contained in ARTICLE III of this Agreement;



(b) any breach or violation by Sellers of any of Sellers covenants contained
in this Agreement, other than the covenants set forth in Sections 5.8, 5.10
and 5.11; and any breach or violation by a Seller of its covenants contained
in Sections 5.8,5.10 and 5.11.



Section 8.2 _Limitations_



(a) Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.9
and for breaches of the covenants contained in Section 5.1(a) and Section
5.1(e) through Section 5.1(r) shall survive until the end of an eighteen (18)
month period starting as of the Closing Date. No claim for the recovery of any
Purchaser Losses may be asserted by any Purchaser Indemnified Person after
the expiration of the applicable indemnification period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that claims asserted in writing by any Purchaser Indemnified
Person with reasonable specificity prior to the expiration of the applicable
indemnification period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of
the applicable indemnification period.



(b) Sellers indemnification obligations under Section 8.1(a) and Section
5.1(a) and Section 5.1(e) through Section 5.1(r) shall not be triggered unless
and until the aggregate amount of all Purchaser Losses exceeds four hundred
fifty thousand euros (450,000) at which point Sellers will be obligated to
indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Persons from and against all Purchaser Losses
for the aggregate amount thereof exceeding fifty thousand euros (50,000). In
no event shall the aggregate amount to be paid to Purchaser and/or any
Purchaser Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 8.1(a), Section 8.9 and for
breaches of the covenants contained in Section 5.1(a) and Section 5.1(e)
through Section 5.1(r) exceed the Escrow Amount plus, but only by way of set
off pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.9, the Earn-Out Amount, if any.



(c) The limitations set forth in Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b) shall not
apply to Purchaser Losses arising out of any breach of any representation
or warranty contained in Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8 (except for its
paragraph (b)), it being provided that in such case (i) Sellers
indemnification obligations shall survive until the end of a thirty six (36)
month period starting as of the Closing Date, (ii) that, for any breach of
the representations or warranties relating to the Shares, each Seller shall
only be liable for the Purchaser Losses in relation to the Shares it owns in
the share capital of the Company and (iii) that, in no event, shall the
aggregate amount to be paid by each Seller to Purchaser and/or Purchaser
Indemnified Persons in any case (taking into



 

48 account all claims made by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement) exceed the
part of the Purchase Price received by such Seller plus any fees incurred by
the Purchaser in claiming such Purchaser Loss.



Section 8.3 _Notice of Claim; Defense_



(a) Purchaser shall give Sellers Representative prompt notice of any third-
party claim (and in the case of any Tax audit within a ten (10) day period
from the date of receipt of any _avis de v erification_ or _proposition de
rectification_ ) that may give rise to any indemnification obligation under
this ARTICLE VIII, together with the estimated amount of such claim, and
Sellers Representative shall have the right to assume the defense (at
Sellers expense) of any such claim through counsel of Sellers
Representatives own choosing by so notifying Purchaser within thirty (30)
days of the first receipt by Sellers Representative of such notice from
Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser. Failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations hereunder (i) in the absence of actual and
material prejudice for the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) provided
that it does not affect the amount of indemnification due by the Sellers.
Sellers shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Company for any period during which Sellers Representative has not assumed
the defense of any such third-party claim (other than during any period in
which Purchaser will have failed to give notice of the third-party claim as
provided above) if such third party claim is covered by the Sellers
indemnification obligations under this Article VIII without regard to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.2(b). If Sellers Representative assumes
such defense, Purchaser shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by Sellers Representative. If Sellers Representative chooses to
defend or prosecute a third-party claim, Purchaser shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof, which cooperation shall include, to the
extent reasonably requested by Sellers Representative, the retention, and the
provision to Sellers Representative, of records and information reasonably
relevant to such third-party claim, and making employees of the Company
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any materials provided hereunder. If Sellers Representative
chooses to defend or prosecute any third-party claim, Purchaser shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such third-party claim that
Sellers Representative may recommend and that, by its terms, discharges
Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliates from the full amount of liability vis
a vis such third-party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the consent of
Purchaser, Sellers Representative shall not consent to, and Purchaser shall
not be required to agree to, the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief
affecting Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser; (ii) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving of a release from all liability with
respect to such claim by each claimant or plaintiff to each Purchaser
Indemnified Person that is the subject of such third-party claim; or (iii)
provides for monetary relief that is not indemnified under this ARTICLE VIII
by the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a claim may adversely
affect the Company, the Purchaser or their Affiliates other than as a result
of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to full indemnification
under this Agreement taking into account the limitations set forth in Section
8.2 and Section 8.9, the Purchaser may, by notice to the Sellers
Representative, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle
such claim, but the Sellers will not be bound by any determination of a claim
so defended or any comprise or settlement effected without its consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).



 

49 Section 8.4 _Calculation of Claim_



(a) Any indemnification due by Sellers shall be calculated taking into account
(i) the effect of any cash Tax savings realized by the Purchaser or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of and to the extent the
Purchaser Loss is deductible for purposes of calculating a Tax, and (ii) the
effect of any Tax cost borne by the Purchaser as a result of such Purchaser
Loss of indemnification payment or accrual therefore, so that the Purchaser
Group shall be in the same position as it would have been had the Purchaser
Loss and indemnification therefore not occurred.



(b) Any Tax which merely constitutes a timing difference over a period
of eighteen (18) months or less in the corresponding charge (reintegration of
depreciation, reintegration of provisions) will only be taken into account to
the extent of the costs of any penalties, late-payment interests or fines. If
an amount of value added tax is recoverable over a period of eighteen months
or less, a claim may only be made for the amount of the penalties and/or late
payment interest arising from a reassessment.



(c) The amount of any Purchaser Loss shall be calculated taking into account
only the specific reserve (if any) booked in the Financial Statements with
respect to such Purchaser Loss and in no event shall there be allowed an
offset of a Purchaser Loss against any general reserve or provision provided
for in the Financial Statements or otherwise; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
a Purchaser Loss which arises from or relates to payments due by the Company
or its Subsidiaries to one content supplier or one collecting society or one
holder of rights for the use of intellectual property rights relating to
a period prior to the Closing Date shall be allowed to be reduced to the
extent of any unused reserves provided for in the Financial Statements in
connection with possible liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
another content supplier, collecting society or holder of intellectual
property right for the use of intellectual property rights prior to the
Closing Date.



Section 8.5 _Recovery_



Without prejudice to Section 8.2, in the event that Sellers shall have paid to
purchaser an amount in respect of a Purchaser Loss and within twelve
(12) months of the making of such payment the Purchasers Group recovers all
or part of such Purchaser Loss from a third party (including insurance
proceeds), then Purchaser shall and shall procure that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, promptly, upon receipt of the sum so recovered from a
third party, repay to the Sellers an amount equal to the amount recovered by
Purchaser (net of any Tax, expenses or increased going-forward insurance
costs) and not exceeding the amount actually paid to the Purchaser in respect
of the corresponding Purchaser Loss.



Section 8.6 _Failure to Pay_



If any Seller fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement, and, in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser
makes a claim that results in a judgment against such Seller, such Seller
shall pay to Purchaser the reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of Purchaser in connection with such
suit.



 

50 Section 8.7 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_



All indemnity payments made by Sellers to Purchaser Indemnified Persons,
or by Purchaser Indemnified Persons to Sellers, pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the consideration paid
with respect to the Shares.



Section 8.8 _Effect of Investigation_



The right to indemnification, payment of Purchaser Losses or for other
remedies based on any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of
Sellers contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or the Closing
documents shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, it
being understood for the avoidance of doubt that to the extent such
inaccuracy or non-compliance has been fully and fairly disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE III then
there shall be no claim brought by Purchaser on account of such inaccuracy or
non-compliance. The waiver of any condition to the obligation of Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions, where such condition is based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to indemnification,
payment of Purchaser Losses, or other remedy based on such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation.



Section 8.9 _Specific Indemnification_



(a) _Obligation to Indemnify_



Each Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser
Indemnified Persons from and against and in respect of all Purchaser Losses
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons that arise out of:



(i) Any undisclosed liability (whether actual or contingent) of its
Subsidiaries or arising out of or related to the holding or the purchase of
shares by the Company in its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to any
liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries arising out of the Musiwave Asia
Agreements;



(ii) Any liability of the Company, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
relating to infringement or relating to the obligation to make payment for the
use of any intellectual property rights arising out of the use or distribution

sublicenses and others, of content including without limitation, ringtones,
ringback tones, full-length music, videos, titles, name of performers and
authors, disc covers, pictures and images, in the entire world;
notwithstanding any disclosure made pursuant to this Agreement including
without limitation the disclosures made pursuant to Section 3.23 and subject
to the right to offset reserves provided for in Section 8.4(b);



(iii) Any and all costs incurred by the Company, the Purchaser or any of
their Affiliates arising out of the transfer of intellectual property rights
from Gilles Babinet to the Company;



 

51 (iv) Any liability of the Company, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
relating to the settlement and release of any claim against the Company of
any Person that has made an offer for the acquisition of the shares of the
Company or the acquisition or the lease of substantially all of the Assets of

Section 8.10 _Limits on Contribution_



Sellers agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain payment of
any Purchaser Losses against the entire Escrow Amount, sixty percent (60%) of
the Holdback Amount, and, but only by way of set off pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.9, the entire Earn-Out Amount regardless of (i) the
pro rata contribution or share of each Seller to or in the Escrow Amount,
sixty percent (60%) of the Holdback Amount and the Earn-Out Amount and (ii)
the individual liability of each Seller for such Purchaser Loss; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall be required to apply for any Purchaser Loss
amount only prorata against the entire remaining Escrow Amount (after
reduction for payment received with respect to any previous claims) and the
remaining amount of sixty percent (60%) of the Holdback Amount (after
reduction for any Holdback reduction with respect to any previous claims and
any Purchase Price reduction arising as a result of a Retention Breach). By
way of illustration:



For the first Purchaser Loss, Purchaser shall be required to apply against the
Escrow Amount for 87.78% of the Purchaser Loss and shall reduce the Holdback
Amount for 12.22% of the Purchaser Loss.



If the Holdback Amount has been entirely consumed by Retention Breaches, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to apply against the Escrow Amount for 98.4% of
any Purchaser Loss.

Out Amount, Purchaser shall be entitled to obtain payment against each Seller
separately only, the Sellers acting neither jointly nor severally, subject to

Section 8.13 _Purchaser s Indemnification_



(a) The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Seller against and in respect of all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
settlements and expenses (including interest and penalties recovered by a
third party with respect thereto and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses
and reasonable accountants fees and expenses incurred in the investigation
or defense of any of the same or in asserting, preserving or enforcing any of
the rights of Sellers arising under ARTICLE VIII, and including any Tax
liability incurred by the Sellers in connection with the receipt of any
amounts paid under ARTICLE VIII) (the "Sellers Losses") that arise out of any
breach or violation by Purchaser of any of Purchasers representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.



(b) Purchasers indemnification obligations under Section 8.13 shall survive
until the end of an eighteen (18) month period starting as of the Closing
Date; except for Purchasers obligation under Section 1.8 which shall survive
until the end of an eighteen (18) month period starting as of the Earn-Out

by any Seller after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that claims asserted in writing by any Seller with

indemnification period shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the

thousand euros (450,000) at which point Purchaser will be obligated to

representation or warranty hereunder exceed the sum of the Escrow Amount plus
