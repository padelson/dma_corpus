notice to the other prior to Closing, exceeds $4,000,000, then such Party
shall provide written notice to the other of such determination together with

reductions and liabilities supporting such determination. Notwithstanding

such supplement or amendment and the Closing shall be extended as required to
allow MLP to do so; provided, however, if MLP reasonably determines that any
individual new disclosure item set forth in any such supplement or amendment
would increase the amount of the Assumed Obligations by more than $50,000,

calculations of such increase in the amount of the Assumed Obligations.
Promptly upon HOLDINGS receipt of such written notice, the Parties shall

Schedules. If within fifteen (15) days of HOLDINGS receipt of such written
notice, the Parties have not agreed to a value to be paid by HOLDINGS to MLP
therefore or another mutually agreeable remedy, MLP shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement at any time during the five (5) Business Days
following the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period by provision of
written notice to HOLDINGS. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if the

would have existed if such supplement or amendment had not been made.

32 ##### Table of Contents

circumstances exceeds $100,000 (" _Qualified Claims_ ");

(iv) under _Section 10.2(a)_, none of the MLP Indemnitees shall be entitled

prior to Closing. Unless HOLDINGS or a Third Person shall have made a claim or
demand or it appears reasonably likely that such a claim or demand will be
made, MLP shall not take any voluntary action that is intended by MLP to cause
a Claim to be initiated that would be subject to indemnification by HOLDINGS.

 



33 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) All Losses indemnified hereunder shall be determined net of any (i) Third
Person Awards, (ii) Tax Benefits, and (iii) amount which specifically pertains
to such Loss and is reflected in the calculations of the amounts set forth on
the Final Settlement Statement.

 

10.4 _Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend_.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification hereunder shall be subject to the
provisions of this _Section 10.4_. Any Person claiming indemnification
hereunder is referred to herein as the "Indemnified Party" or "Indemnitee" and
any person against whom such claims are asserted hereunder is referred to
herein as the "Indemnifying Party" or "Indemnitor."

(b) If any Claim is asserted against or any Loss is sought to be collected
from an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall with reasonable
promptness provide to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The failure to
give any such Claim Notice shall not otherwise affect the rights of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnified Party
has proceeded to contest, defend or settle such Claim or remedy such a Loss
with respect to which it has failed to give a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party, but only to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.
Additionally, to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby, the
failure to provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from liability for such Claims and Losses that it may have
to the Indemnified Party, but only to the extent the liability for such Claims
or Losses is directly attributable to such failure to provide the Claim
Notice.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the personal
delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify
the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it disputes the liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the Claim or Loss, and in the
event of a dispute, such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in
_Section 11.9_8 hereof, (ii) in the case where Losses are asserted against or
sought to be collected from an Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party,
whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall at its own sole cost and expense
remedy such Losses or (iii) in the case where Claims are asserted against or
sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party, whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall at its own sole cost and expense defend
the Indemnified Party against such Claim; provided however, that any
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period
to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party (and
of which it shall have given notice and opportunity to comment to the
Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to contest and defend any such Claim described in _Section
10.4(c)(iii)_ within the Notice Period, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and
shall be responsible for all costs incurred in connection therewith.

 



34 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) If the Indemnifying Party is obligated to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party, and the Parties have a conflict of interest with
respect to any such Claim, then the Indemnified Party may, in its sole
discretion, separately and independently contest and defend such Claim, and
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect
thereto by the Indemnified Party and shall be responsible for all costs
incurred in connection therewith.

(f) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it shall defend the Indemnified Party against a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate
Proceedings, and with counsel of its own choosing (but reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party) and such Proceedings shall be promptly settled
(subject to obtaining a full and complete release of all Indemnified Parties)
or prosecuted by it to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified Party desires
to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement it may do
so at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnified Party joins in any such
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to determine all
action to be taken with respect thereto, as long as such action could not
create a liability to any of the Indemnified Parties, in which case, such
action would require the prior written consent of any Indemnified Party so
affected.

(g) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees
to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any
Claim and in making any counterclaim against the Third Person asserting the
Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person as long as such cooperation,
counterclaim or cross-complaint could not create a liability to any of the
Indemnified Parties.

(h) At any time after the commencement of defense by Indemnifying Party under
_Section 10.4(f)_ above of any Claim, the Indemnifying Party may request the
Indemnified Party to agree in writing to the abandonment of such contest or to
the payment or compromise by the Indemnifying Party of the asserted Claim,
but only if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to be solely liable for
such Claim; whereupon such action shall be taken unless the Indemnified Party
determines that the contest should be continued and notifies the Indemnifying
Party in writing within fifteen (15) days of such request from the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party determines that the contest
should be continued, the amount for which the Indemnifying Party
would otherwise be liable hereunder shall not exceed the amount which the
Indemnifying Party had agreed to pay to compromise such Claim; provided that,
the other Person to the contested Claim had agreed in writing to accept such
amount in payment or compromise of the Claim as of the time the Indemnifying
Party made its request therefor to the Indemnified Party, and further provided
that, under such proposed compromise, the Indemnified Party would be fully and
completely released from any further liability or obligation with respect to
the matters which are the subject of such contested Claim.

 10.5 _Materiality Conditions_. For purposes of determining whether an event
described in this ARTICLE X has occurred for which indemnification under this
ARTICLE X can be sought, any requirement in any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by HOLDINGS or MLP, as applicable, contained in this
Agreement that an event or fact be "material," "Material," meet a certain
minimum dollar threshold or have a "Material Adverse Effect" or a

 



35 ##### Table of Contents

  

 material adverse effect (each a " _Materiality Condition_ ") in order for
such event or fact to constitute a misrepresentation or breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement, such
Materiality Condition shall be disregarded and such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements shall be construed solely for purposes of
this ARTICLE X as if they did not contain such Materiality Conditions.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.5_, any claim for
indemnification under this ARTICLE X will be subject to _Section 10.3_.

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. AS BETWEEN THE MLP INDEMNITEES AND THE HOLDINGS
INDEMNITEES, AFTER CLOSING (A) THE EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS
AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO SAID AGREEMENT AND THE EVENTS
GIVING RISE THERETO, AND THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR THEREIN OR CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY (OTHER THAN THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND THE PRIOR
CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT) AND (B) NO PARTY HERETO NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE
SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ITS
AFFILIATES WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN OTHER THAN AS
IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AND
THE PRIOR CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT.

10.7 _Negligence and Strict Liability Waiver_. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING
THE SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AN
INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR CLAIM
GIVING RISE TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT OF THE SOLE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR VIOLATION OF ANY
LAW OF OR BY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

10.8  _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN
THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER HOLDINGS OR MLP BE LIABLE TO THE
OTHER, OR TO THE OTHERS INDEMNITEES, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES
OR LOSS OF PROFITS; PROVIDED THAT, IF ANY OF THE HOLDINGS INDEMNITEES OR MLP
INDEMNITEES IS HELD LIABLE TO A THIRD PERSON FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND THE
INDEMNITOR IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH HOLDINGS INDEMNITEES OR MLP
INDEMNITEES FOR THE MATTER THAT GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, THE INDEMNITOR
SHALL BE LIABLE FOR, AND OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE SUCH INDEMNITEES FOR SUCH
DAMAGES.

 

10.9 _Bold and/or Capitalized Letters_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE BOLD AND/OR
CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE CONSPICUOUS LEGENDS.

11.5 _Entire Agreement, No Amendment of Prior Contribution Agreement,
Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement, together with the Transaction
Documents and all certificates, documents, instruments and writings that are
delivered pursuant hereto and thereto contain the entire understanding of the
Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all

waiver by either Party of any one or more conditions or defaults by the other
in performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall operate or be
construed as a waiver of any future conditions or defaults, whether of a like

unless otherwise expressly provided.

reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of this Agreement.

11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

11.8 _Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_.

(a) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced in
accordance with, and interpreted under, the Laws of the State of Colorado,
without reference to conflicts of Laws principles. 

(b) _Negotiation_. In the event of any Arbitral Dispute, the Parties shall
promptly seek to resolve any such Arbitral Dispute by negotiations between
senior executives of the Parties who have authority to settle the Arbitral
Dispute. When a Party believes there is an Arbitral Dispute under this
Agreement that Party will give the other Party written notice of the Arbitral
Dispute. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, the receiving
Party shall submit to the other a written response. Both the notice and
response shall include (i) a statement of each Partys position and a summary
of the evidence and arguments supporting such position, and (ii) the name,

additional thirty (30) days, to investigate the Arbitral Dispute before
submitting a written response. The executives shall meet at a mutually
acceptable time and place within fifteen (15) days after the date of the
response and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange
relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Arbitral Dispute. If one
of the executives intends to be accompanied at a meeting by an attorney, the
other executive shall be given at least five (5) Business Days notice of such
intention and may also be accompanied by an attorney.

(c) _Failure to Resolve_. If the Arbitral Dispute has not been
resolved within sixty (60) days after the date of the response given pursuant
to _Section 11.8(b) _above, or such additional time, if any, that the Parties
mutually agree to in writing, or if the Party receiving such notice denies
the applicability of the provisions of _Section 11.8(b)_ or otherwise
refuses to participate under the provisions of _Section 11.8(b)_, either
Party may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions of 
_Section 11.8(d)_ below.

(d) _Arbitration_. Any Arbitral Disputes not settled pursuant to
the foregoing provisions shall be resolved through the use of binding
arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association (" _Arbitration Rules_ "), as supplemented to
the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the
Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) and in accordance
with the following provisions:

(i) If there is any inconsistency between this _Section 11.8(d)_ and the
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this _Section
11.8(d)_ will control the rights and obligations of the Parties.

via certified mail, on the other Party that the first Party elects to refer
the Arbitral Dispute to binding arbitration, along with the name of the
arbitrator appointed by the Party demanding arbitration and a statement of the
matter in controversy. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such demand
for arbitration, the receiving Party shall name its arbitrator. If the
receiving Party fails or refuses to name its arbitrator within such thirty
(30) day period, the second arbitrator shall be appointed, upon request of
the Party demanding arbitration, by the Chief U.S. District Court Judge for
the District of Colorado, or such other person designated by such judge. The
two arbitrators so selected shall within thirty (30) days after their

for the District of Colorado, or such other person designated by such judge to
select the third arbitrator as soon as possible. If the Judge declines to
appoint an arbitrator, appointment shall be made, upon application of either
Party, pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. If any arbitrator refuses or fails to fulfill his or
her duties hereunder, such arbitrator shall be replaced by the Party which
selected such arbitrator (or if such arbitrator was selected by another
Person, through the procedure which such arbitrator was selected) pursuant to
the foregoing provisions.

(iii) The hearing will be conducted in Denver, Colorado, no later than sixty
(60) days following the selection of the arbitrators or thirty (30) days after
all prehearing discovery has been completed, whichever is later, at which the
Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or
without counsel. The Parties and the arbitrators should proceed diligently and
in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible.

(iv) Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of
the arbitrators will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. Any
such decision may be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction and may be
enforced by any Party as a final judgment in such court.

 

(v) The arbitrators shall have no right or authority to grant or award
exemplary, punitive, remote, speculative, consequential, special or
incidental damages.

(vi) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as modified or supplemented by the
local rules of civil procedure for the U.S. District Court of Colorado, shall
apply in the arbitration. The Parties shall make their witnesses available in
a timely manner for discovery pursuant to such rules. If a Party fails
to comply with this discovery agreement within the time established by the
arbitrators, after resolving any discovery disputes, the arbitrators may take
such failure to comply into consideration in reaching their decision. All
discovery disputes shall be resolved by the arbitrators pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

arbitration award has been entered pursuant to this _Section 11.8(d)_.

this Agreement is initiated by either Party, the decision of the arbitrators
may include the award of court costs, fees and expenses of such arbitration
(including reasonable attorneys fees).

(f) _Choice of Forum_. If, despite the Parties agreement to submit any
Arbitral Disputes to binding arbitration, there are any court proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, such proceedings shall be brought and tried in, and the Parties hereby
consent to the jurisdiction of, the federal or state courts situated in the
City and County of Denver, State of Colorado.

 

(g) _Jury Waivers_. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A
TRIAL BY JURY.

 

(h) _Settlement Proceedings_. All aspects of any settlement proceedings,
including discovery, testimony and other evidence, negotiations and
communications pursuant to this _Section 11.8_, briefs and the award shall be
held confidential by each Party and the arbitrators, and shall be treated as
compromise and settlement negotiations for the purposes of the Federal and
State Rules of Evidence.

11.9 _Notices and Addresses_. Any notice, request, instruction, waiver or
other communication to be given hereunder by either Party shall be in writing
