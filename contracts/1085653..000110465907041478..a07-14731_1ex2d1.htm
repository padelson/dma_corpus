SECTION 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that

SECTION 2.4. _Surrender of Shares_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement
with a paying agent designated by Merger Sub and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as paying agent for the stockholders of the Company (and,
to the extent any Equity Incentive Consideration is not paid at the Effective
Time, shall appoint the same or such other agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent for the holders of Equity Incentives) in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to this Article II. Immediately prior to the Effective Time Parent
shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make
all payments pursuant to Section 2.4(b).  Such funds may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_  that (a) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly cause additional
funds to be deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (b) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which

        

are then publicly available). Any interest or income produced by, or profit
resulting from, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as Parent directs.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event within two business
days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of either (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to
the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares (less any required withholding Taxes) and such Certificate
or book-entry shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or be accompanied by all
documents required to evidence transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by, and in accordance with, this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and each
Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or Book Entry Shares representing
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Dissenting Shares) shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II.

  

(c) All payments with respect to cancelled Equity Incentives, to the extent
not made at the Effective Time, shall be made by the Surviving Corporation as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Equity Incentives on
the Equity Incentive Consideration payable in respect thereof.

  

(d) At any time following the date that is nine months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and, after
such funds have been delivered to the Surviving Corporation, such
holders shall

        

solely be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable (without interest) upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Merger Consideration. Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company nor the Paying Agent will be liable to any person in respect of
any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares represented thereby.

  

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for in, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in, this Article II.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Shares or Equity Incentives pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Equity
Incentives, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.

  

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this
Article II.

  

SECTION 2.5. _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares) shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

        

ARTICLE III.

standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where any such failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).  The Company
and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such

reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be materially
adverse to the business, financial condition or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
following, or any changes, effects, events, circumstances, occurrence or
state of facts resulting therefrom, shall be deemed in themselves, either

account in determining whether there has been or could or would be, a
Material Adverse Effect:  (i) economic, financial market, or geopolitical
conditions in general, (ii) general changes or developments in the industries
in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate, (iii) the announcement of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) any actions

operating performance target (provided that any change, effect, event,
circumstance, occurrence or state of facts that may have caused or
contributed to such failure or change shall not be excluded), or (viii) acts
of God, national or international hostilities, war (whether or not declared)
or terrorism, unless, in the case of clause (i), (ii), (v) or (viii) such

principles, other than those which have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect; it being understood that in no event will the provisions set forth in

actions, proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, other than any such suit, claim, action, proceeding,

other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any other corporation or other trade or business

(ii) as of the date hereof, all Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries
required to have been paid have been paid on or before the due date for
payment thereof (except to the extent such Taxes are being contested in good
faith), (iii) the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries did not,
as of the date of the most recent financial statements included in the SEC
Reports, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance sheet included in

actions, suits, proceedings, investigations, claims or audits in

        

progress or pending with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, (v) there are no liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there is not in force any extension of
time with respect to the due date for the filing of any Tax Return by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any waiver or agreement for any
extension of time for the assessment or payment of any Tax by the Company or

either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a

treatment under Section 355 of the Code. No deductions for compensation paid
or accrued by the Company up to the date of the Effective Time are subject to
limitation under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any

not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

subsidiaries has been required to make, nor has there been proposed in
writing by the Internal Revenue Service, any adjustment pursuant to Section
481 of the Code that would be required to be reflected on any Tax Returns of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing
Date. No Subsidiary of the Company that is incorporated in a non-U.S.
jurisdiction has, or at any time has had, an investment in "United States
property" within the meaning of Section 956(c) of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has participated in any "listed

be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended

first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will, at the time

requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no

the Company that, except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood and agreed that
any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent

being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually or
in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent,
directly or indirectly, owns beneficially and of record all of the
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights,

or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such notice, consent, conflict, violation,
breach, default, acceleration, loss, right or other occurrence which would
not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

data and information as Parent, through its officers, employees or authorized

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
employees of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to
result in the breach of the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its
subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4 or otherwise shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

(collectively, and with such meaning where such term is used elsewhere in
this Article VI, " _representatives_ ") to, from the date hereof until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1, not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, or knowingly induce, facilitate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information or providing access to its properties,
books, records or personnel) any inquiries regarding, or the making,
submission or announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly take
any other action to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (other than with Parent and its representatives).
The Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
(including any such activities, discussions or negotiations conducted by
affiliates or representatives of the Company or any of its subsidiaries) with
any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will exercise any rights under any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with any such third parties to
require the return or destruction of non-public information provided prior to
the date of this Agreement by the Company, its subsidiaries or their agents
and representatives to any such third parties, except to the extent the Board
determines, following the date hereof and after consultation with outside
counsel, that doing so could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 48 hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with notice of such

inquiry. The Company agrees that it shall promptly provide Parent with oral
and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably
necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material respects of the
status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry (including any negotiations contemplated by Section 6.5(c)).

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.5(a),
prior to the Company Requisite Vote, if in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal by a third party, the Board determines in
good faith (i) after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, the
Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal, (x) furnish
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company
and its subsidiaries to the person who has made such Acquisition Proposal,
pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable
to such person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
including in respect to any standstill provisions and (y) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal
or offer from any person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)

        

of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its affiliates) relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or an equity interest representing
a 10% or greater economic or voting interest in the Company, any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 10% or more of the Shares then outstanding, and any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
a " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by a person other than the Company (with all percentages in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 50%) that is on terms that
the Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation),
taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the offer and the third party making the offer, to be more
favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)
than the transactions contemplated hereby and is reasonably capable of being
consummated.

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5, neither the Board nor any
committee thereof shall: (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Board of the Merger or
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to the Stockholders Meeting and subject to (if
applicable) the provisions of Section 6.5(e), the Board may modify, amend or
withdraw such recommendation if the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so could reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law
(regardless of whether an Acquisition Proposal has been made at any time);
(ii) recommend, approve or adopt, or propose publicly to recommend, approve
or adopt, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
(iii) allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter
of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding
(other than a customary confidentiality agreement) (A) constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to result
in, any Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; or (iv) effect any transaction contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be prohibited
from terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, if prior to
the Company Requisite Vote the Company has received a Superior Proposal that
has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Board may (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement (and concurrently
with or after such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter
into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal); _provided_ ,
_that_ the Board has concluded, in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this
Agreement, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board may not effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board shall have first provided
72 hours prior written notice to Parent (an " _Adverse_

        

 _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") that it is prepared to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, which notice shall contain the details of the facts
and conclusions that led the Board to conclude that the failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law (it being
understood and agreed that any material change to such facts and conclusions
shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Change Notice and a new 48 hour
notice period). In making a determination to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Board shall have taken into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation
Notice or otherwise). No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the
approval of the Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute
or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making
or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Board, after consultation with outside counsel, such disclosure is
required to fulfill the Boards fiduciary duties or is otherwise required
under applicable law.

ending on the first anniversary thereof (or if earlier, the date of the
Company Employees termination of employment with Parent and its affiliates),
to maintain for any Company Employee (i) subject to paragraph (a) above,
compensation levels (such term to include only salary, cash, bonus
opportunities and commissions) that in the aggregate are substantially
comparable to the Company Employee than, and (ii) **** benefits provided under
material Company Plans providing welfare and retirement benefits that in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to the Company Employee, and are
provided on terms that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the
Company Employee, as the overall compensation levels and benefits (and the

immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall maintain the Companys bonus plan throughout the term of the Companys
2007 fiscal year.

after the Effective Time by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (each, a "
_New Plan_ ") for the Company Employees service with the Company, its
subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by
the Company and the applicable Company Plan or Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  With respect to each New Plan that is a "welfare benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries
shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility exclusions or limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining
any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred
and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time or immediately prior to the date the New Plan is
later made available to Company Employees.

respective parties to this agreement and nothing in this Section 6.6, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal representative
or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in
this Section 6.6, expressed or implied, shall be construed to limit the
ability of the sponsor of any Company Plan, after the Effective Time, to
amend or terminate any Company Plan in accordance with its terms.

  

(e) No fewer than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company

person is not entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Companys certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, with a claims period of six years from the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope and on terms, in the
aggregate, at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys
current policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay more than 250% of the current premium to
purchase such policy, or (ii) maintain at no expense to the beneficiaries, in

beneficiaries thereof as those of such policy in effect on the date of the
Agreement) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor
and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company

suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

        

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not

liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto, except with respect
to Sections 6.4(b), 6.9, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, which

breach hereof.

  

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

        

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(i), and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or

at the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof (in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(f)) an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made or communicated to the Company or shall have been
publicly announced or publicly made known to the stockholders of the Company
