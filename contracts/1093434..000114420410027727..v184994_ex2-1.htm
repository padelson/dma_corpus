(a) (1) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) a payoff letter in a form satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser, pursuant
to which the Agent (as defined in the BTMUCC Credit Facility) have agreed to

SECTION 2.04. Adjustments to Aggregate Consideration.

 

 

(a) Estimated Aggregate Consideration - Pre-Closing. No later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
proposed statement based on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of
Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing (without giving effect to the
consummation of the Closing) (the "Estimated Balance Sheet") which sets
forth the proposed calculations of (i) the estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment"), (ii) the
estimated Closing Date Funded Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness"), (iii) the estimated Special Adjustment (the "Estimated
Special Adjustment"), (iv) the estimated Deferred Revenue Adjustment (the
"Estimated Deferred Revenue Adjustment"), (v) the estimated amount of Cash
that is unrestricted at Closing, such that it is available for distribution
to Seller at Closing (the "Estimated Unrestricted Cash Adjustment") and (vi)
the Estimated Aggregate Consideration based on such amounts (the Estimated
Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations set forth in items (i) through
(vi) above collectively, the "Estimated Closing Statements"). The Estimated
Closing Statements shall (A) include reasonable supporting documentation for
the estimates and calculations contained therein, (B) be calculated as of
12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date (the "Determination
Time"), and (C) be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 

 

(b) Post-Closing Adjustments.

 

 

(i) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall in good faith prepare or cause to
be prepared, and deliver to Seller, a proposed statement based on the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of the Determination Time
(without giving effect to the consummation of the Closing) (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") which sets forth Purchaser's proposed calculations of (i)
the Cash, (ii) the Net Working Capital Adjustment, (iii) the Closing Date
Funded Indebtedness, (iv) the Special Adjustment, (v) the Deferred Revenue
Adjustment and (vi) the Aggregate Consideration based on such amounts (the
proposed Closing Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations set forth in
items (i) through (vi) above collectively, the "Closing Statements"). The
Closing Statements shall (A) include reasonable supporting documentation
for the estimates and calculations contained therein (together with any
additional information reasonably requested by Seller), (B) be calculated as
of the Determination Time, and (C) be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. Purchaser shall deliver the Closing Statements to
Seller not later than 60 days after the Closing Date. Seller will
give Purchaser reasonable access to any records in Seller's possession
requested by Purchaser in order to prepare the Closing Statements.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Purchaser will give Seller reasonable access to any computations and
workpapers used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statements.
If Purchaser employs a firm of independent accountants in connection with
the preparation of the Closing Statements, Purchaser shall cause such
independent accountants to give reasonable access to Seller to any
computations and workpapers used in the preparation of the Closing Statements
subject, in the case of accountants' workpapers, to execution of a customary
confidentiality agreement by Seller if required by such
independent accountants. Purchaser will also give Seller and its
representatives access, during the normal business hours of the Companies, to
all personnel, books and records of the Companies as reasonably requested by
Seller to assist it in the preparation of Seller's Dispute Notice (as
defined below). Seller and its representatives shall be permitted to
ask questions of and receive answers from Purchaser and the Companies and
request such other books and records of the Companies as is reasonably
requested by Seller to assist it in the review of the Closing Statements.
Seller will deliver to Purchaser a written notice duly executed by an officer
of Seller (the "Seller's Dispute Notice") within 20 days after receiving the
Closing Statements if Seller believes that Purchaser's calculation of the
Cash, the Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, the Special Adjustment, the Deferred Revenue Adjustment, or the
Aggregate Consideration (A) has not been prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles or this Section 2.04 or (B) is not mathematically
correct, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all disputed
items, the basis for such disagreement, the dollar amounts involved (the
"Disputed Items") and Seller's calculation of the Cash, the Net Working
Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, the Special
Adjustment, the Deferred Revenue Adjustment or the Aggregate Consideration,
as the case may be. Seller will give Purchaser reasonable access to any
computations and workpapers used by Seller or its accountants in connection
with the review of the Closing Statement or the preparation of Seller's
Dispute Notice, subject, in the case of accountants' workpapers, to execution
of a customary access agreement by Purchaser if required by such accountants.
Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to ask questions of and
receive answers from Seller and request such other books and records of
Seller relating to Seller as is reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist
it in the review of Seller's Dispute Notice. If Seller's Dispute Notice is
not received by Purchaser within such 20-day period, the Closing Statements
shall be deemed to have been accepted and approved by Seller and shall
thereafter be final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser for purposes of any
post-Closing adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.04. In addition, to the
extent any portion of the Closing Statements shall not be expressly objected
to in Seller's Dispute Notice, such portion(s) shall be deemed to have been
accepted and approved by Seller and Purchaser and shall be final and binding
upon Seller and Purchaser for purposes of any post-Closing adjustment
pursuant to this Section 2.04. If Seller timely delivers a Seller's Dispute
Notice within such 20-day period, then the Disputed Items shall not
thereafter be final and binding until resolved in accordance with Section
2.04(c). The "Final Statement" shall mean the calculation of the Aggregate
Consideration using the Closing Statements, provided that, if any of such
Closing Statements are objected to by Seller, the final determination of such
Closing Statements pursuant to Section 2.04(c) shall be used in the
Final Statement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Resolution of Disputes. Upon receipt by Purchaser of Seller's
Dispute Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
the Disputed Items. If the Parties reach an agreement with respect to
the Disputed Items, such agreement shall be confirmed in writing and shall
revise the applicable Closing Statements to reflect such agreement, which
agreement shall thereafter be final and binding upon Seller and Purchaser for
purposes of any post-Closing adjustment pursuant to Section 2.04(d) (and any
amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.04(d) shall thereupon be paid). To
the extent Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree with respect to Disputed
Items within 20 days after receipt by Purchaser of Seller's Dispute Notice,
Purchaser and Seller shall promptly select a mutually acceptable accounting
firm (the "Selected Firm") with no material relationship to Purchaser or
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates and submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to such accounting firm for a binding resolution. If, within
three days after such 20-day period, Purchaser and Seller are not able to
agree upon any Selected Firm, the Selected Firm shall be the New York City
office of BDO Seidman, LLP. The fees and expenses of the Selected Firm shall
be allocated between Purchaser and Seller in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of such remaining Disputed Items so submitted to the
Selected Firm by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the Selected Firm)
bears to the total amount of such remaining Disputed Items so submitted.
Seller and Purchaser shall instruct the Selected Firm to render its decision
resolving the Disputed Items within 30 days after its engagement. Purchaser
and Seller agree that the determination of the Selected Firm shall be final
and binding upon the Parties absent manifest error and that judgment may be
entered upon the determination of the Selected Firm in any court having
jurisdiction over the Party or Parties against which such determination is to
be enforced. The Selected Firm shall determine, based solely
on presentations by Purchaser and Seller and their respective
representatives, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
specifically set forth on Seller's Dispute Notice and shall prepare a written
report as to the dispute and the resulting calculation of the Cash, the Net
Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, the Special
Adjustment, the Deferred Revenue Adjustment or the Aggregate Consideration
which shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent manifest error,
and the Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to
reflect such determination. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Selected
Firm: (A) shall be bound by the Accounting Principles and the definitions of
Cash, Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, the
Special Adjustment, the Deferred Revenue Adjustment and Aggregate
Consideration, (B) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in Seller's Dispute Notice, and (C) shall further limit its review solely to
whether Purchaser's Closing Statement is mathematically accurate and has been
prepared in accordance with this Section 2.04 (including the Accounting
Principles). The determination of the Selected Firm for any Disputed Item
cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the greatest or lowest
value, respectively, claimed for that particular item in Purchaser's Closing
Statement or in Seller's Dispute Notice.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Post-Closing Adjustment Payment.

 

 

(i) If the Aggregate Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement is
greater than the Estimated Aggregate Consideration, Purchaser shall, within
ten Business Days after the Aggregate Consideration becomes final and binding
on the Parties (as set forth on the Final Statement), pay the amount of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller, and Seller and Purchaser shall deliver,
within one Business Day of the date on which the Closing Statements become
final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with the terms hereof, joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement to deliver the entire balance of the Working Capital Escrow
Account to Seller or its designee.

 

 

(ii) If the Aggregate Consideration as set forth on the Final Statement is
less than the Estimated Aggregate Consideration, then Seller and Purchaser
shall deliver, within one Business Day of the date on which the Closing
Statements become final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with the
terms hereof, joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement to deliver from the Working Capital
Escrow Account to Purchaser or its designee, an amount equal to difference;
provided, that if the funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account are not
sufficient to pay the full amount require to be paid to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 2.04(d)(ii), then the balance of such amount shall be paid by
Seller within ten Business Days after the Aggregate Consideration becomes
final and binding on the Parties (as set forth on the Final Statement), by
wire transfer to Purchaser in immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Purchaser. If there are any funds in the Working
Capital Escrow Account after the foregoing payment is made to Purchaser or
its designee, then the joint instructions of Seller and Purchaser delivered
to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
shall include joint written instructions to deliver from the Working Capital
Escrow Account such excess funds to Seller.

 

 

SECTION 2.05. Required Withholding. All payments of Aggregate Consideration
and adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration shall be subject to any
withholding(s) required by law.

 

 

SECTION 2.06. Timing of Transfer. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, title to the Shares and the Acquired Assets will be conveyed
to Purchaser simultaneous with the payment by Purchaser of the Estimated
Aggregate Consideration pursuant to a funds flow memorandum to be agreed upon
in good faith by the Parties at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
(which funds flow will include, among other line items, the wiring of funds
directly to the Agent (as defined in the BTMUCC Credit Facility), on behalf
of Seller and the Co-Issuers (as defined in the BTMUCC Credit Facility), in
accordance with the Accord and Satisfaction Agreement and Payoff Letter.

SECTION 3.21. Franchise Matters.

 

 

(a) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (i) subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity exception, each Franchise Agreement is valid and
binding on Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such
Subsidiary is a party thereto, as applicable, and to the Knowledge of Seller,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, (ii) Seller and each of its Subsidiaries, and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto, has performed all
obligations required to be performed by it under each Franchise Agreement,
(iii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
of the existence of any event or condition which constitutes, or, after
notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a default on the part of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under any Franchise Agreement from any
other Franchisee, (iv) there are no events or conditions which constitute,
or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute a default on the
part of any counterparty under such Franchise Agreement, (v) to the Knowledge
of Seller, neither Seller nor any Subsidiary has not received any written
notice from any Franchisee that such Franchisee is claiming that
the franchisor is in breach of any Franchise Agreement, intends to terminate,
or not renew, any Franchise Agreement, or is seeking the renegotiation
thereof in any material respect or substitute performance thereunder in any
material respect, and (vi) the completion of the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not cause the expiration, termination or constitute a
breach of any Franchise Agreement, or the acceleration of any payment
obligation or the alteration of any material terms of any Franchise
Agreement. The Franchise Agreements comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws. No Franchise Agreement contains a provision that requires
the consent or approval of the Franchisee to the Transactions and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any
oral or written representation, warranty or covenant to any Franchisee that a
change of control of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries will not occur or that
such Franchisee's consent to any change of control would be sought or
obtained prior to or as part of any such change of control. No Franchise
Agreement is subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or
defense, and neither the terms of the Franchise Agreement, nor the
exercise of any rights thereunder, will render the Franchise Agreement
unenforceable, in whole or in part, nor give to the Franchisee any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, except in each case as would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) As of the date hereof, except for Persons who have signed Commitment
Agreements (as defined in the applicable FDD used by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries) substantially in the form attached to the applicable FDD and
existing Franchise Agreements under which the Franchisee has the right to
develop multiple franchised businesses (each of which are identified on
Section 3.21(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter), no Franchisee or other
Person has any enforceable right of first refusal, option or other right or
arrangement to sign any Franchise Agreement or acquire any franchise from
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) To the Knowledge of Seller, all funds administered by or paid to Seller
or any Subsidiary on behalf of one or more Franchisees at any time since
January 1, 2007, including funds that Franchisees contributed for advertising
and promotion and rebates and other payments made by suppliers and other
third parties on account of Franchisees' purchases from those suppliers and
third parties, have been in all material respects administered and spent in
accordance with all applicable Laws and the Franchise Agreements.

 

 

(d) Either the applicable FDD or Section 3.21(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter contains a summary of all Franchise-related Actions which are pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing by any Franchisee or
association purporting to represent a group of Franchisees except where such
Actions have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

FDDs that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries have used to offer or sell
Franchises at any time since January 1, 2007. Seller has delivered to
Purchaser accurate and complete copies of each such FDD. All FDDs that Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries have used to offer or sell franchises at any time
since January 1, 2007 have complied in all material respects as to form and
content with the FTC Rule and other Franchise Laws and have otherwise been
delivered to prospective Franchisees in compliance in all material respects
with the Franchise Laws, and no such FDD contains any statement which is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein not false or misleading in light of the circumstances
under which they are made.

 

 

(f) Section 3.21(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth, with respect
to each applicable Subsidiary, a list of the jurisdictions in which Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries is currently registered or authorized to offer and
sell Franchises, or is exempt from such registration, under a Franchise Law.
There are no stop orders or other material proceedings in effect or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing that prohibit or materially impede
the ability of Seller and its Subsidiaries to offer or sell Franchises or
enter into Franchise Agreements.

 

 

(g) Seller and the Subsidiaries are, and since January 1, 2007 have been, in
compliance with all Franchise Laws and have not offered or sold any Franchise
in violation of any Franchise Law (including by filing on a timely basis all
required amendments and renewals of the registrations and exemptions under
the Franchise Laws), except for such non-compliance as would not either
individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(h) To the Knowledge of Seller, with respect to all terminations, non-
renewals, and transfers of Franchises since January 1, 2007, Seller and the
applicable Subsidiary have complied in all material respects with all
applicable franchise termination, unfair practices, and/or relationship Laws,

parties (other than Governmental Authorities) and use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain such third party consents as are necessary in connection
with the Transactions. Purchaser shall cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts to assist Seller in giving such notices and obtaining
such consents. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, except as set forth in Section 5.03(b) of the Seller Disclosure

SECTION 5.04. Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, each Party
shall, promptly after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence (or non-
occurrence) of any event, circumstance or fact arising subsequent to the date
of this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty or covenant of such
Party in this Agreement, give notice thereof to the other Party and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent or to remedy promptly such breach;
provided, however, that the delivery of, or failure to deliver, any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder and shall not be or be deemed to be a cure for
any such breach.

 

 

SECTION 5.05. Insurance. (a) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
keep, or cause to be kept, all current insurance policies to the extent
relating to the NC Business, in full force and effect through the close of
business on the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 5.05(d), as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, Seller may terminate or cause its Affiliates to terminate insurance
coverage relating to the NC Business (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Assets) under the general corporate
policies of insurance of Seller for the benefit of all of its controlled
Subsidiaries, but not any policy that covers exclusively one or more Acquired
Companies or any of the Acquired Assets (and does not cover any Excluded
Assets or any entity that is not an Acquired Company). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not terminate any occurrence based insurance policy
unless the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to coverage under, in
accordance with the terms of, such policy with respect to events occurring
prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that the NC Business shall be
responsible for any deductible payable under the terms of the applicable
policy in connection with any such claims policy).

related provisions thereof).

coverage with respect to all directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies providing coverage to Seller and each of its Subsidiaries (including
the Acquired Companies) prior to the Closing (the "DandO Covered Parties").
The tail coverage shall have a runoff term of at least six years and shall be
placed with deductible levels, retentions, levels of coverage and other terms
at least as favorable to the DandO Covered Parties as the existing policies,
and such tail policy shall include such endorsements as Purchaser may
reasonably request.

 

 

SECTION 5.06. Books and Records.

 

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause
their officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate
with each other, for a period of 24 months after the Closing to ensure the
orderly transition of the NC Business from Seller to Purchaser and to
minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of Seller and Purchaser
that might result from the Transactions. Any costs or expenses which arise
from the Parties' compliance with this Section 5.06 shall be borne by the
Party requesting such action, access, assistance or delivery.

 

 

(b) For a period of 24 months after the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
Purchaser and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
their employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access, during normal
business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the NC
Business and the Acquired NC Assets as is reasonably necessary for the
transition of the Continuing Employees, financial reporting and accounting
matters, the prosecution or defense of legal proceedings, the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns or the defense of any Tax audit, claim or
assessment. Neither Party shall be required by this Section 5.06 to take any
action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations or result in any actual breach of
the Law or give rise to any other actual compliance concern.

 

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practical after the Closing Date but in no event
later than 10 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Purchaser all Records in the possession of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) relating to the NC Business;
provided, however, that:

 

 

(i) Purchaser recognizes that certain Records may relate primarily to Seller
or to subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the NC Business and that
Seller may retain such Records and shall provide true and complete copies of
the relevant portions thereof to Purchaser,

 

 

(ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in connection with
discussions held with other parties and analyses relating to any alternative
to the Transactions; and


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Seller may retain any Tax Returns and Purchaser shall be provided with
copies of such Tax Returns only to the extent that they relate to separate
Tax Returns or separate Liability for Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies,
Acquired Assets or Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION 5.07. Further Action. Prior to and after the Closing, each of the
Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable, in the reasonable opinion of Purchaser, under applicable Law,
and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required
to consummate the Transactions and to carry out and effectuate the purpose
and intent of this Agreement, including to effect the transfer of all of the
Acquired NC Assets (including benefits plans and insurance policies (other
than Seller's directors and officers policies) to Purchaser and facilitate
the assignment and assumption of any Assumed Liabilities by Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION 5.08. Confidentiality. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the
information provided or to be provided to it in connection with the
Transactions is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the
terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only
upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect
to information relating solely to the NC Business; provided, however,
that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it
by Seller or Seller's representatives concerning Seller shall remain subject
to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the
Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreements, any Party to this Agreement (and any
employee, representative or other agent of such Party) may disclose to any
and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and Tax
structure of the Transactions and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure to the extent required by Code Section 6011 and
the regulations thereunder in order to avoid the Transactions being treated
as a "Confidential Transaction" as defined by such regulations, except that
(i) this provision shall not permit disclosure until the earliest of (A) the
date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the Transactions,
(B) the date of the public announcement of the Transactions or (C) the date
of the execution of an agreement (with or without - conditions) to enter into
the Transactions and (ii) this provision shall not permit disclosure to the
extent that nondisclosure is necessary in order to comply with applicable
securities laws. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit any Party's
ability to consult any Tax advisor (including a Tax advisor independent from
all other entities involved in the Transaction) regarding the Tax treatment
or Tax structure of the Transaction or to respond to or otherwise comply with
any request from any Taxing Authority (including Tax audits).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) Seller recognizes that by reason of its ownership of the NC Business it
and its Affiliates have acquired confidential information and trade secrets
concerning the operation of the NC Business, the use or disclosure of which
could cause Purchaser or its Affiliates substantial loss and damages that
could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy at law would
be adequate. Accordingly, Seller covenants to Purchaser that Seller and its
Affiliates will not, for a period of three years following the date of
this Agreement, except in performance of its obligations to Purchaser or with
the prior written consent of Purchaser, directly or indirectly, disclose
any proprietary, secret or confidential information relating to the NC
Business that it may learn or has learned by reason of its ownership of the
NC Business, unless (i) it is in the public domain or comes into the public
domain (other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates),
(ii) it is generally made available to third parties without any limitation
on its use or disclosure, (iii) is disclosed to Seller or its Affiliates by a
third party having the right to do so, (iv) disclosure is required by
applicable Law (including in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or
the conduct of any Tax audit), or (v) disclosure is necessary to enforce any
of Seller's or its Affiliates rights.

 

 

SECTION 5.09. Excluded Assets; Excluded Liabilities. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall cause (a) all Excluded Assets that reside in any Acquired
Company to be transferred to Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller (other than any
Acquired Company), and (b) the Excluded Liabilities that reside in
any Acquired Company to be discharged or assumed by Seller or a Subsidiary of
Seller (other than an Acquired Company), in each case without Liability to
any Acquired Company or Purchaser.

 

 

SECTION 5.10. Proxy Statement; Stockholders' Meeting.

 

 

(a) Proxy Statement. Seller shall engage a proxy solicitation firm (which
proxy solicitation firm shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser)
and prepare (with the reasonable assistance of Purchaser) and file a
preliminary proxy statement relating to the Stockholders' Meeting (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement")
as soon as practicable following the date hereof (and, in any event, within
10 Business Days from the date of this Agreement) with the SEC and Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
preparation of the foregoing; provided, that if such 10 Business Day period
is deemed insufficient in Seller's good faith, reasonable judgment for the
fulsome preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, then with the consent
of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), such
period shall be extended for 5 additional Business Days. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver an initial draft of the Proxy Statement to
Purchaser within 5 Business Days of the date of this Agreement. The Proxy
Statement shall include the Board Recommendation. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the reasonable assistance of
Purchaser) as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its
staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Seller's stockholders
at the earliest practicable time after the resolution of all such comments.
Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Purchaser with copies of all correspondence
between Seller or any of Seller's Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the Transactions as promptly as commercially practical after receipt thereof.
If at any time prior to the Stockholders' Meeting there shall occur any event
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, Seller shall promptly after becoming aware thereof,
inform Purchaser of such fact or event and prepare (with the reasonable
assistance of Purchaser) and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law. Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser will furnish to Seller in writing all information as
Seller may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and the
preparation of the proxy Statement, including all information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect thereto, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement or
respond and shall consider in good faith comments reasonably proposed by
Purchaser and shall not unreasonably exclude the comments provided by
Purchaser.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Stockholders' Meeting. Seller shall, as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its holders of Common Stock for
the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval (the
"Stockholders' Meeting"). The Stockholders' Meeting shall be held as
promptly as commercially practicable following the date on which the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller may adjourn or postpone the
Stockholders' Meeting after consultation with Purchaser and with Purchaser's
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (i) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of Seller within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Stockholders' Meeting or (ii) if as of the
time for which the Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Stockholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to Article VII, if the Board shall have withheld,
withdrawn, qualified or modified the Board Recommendation, or issued an
Adverse Recommendation Change, Seller shall nonetheless submit this Agreement
to its stockholders at the Stockholders' Meeting. With Purchaser's consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Seller may also
seek the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Seller's Common Stock of the dissolution of Seller at the
Stockholders' Meeting.

 

 

(c) Plan of Dissolution; Distribution. The Board will, subject to its
fiduciary duties, submit to the stockholders of Seller for their approval, a
plan of dissolution that will provide that, subject to the fiduciary duties
of the members of the Board, Seller will be dissolved after the Closing and
its remaining assets will be distributed to its stockholders as promptly as
the Board determines in good faith is advisable, taking into account
applicable Law and the Liabilities of Seller and its remaining Subsidiaries
after the Closing.

 

 

(d) No Restriction. Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall be deemed to prevent
Seller or the Board from taking any action they are permitted or required to
take under or are required to take under applicable Law. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Seller's or any Company's operations prior to the Closing
Date.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 5.11. No Solicitation of Transactions.

 

 

(a) Seller shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of
its Subsidiaries and each of their Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties
(other than Purchaser and its Representatives) that may be ongoing as of the
date hereof with respect to a Takeover Proposal. Seller shall not, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause each Subsidiary and its Representatives
not to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage
any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement or agreement in
principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal or (iii) participate in any way
in any negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish or disclose to any
third party any information with respect to, any Takeover Proposal.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time
on or after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval,
in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal from a Person, other
than the senior secured lender to Seller's Subsidiaries, which the Board
reasonably determines appears to be capable of pursuing such Takeover
Proposal that (i) was not solicited in violation of this Section 5.11 by
Seller, any Subsidiary of Seller or any of their respective Representatives,
(ii) does not contain any financing contingency and (iii) provides for gross
consideration to be received by Seller and/or its stakeholders of at least
$117,500,001, the Company may (x) furnish information and/or draft agreements
with respect to Seller and the Companies to the Person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (provided that all such information and a summary of the material
terms of any such draft agreements have previously been made available to
Purchaser or is made available to Purchaser prior to, or concurrently with,
the time it is provided to such Person) and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal; provided, further that
Seller shall promptly provide to Purchaser (and in any event within 24 hours)
(1) a copy of any Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries, and the identity of the Person making the Takeover
Proposal, and (2) a written summary of the material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal not made in writing.

 

 

(c) Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal on
a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours) and shall notify Purchaser
of the status of such Takeover Proposal. Seller agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits Seller from providing
any information to Purchaser in accordance with this Section 5.11.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall
restrict Seller, any Subsidiary of Seller or any of their respective
Representatives from participating in discussions or negotiations with
respect to any matter, or otherwise furnishing any information to, BTMU
Capital Corporation or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives with respect to a Takeover Proposal that is not sponsored and
led by the senior secured lender to Seller's Subsidiaries.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.11(e), the Board shall
not (i) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Purchaser, the Board Recommendation, (ii) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a Takeover Proposal
that is structured as either a tender offer or an exchange offer other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
stockholders of Seller a Takeover Proposal (actions described in clauses (i)
to (iii) being referred to as a "Adverse Recommendation Change")), or (iv)
authorize, cause or permit Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any Seller Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not
after, the Board may, in response to a Takeover Proposal that the Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and its
independent financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize, cause or permit Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into a Seller Acquisition Agreement with respect to
a Takeover Proposal, if, in the case of any such action, the Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of Seller's directors under applicable
Law; provided, however, that (w) Seller has given Purchaser at least five
Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal), (x)
Seller has negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Purchaser during such notice
period to the extent Purchaser wishes to negotiate, to enable Purchaser to
revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) following the
end of such notice period, the Board shall have considered in good faith
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Purchaser, and shall
have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In the event
that during such notice period any revisions are made to terms of such
Superior Proposal and the Board in its good faith judgment reasonably
determines that such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change
in the purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material
revision), Seller shall, in each case, deliver to Purchaser an additional
notice and a notice period of three Business Days shall have recommenced from
the date of receipt of such additional notice unless the event requiring
notice pursuant to this Section 5.11(e) occurred less than three Business
Days prior to the Stockholders' Meeting, in which case Seller shall deliver
notice to Purchaser of such event as promptly as practicable. For clarity and
the avoidance of doubt, Seller will not enter into any agreement with any
party in contravention or inconsistent with this Section 5.11.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in
this Section 5.11 shall prohibit or restrict Seller or the Board from (i)
taking and/or disclosing to the stockholders of Seller a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of Seller if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board, such disclosure would be reasonably necessary under applicable
Law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 5.12. Employee Benefits Matters.

 

 

(a) Prior to Closing but effective upon the Closing Date, Purchaser or an
Affiliate thereof shall make offers of employment to the employees of the
Asset Sellers; provided, however, that such offers of employment shall be
sufficient so as to give rise to no Seller liability under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, or any similar Law
(collectively, the "WARN Act"). Purchaser shall include in its offers of
employment a release to be entered into by the employee in favor of the
Seller and its Affiliates, provided, however, that if an employee objects to
the release, Purchaser shall not be required to retain the release as a
condition of employment. Each such employee who is offered and accepts
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof shall be considered a
"Continuing Employee" on the date their employment with such employer
commences. For a period of no less than 12 months following the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee,
compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee by Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing. The preceding sentence shall not
preclude Purchaser or its Affiliates at any time following the Closing from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason (or no
reason).

 

 

(b) Provided that on or before the Closing, Seller has provided Purchaser
with a list of all employee layoffs, by date and location, implemented by the
Assets Sellers in the 90-day period preceding the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not take any action (including layoffs) which will result in any
Liability to Seller under the WARN Act.

 

 

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to transfer and
assign effective on the Closing Date each Seller Employee Plan (other than
Seller's 401(k) plan) and NC Employment Agreement of any Asset Seller
employee set forth on Section 5.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter to
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, and Seller shall take all actions
necessary to terminate any existing Seller Employee Plan which is not set
forth on Section 5.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(d) Subject to Purchaser being reasonably satisfied, consistent with the
regulations under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, that Seller's 401(k) plan
meets the requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code,
and that all matching under Purchaser's 401(k) plans is provided for in
Seller's 401(k) Plan, Purchaser agrees to cause Purchaser\'s 401(k) plan to
accept, a "direct rollover" to Purchaser\'s 401 (k) plan of each Continuing
Employee\'s account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) under Seller's 401(k) plan if such rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable Law by such Continuing Employee. On or prior to
the Closing, Seller shall terminate Seller's 401(k) plan.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(e) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with
Seller and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any
Seller Employee Plan, including any such plans providing vacation, sick pay,
severance and retirement benefits maintained by Purchaser in which such
Continuing Employees participate for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of retirement type benefits), to the extent
past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under the
comparable Seller Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and to the
same extent past service is credited under such plans or arrangements for
similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall be construed to require crediting of
service that would result in duplication of benefits or service credit for
benefit accruals under a retirement type plan.

 

 

(f) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Continuing
Employees following the Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any such
welfare benefit plans to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would not apply in the absence of such change, and (ii) for
the plan year in which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each Continuing
Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change
in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after
such change.

 

 

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall each provide the other (and their designated
agents and third-party service providers) with prompt liaison necessary for
them (and their agents and third-party service providers) implement these
covenants; provided, however, that each party shall comply with the HIPAA
privacy and security rules and other applicable Laws relating to the
protection of health data, in the implementation of these covenants.

 

 

(h) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.12 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,
and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any Continuing Employee,
any participant in any employee benefit plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 

 

(i) Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any severance payments (but no other
amounts) arising under the agreements listed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Section
ACA of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the extent such obligations are
triggered (and not waived or otherwise released by the employees who are
parties to such agreements) as a result of a termination of employment in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

 

 

SECTION 5.13. Retention Bonus Plan. As soon as practicable following the
date hereof (and, in any event, within 10 Business Days), Seller shall
implement a retention bonus plan on such terms and conditions as are
reasonably consented to by Purchaser) (the "Retention Bonus Plan") which
provides for aggregate payments of up to $290,000 (maximum payments of
$145,000 to be payable on each of (i) the Closing Date by Seller (or one of
its Affiliates) (the "Seller Retention Portion") and (ii) six months
following the Closing Date by Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) (the
"Purchaser Retention Portion")) to the NC Employees listed, and in the
amounts set forth, in Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter who become
Continuing Employees and remain employed by Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates as of the applicable payment bonus payment date; provided that if
the actual amount of the Purchaser Retention Portion incurred by Purchaser
and its Affiliates in connection with the Retention Bonus Plan is less than
$145,000, one half of such shortfall shall be promptly (but in no event less
than 5 Business Days after the six month anniversary of Closing) be paid in
cash to Seller by wire transfer to an account designated by Seller.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

SECTION 5.14. Director Resignations. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the written resignation(s) of each director of any Acquired
Company identified by Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to Closing
Date, effective as of the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION 5.15. Deposit Account Control Agreement. In consideration for the
mutual covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement, Seller
hereby grants for the exclusive benefit of Purchaser an Encumbrance upon and
security interest in a bank account (the "Deposit Account") to be established
as soon as practicable following the date hereof (and, in any event, within 7
Business Days). Seller shall execute a deposit account control agreement
(such agreement, including any subordination or intercreditor agreement
relating to the Deposit Account, the "Deposit Account Control Agreement") in
favor of Purchaser providing for a first lien on such Deposit Account (the
terms of which are reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser and shall
include that no funds shall be withdrawn therefrom, unless expressly provided
for in the Deposit Account Control Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser). The Deposit Account shall maintain a balance no less
than $500,000, such amount to be disbursed to Purchaser in satisfaction of
any amounts as may be due to Purchaser as set forth in Section 7.02(c). In
the event that all amounts due and payable to Purchaser under Section 7.02(c)
have been satisfied, any remaining balance in the Deposit Account shall be
released to Seller (or an account designated by Seller) within one Business
Day of such satisfaction date, and Purchaser shall take all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, as may be required to release such balance to Seller.

 

 

SECTION 5.16. Extension of Accord and Satisfaction Agreement. Seller may,
and, if requested by Purchaser, shall, use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain an extension of the Effectiveness Deadline (as such term is defined
in the Accord and Satisfaction Agreement) from October 1, 2010 to the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
any action taken, or not taken, with the consent of Purchaser in connection
with Seller's compliance with its obligations hereunder shall not be deemed a
breach of this or any other provision of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.17. Enforcement of Certain Rights. Seller shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts (which,
for this purpose, will include, at its cost, initiating and pursuing
litigation in order to enforce its rights) to enforce its rights under the
Accord and Satisfaction Agreement and the Deposit Account Control
Agreement or to cause the secured lender to enter into the subordination or
intercreditor agreement as contemplated in Section 5.15. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any action taken, or not taken, with the
consent of Purchaser in connection with Seller's compliance with its
obligations hereunder shall not be deemed a breach of this or any other
provision of this Agreement.

on such Tax Returns as owing.

that notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, Seller
shall be entitled to a refund of Taxes from the City of New York for the year
2006 and, if necessary, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to
assist Seller (at Seller's expense) in obtaining this refund.

 

 

SECTION 6.03. Cooperation. The Share Sellers, the Asset Sellers, the
Acquired Companies, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives reasonably to cooperate, in

matters relating to Taxes, including (a) by maintaining and making available
to each other all books and records and all relevant correspondence with

informing each other of notice of any Tax audit or other Tax proceeding in
respect of which the other Party or any of its Affiliates may have a
Liability.

 

 

SECTION 6.04. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and applicable real estate transfer and stock transfer Taxes

file Tax Returns (including but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all respects
and for all purposes consistent with such allocation. Neither Seller
nor Purchaser shall take any position (whether in audits, tax returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so
by applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Seller (rather than Purchaser) shall take into account any income
resulting from cancellation or modification of the BTMUCC Credit Facility on
the Closing Date, and the Parties shall not elect or deem to have elected to
treat any such modification as a modification of a debt of Purchaser pursuant

Termination

 

 

SECTION 7.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser,

 

 

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller:

 

 

(i) if the Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting
or any adjournment thereof at which this Agreement has been voted upon;

 

 

(ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred by November 13, 2010 (such date,
or such later date as the Parties may agree to the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision
of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date; or


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Transactions
illegal or otherwise prohibited or any Governmental Order of any Governmental
Authority having competent jurisdiction is entered enjoining Seller or
Purchaser from consummating the Transactions and such Governmental Order has
become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that prior to termination
pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(iii) each of the Parties shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent under, resolve or
lift, as applicable, the Law or Order and shall have complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Agreement; provided, further,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(b)(iii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in the imposition of any such
Governmental Order or the failure of such Governmental Order to be resisted,
resolved or lifted, as applicable.

 

 

(c) by Seller:

 

 

(i) if Purchaser shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 2.03 and (B) cannot be cured by
Purchaser, or if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 15
Business Days follow receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from Seller (or, if earlier, the Outside Date); provided
that, Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.01(c)(i) if it is then in material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 2.02 not being
satisfied; or

 

 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, in order to enter into
a Seller Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if, (A)
Seller has complied in all material respects with the requirements of Section
5.11 and (B) prior to or concurrently with such termination, Seller pays the
amounts due to Purchaser under Section 7.02.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) by Purchaser:

 

 

(i) if (A) Seller shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (except the covenants and agreements in Section 5.11), which breach
or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 2.02 and (ii) cannot be cured by Seller, or if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured within 15 Business Days following
receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
Purchaser (or, if earlier, the Outside Date); provided that, Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(d)(i) if it is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 2.03 not being satisfied, (B)
Seller shall have willfully or intentionally breached in any material respect
its obligations under, or shall have knowingly permitted any of its
Representatives to materially breach the terms of, Section 5.11, which
breach, if curable by Seller, shall not have been cured by Seller within 5
Business Days following receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach,
(C) the Accord and Satisfaction Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the related Waiver and Omnibus Amendment) is terminated, deemed null
and void in accordance with the terms thereof or amended without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (D) the failure of the Seller to enter
into, and to cause the secured lender to enter into, the Deposit Account
Control Agreement as required under Section 5.15; or

 

 

(ii) if (A) the Board shall have failed to include the Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (B) the Board shall have effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (C) the Board shall have failed to recommend against
any publicly announced Takeover Proposal and reaffirm the Board
Recommendation, in each case, within 5 Business Days following a request by
Purchaser to do so and in any event at least 2 Business Days prior to the
Stockholders' Meeting (provided that Purchaser cannot make repeated requests
for reaffirmation with respect to the same Takeover Proposal unless there has
been a material change in the terms of such Takeover Proposal (as reasonably
determined by the Board and, for the avoidance of doubt, any change in price
or financing contingency will be deemed to be a material change for the
purposes of this sentence) since the date of Purchaser's most recent request
for reaffirmation), (D) Seller enters into a Seller Acquisition Agreement, or
(E) Seller or the Board shall have publicly announced its intention to do any
of the foregoing.

 

 

SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.

 

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.02, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement by either Seller or Purchaser as provided in
Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be
no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser or Seller or their
respective officers or directors; provided, however, that the provisions of
this Section 7.02, Section 7.03 and Article 8 and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement; provided, further, that no Party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii), then
Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to $4,500,000 (the "Termination
Fee") prior to or concurrently with such termination. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01 (d)(i)(B) or Section 7.01(d)(ii),
then Seller shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to the Termination Fee within
1 Business Day of such termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Sections 7.01(b)(i), 7.01(b)(ii), 7.01(d)(i)(C) or 7.01(d)(i)(D) then, in
the event that within 12 months of the date this Agreement is terminated,
Seller consummates any Takeover Proposal or enters into a Seller Acquisition
Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal and such Takeover Proposal is
consummated (whether during or after such 12 month period) (either such
consummated Takeover Proposal shall be referred to as a "Takeover
Event Closing"), then Seller shall pay Purchaser the Termination
Fee concurrently with such Takeover Event Closing. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i)(A), then Seller shall pay
Purchaser an amount equal to $2,250,000 (the "Reduced Termination Fee")
within 1 Business Day after such termination; provided, that in the event
that a Takeover Event Closing subsequently occurs, Seller shall pay Purchaser
the Termination Fee (less the amount of the Reduced Termination
Fee previously paid) concurrently with such Takeover Event Closing.

 

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 7.01(b)(i),
7.01(b)(ii), 7.01(c)(ii), 7.01(d)(i) or 7.01(d)(ii), then Seller shall pay by
wire transfer of same day funds to Purchaser or its designee(s) within one
Business Day following the delivery by Purchaser of an invoice therefor, all
out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Purchaser Expenses"). If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 7.01(b)(iii), and the primary cause of the promulgation
of such Law or issuance of such Order was an Action initiated by (i) the SEC
or (ii) by the stockholders of Seller relating to allegations of breach of
fiduciary duties or other allegations of a violation of applicable Law
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, then Seller shall pay by wire
transfer of same day funds to Purchaser or its designee(s) within one
Business Day following the delivery by Purchaser of an invoice therefor, all
Purchaser Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no circumstances
shall Seller ever be required to pay more than an aggregate of $500,000
pursuant to this Section 7.02(c).

 

 

(d) In the event that Purchaser shall receive full payment of all amounts
owed by Seller pursuant to Sections 7.02(b) and 7.02(c), the receipt of
such applicable Termination Fee and/or Purchaser Expenses shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages (and not a penalty) for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Purchaser, any of
its Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against Seller or any of its Affiliates arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

 

 

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.02 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if Seller fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.02,
and, in order to obtain the payment, Purchaser commences a suit which results
in a judgment against Seller for the payment set forth in this Section 7.02,
Seller shall pay Purchaser its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Within 10 Business Days of the date hereof, Purchaser shall open a new
bank account and provide Seller with wire transfer instructions to this bank
account (the "Default Account"). Any amount due to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 7.02 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Default Account, or to such other account designated in writing
to Seller by Purchaser; provided that, in all circumstances, payment to the
Default Account shall satisfy the obligations imposed by this Section 7.02;
and, provided, further, that, once opened, Purchaser hereby agrees to keep
open and available for wire transfers the Default Account for so long as the
potential for a payment to Purchaser under this Article VII remains. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller be obligated to pay, or cause to
paid, the Termination Fee or the Reduced Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 

 

SECTION 7.03. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Closing occurs.

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 8.05. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant, restriction or
other condition of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other terms, provisions,
covenants, restrictions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the

in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party; provided that Purchaser may assign or

any Affiliate of Purchaser without the prior written consent of Seller

affect the obligations of Purchaser under, this Agreement, (ii) affect the
obligations of the Fund under the Equity Commitment Agreement or (iii) impede
or delay the consummation of the Transactions). Any purported assignment

SECTION 8.10. Captions. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored as in the construction or interpretation
hereof.

 

 

SECTION 8.11. Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof. If any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party hereto, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during
which such Action is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Action. If a court of
competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations
of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions pursuant to a claim for specific
performance brought against Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.11, Seller
may pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including
monetary damages (which Purchaser agrees shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit
of the bargain lost by Seller's stockholders and creditors). If a court has
granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against Purchaser, Seller
may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

SECTION 8.12. Public Announcement. The initial press release regarding the
Transactions shall be mutually agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser. Prior to
Closing, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall issue or make any subsequent
press release or other public statement with respect to the Transactions

by Law, provided that in any such case the disclosing Party shall provide the
non-disclosing Party with adequate notice of any such proposed disclosure and
a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.

contained in Article III and Article IV or contained in any certificate or
any writing delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement hereunder. The covenants of Purchaser and
Seller contained in the Agreement shall not survive the Closing other than
those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply, or
that are to be performed in whole or in part, after the Closing, which shall
survive the Closing until fully performed.
