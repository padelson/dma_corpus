AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, as such period may be
extended by Parent and the Purchaser if and to the extent the Company fails to
satisfy its obligations pursuant to the _Section 1.1(g)(iv)_), the Purchaser
shall commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the
Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares for cash at the Offer Price.
The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept
for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and any
obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer), shall be subject to: (i) there being
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of
Shares (if any) then owned by Parent or any of its wholly-owned direct or
indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, represents at least a majority
of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no
less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the
Company

 



-2- ##### Table of Contents

  

_ _ then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to
vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (excluding
from the number of tendered Shares, but not from the number of outstanding
Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (to the
extent such procedures are permitted by the Purchaser) that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) (collectively, the
" _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser
(to the extent permitted in _Annex I_ ), of each of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_. Subject to _Annex I_ , the conditions
and requirements to the Offer set forth in this _Section 1.1_ and _Annex I_
are for the sole benefit of the Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be
waived by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time. __

 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by the Purchaser (to the extent permitted by _Annex I_ ), of each
of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, upon the first
Expiration Date (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section
1.1(e)_) upon which such conditions are satisfied or waived, cause the
Acceptance Time to occur, and the Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to, pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event
not more than three (3) Business Days) following the Acceptance Time. The
Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid, without interest, subject to
any applicable withholding taxes. To the extent any such amounts are so
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

__(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing, which approval may be withheld in Companys sole
discretion, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than adding
consideration), (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in
the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition or the condition set
forth in clause (b) of _Annex I_ , (v) impose any condition or requirement on
the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex I_ , (vi) except as provided
in _Section 1.1(e)_, extend the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer in
any manner that is adverse to the holder of Shares. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Shares), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the Shares, occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price
shall provide to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , that nothing
in this sentence shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
with respect to its securities that is not permitted by the terms of this
Agreement. __

 



-3- ##### Table of Contents

  

__(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer shall initially expire at midnight (New York City time) at the end of
the day on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days (calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) (such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended as required by or otherwise
permitted by this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been so
extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). _ _

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, any condition to the
Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) has not been satisfied, or, where
permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement and _Annex I_ , waived by the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser
to), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for successive periods of up
to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of each such period (subject to
such ten (10) Business Day maximum) to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions. In
addition, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend
the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff. If on or
prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all the conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied, or, where permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement
and _Annex I_ , waived by the Purchaser (other than conditions that, by their
nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing), and the full amount of the Debt
Financing has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at the
Acceptance Time, then the Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to extend the Offer for one (1) period of up to ten (10) Business
Days, so long as no such extension would result in the Offer being extended
beyond the third (3rd) Business Day immediately preceding the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond June 30, 2017 (the "
_Outside Date_ "). Nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ hereof.

(f) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ , the Purchaser shall promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of
Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 

 __(g) (i) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the
Offer, the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall include, as exhibits, the Offer __

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

 to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). (ii) The Purchaser may, in its
sole discretion, provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of
Shares in the Offer. (iii) The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. (iv) The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent and the Purchaser in writing all information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries and stockholders that may be required by applicable
securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or the Purchaser for
inclusion in the Offer Documents. (v) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act. (vi) The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. (vii) In addition, the Purchaser shall provide the Company
and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
(viii) The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review any such written responses and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. (ix) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Purchasers obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding
three sentences shall not apply if an Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC (which filing
shall not take place prior to the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the date
of this Agreement without the Companys prior written consent), the Company
shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to
the provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_, contain the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 a notice of
appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all
necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisors to permit the Company to
include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinions,
together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation
M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is applicable).
The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and hereby approves and
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation. The Company further agrees to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. To the extent requested by the Purchaser, the Company
shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the
holders of Shares

 together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The
Company, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its
counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide the Purchaser and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt
of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The Purchaser
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser
and its counsel.

(b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the
Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the
Purchaser with such information (including updated lists of holders of the
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) (the date of the list used to determine
the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first
disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ ") and such other assistance
as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with
the record and beneficial holders of Shares. The Company Board shall set the
Stockholder List Date as the record date for the purpose of receiving the
notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. In addition, in connection
with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any Third Parties to, cooperate with the Purchaser to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to
any Company Employee Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender
Shares in the Offer. Should the Offer terminate or if this Agreement shall be
terminated, Parent and Purchaser shall, upon request, deliver to the Company
or destroy (and confirm such destruction in writing) all copies of such
information provided by Company under this _Section 1.2(b)_ then in their
possession, and Company shall have no further obligations under this 
_Section 1.2(b)_.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. Subject to the terms hereof, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Purchaser, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes, upon surrender of such Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

 



-8- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by or held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
(including the Purchaser) or the Company, shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist, with no payment being made in exchange therefor.

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares
of common stock of the Purchaser shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a nationally recognized bank or payment company to act as the
paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment and distribution of the
Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
At or promptly after the Effective Time (and, in any event, on the Closing
Date), the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate consideration that the holders
of Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Option Consideration, the
RSU Consideration or the Warrant Consideration). Such funds shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
Purchaser, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders
of Shares. If, at any time following the Closing and prior to the delivery of
funds held by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
_Section 2.2(e)_, the cash deposited with the Paying Agent is insufficient to
pay the consideration that the holders of Shares are entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient to pay such
consideration.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in
each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the letter of transmittal, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five
(5) Business Days thereafter), upon (A) surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or such other agent or agents as

 



-9- ##### Table of Contents

  

 may be appointed by the Purchaser and delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) and delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, as applicable, the
holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (y) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holders
transferred Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, by
(z) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Tax pursuant to
_Section 2.2(f)_), and the Certificates or transferred Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates and transferred Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, and subject to _Section 2.3_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed from and after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
therefor upon surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article II_.

 

(c) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid any
transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, and established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

 

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. From and after
the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing any Shares shall
(other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares,
which shall be subject to _Section 2.3_) cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article II_  (or, for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, any
consideration that remains payable with respect to any Shares validly tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer). The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and
outstanding

 



-10- ##### Table of Contents

  

 immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to any Person as a result of the exercise of or in settlement
of Cashed Out Company Options, Cashed Out Company RSUs or Company Warrants,
and that such Cashed Out Company Options, Cashed Out Company RSUs and Company
Warrants shall be cancelled and the holders of such Cashed Out Company
Options, Cashed Out Company RSUs and Company Warrants shall only be entitled
to receive the consideration, if any, provided to them under _Section 2.4_
and shall not have any other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

 

(e) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
cash funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes. If immediately prior
to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in  _Section 2.2(b)_
to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
any other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



-11- ##### Table of Contents

  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, no Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and in respect of which appraisal rights shall have been
perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
Merger (collectively, " _ _Dissenting Shares__ ") shall be converted into a
right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in  _Section 2.1(a)_, but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the
DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the DGCL). In the event that any holder of Shares fails to make an effective
demand for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as to the Shares
or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting
Shares, then any such Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in respect of such
Shares as if such Shares had never been Dissenting Shares, in accordance with
and following the satisfaction of the applicable requirements and conditions
set forth in _Section 2.2_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and
in no event more than one (1) Business Day) of (i) any demand received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares (and shall give Parent the opportunity (at
Parents election) to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand) or (ii) any notice of exercise by any holder of
Shares of appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. The Company shall not
(and shall not agree to), without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle,
any such demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time __(" __ _Cashed Out
Company Options_ __") __shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective
Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Shares subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of such
Company Option (the " __ __ _Option Consideration_ __ __"). In the event that
any Cashed Out Company Option is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed to the
extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each holder of an
outstanding In-the-Money Company Option shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for the cancellation thereof the Option Consideration with
respect to each Share subject to such outstanding In-the-Money Company

 



-12- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Option and the Company shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of
such Company Option, if a current or former employee of the Company, through
the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or
former employee of the Company, through the Paying Agent, in each case,
payable as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and, in the case of
current or former employees of the Company, in no event later than the next
regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the
Closing Date).

(b) All Company Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options shall be
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for no
consideration. In no event shall the Company Options be assumed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting that occurs solely due to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a Contract as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) and is held by a Company Employee or
Company Service Provider shall be assumed by Parent and converted
automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit covering
Parent Common Stock having, subject to applicable Laws, the same terms and
conditions as the Company RSU (each, an  __" __ _Assumed RSU_ "), except that
(i) each such Company RSU will entitle the holder, upon settlement, to that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A)
the number of Shares that were issuable with regard to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) a fraction (such
ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Offer Price
and the denominator of which is the volume weighted average price for a share
of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, calculated to four
decimal places and determined without regard to after-hours trading or any
other trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours, for the
five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the third complete trading day
prior to (and excluding) the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., and
rounding such product down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, and (ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable
Company Stock Plans and the Company RSU agreements will be references to
Parent. The Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any
Company RSU (other than to implement any existing agreements or arrangements
for such acceleration in effect as of the date of this Agreement and set forth
on _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each
Person who holds an Assumed RSU a document evidencing the foregoing assumption
of such Assumed RSU by Parent.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and is not an Assumed RSU (including Company RSUs
for which the vesting is accelerated solely due to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to a Contract as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) (" _Cashed Out Company RSUs_ ")
shall vest in full to the extent unvested and be cancelled immediately prior
to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of
Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the Offer Price (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). In the event that any
Cashed Out Company RSU is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of
the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be

 



-13- ##### Table of Contents

  

 delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
Each holder of an outstanding Cashed Out Company RSU shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the RSU Consideration with
respect to each Share subject to such outstanding Company RSU and the Company
shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company RSU, if a
current or former employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former employee of the Company,
through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former employees
of the Company, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll
run of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date).

 

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each In-the-Money Company Warrant that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in accordance with
its terms, either (i) be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (" _Cashed Out Company
Warrant_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate
number of Shares for which such In-the-Money Company Warrant was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Offer Price over the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Company
Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ ") or (ii) exercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time and the Shares issued upon the exercise of such In-the-
Money Company Warrant shall be deemed outstanding and held by the holder of
such In-the-Money Company Warrant and shall be deemed to have been cancelled
in the Merger, and the holder shall have the right to receive (A) the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Shares in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_ less (B) the amount of the aggregate exercise price of the Shares;
_provided_ , _however_ , such In-the-Money Company Warrant may be exercised
in a cashless manner in accordance with its terms. Each holder of an
outstanding Cashed Out Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive in
exchange for the cancellation thereof the Warrant Consideration with respect
to each Share subject to such outstanding Cashed Out Company Warrant and the
Company shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Cashed Out
Company Warrant through the Paying Agent, payable as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date. All Company Warrants which are not In-the-Money
Company Warrants shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time in exchange for no consideration. In no event shall the Company Warrants
be assumed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(f) The Company shall send a written notice in a form provided in advance, and
reasonably acceptable, to Parent (i) to each holder of an outstanding Company
Option or Company RSU in accordance with the Company Stock Plan, and (ii) to
each holder of a Company Warrant in accordance with its terms, that shall
inform such holder of the treatment of the Company Options, Company RSUs or
Company Warrants, as applicable provided in this _Section 2.4_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.4_ or otherwise in this
Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of Company Options and Company RSUs
provided for in this _Section 2.4_ shall be effected in a manner consistent
with Section 409A of the Code.

 



-14- ##### Table of Contents

  

(h) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Warrant or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or
employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement
shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other equity
interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in
Parent, the Company, any of their Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 

(i) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take (or cause to be
taken) any and all action, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.4_, including
the cancellation without consideration of Company Options which are not In-
the-Money Company Options in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_
and cancellation of Company Warrants that are not In-the-Money Company
Warrants in accordance with _Section  2.4(e)_.

interest in, any Company IP, other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Except as set forth
in _Section 3.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is bound by, and no Company IP is subject to, any
Contract containing any covenant or other provision that in any way limits or

Liens (other than Permitted Liens and nonexclusive licenses granted in the

has transferred ownership of (whether a whole or partial interest), or

January 1, 2012, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any written claims challenging the Companys or the Company Subsidiarys
exclusive ownership of any Company IP or the validity or enforceability of any
Company IP. Each Person who is or was an employee, officer, director or
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and who contributed to
the conception or development of any Company IP has signed a (1) valid,
enforceable agreement containing an assignment to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, of all Intellectual Property Rights in such
Persons contribution to the Company IP except to the extent such
Intellectual Property Rights are not legally assignable as expressly
identified to the Company, and (2) waiver of any applicable moral rights. No
Person has notified the Company or any Company Subsidiary in writing that it
is claiming any ownership of or right to use any Company IP (other than the
right to use Company IP expressly granted to such Person under a Contract with
the Company). To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is (i) bound by or otherwise subject to any Contract

employer or other Person concerning Intellectual Property Rights or
confidentiality due to his activities as an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 

(e) _Registration; Validity_. The Company IP is, to the Knowledge of the

Subsidiary has made all filings and payments and taken all other actions
required by law to be made or taken to maintain each item of Company IP that
is Registered IP in full force and effect by the applicable deadline, except
where Company has decided to allow any such registration to lapse. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination,
or other Action is or since January 1, 2012, has been pending or threatened,
in which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any Company IP is being or
has been contested or challenged. No application for a Patent or a material
copyright, mask work, or Trademark registration or any other type of material
Registered IP filed by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
at any time since January 1, 2012 has been abandoned, allowed to lapse, or
rejected. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in patent
or copyright misuse or any fraud or inequitable conduct in connection with
any Registered IP. The Company and each Company Subsidiary and their patent
counsel have complied with their duty of candor and disclosure and

 



-35- ##### Table of Contents

  

 have made no material misrepresentations in the filings submitted to the
applicable Governmental Authorities with respect to all Patents included in
the Company IP. No Trademark owned, used, or applied for by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary conflicts or interferes with any Trademark owned, used,
and applied for by any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event
or circumstance (including a failure to exercise adequate quality controls
and an assignment in gross without the accompanying goodwill) has occurred or
exists that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the
abandonment of any material Trademark (whether registered or
unregistered) owned, used, or applied for by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. _Section 3.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
summary listing with respect to each item of Registered IP and all legally
required actions, filings and payment obligations known to Company as of the
Closing Date hereof and due to be made to any Governmental Authority within

Products nor the operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or violated, or infringes,
misappropriates, or violates, any Intellectual Property Right of any
Third Party. To the Knowledge of the Company, no infringement,
misappropriation, or similar claim or Action is pending or has been threatened
in writing against any Person who may be entitled to be indemnified by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under a Contract with the Company or a
Company Subsidiary with respect to such claim. Except as set forth in _Section
3.17(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2012, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written claim
alleging (i) the invalidity of any of the Company IP, (ii) that any Person has
any claim of legal or beneficial ownership or exclusive rights with respect to
any Company IP, or (iii) any infringement, misappropriation, or violation of
any Intellectual Property Right of another Person by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; and to the Companys Knowledge, there is no reasonable
basis for any such claim.

 

(g) _Infringement of Company IP_. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person
has infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, and no Person is
currently infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating, the
Intellectual Property Rights in any Company IP.

(h)  _Sufficiency_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or otherwise
have the right to use all Intellectual Property Rights and Technology used in,
held for use in, or necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company IP together
with all Company-owned Technology and the Third Party Intellectual Property
constitutes all of the Technology and Intellectual Property Rights necessary
to operate the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
currently conducted; provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed a
representation or warranty of non-infringement.

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and the Purchaser is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite organizational power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each of Parent and the
Purchaser is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, would not materially impair the ability of Parent and the
Purchaser to consummate, or prevent or materially delay, the Offer, Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.2  _Authority_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Purchaser has all necessary organizational power
and corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of Parent and the Purchaser, as applicable, and the
consummation by Parent and the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary organizational action, and no
other organizational proceedings on the part of Parent or the Purchaser and
no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than, with respect to
the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement has
been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by Parent and the
Purchaser, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of Parent and the
Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and the Purchaser in accordance with its
terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of

class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary or required
(including under the NASDAQ rules, the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or applicable Law) to approve this Agreement
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger. The vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of the Purchaser
(which shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Purchaser necessary to approve this Agreement or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the respective properties or

4.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no Order or Action pending,
or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or the

Company Subsidiary that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (B) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making such Competing Proposal.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours), notify Parent in the event that the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives receives (i)
any Competing Proposal or a Competing Inquiry, (ii) any request for non-

regarding any Competing Proposal. In connection with such notice, the Company
shall indicate the identity of such Person or group of Persons, provide
a description of the material terms and conditions of such Competing Inquiry,

materials provided in connection with such Competing Inquiry, Competing
Proposal, indication, or request, including any modifications thereto.
Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) on
a current basis (and in any event at Parents request and otherwise no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes, developments,
discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Competing Inquiry, Competing
Proposal, indication, or request (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and of any modification thereto), and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of all written
materials received by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective

with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

tender offer or exchange offer by the

 



-54- ##### Table of Contents

  

 stockholders of the Company (taking no position with respect to the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company, shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer) within five (5) Business Days after
commencement thereof or fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation
within two (2) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (iv) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Competing Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement (any of
the actions described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this  _Section 5.3(e)_,
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (v) cause or permit the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board shall be permitted to
effect any Adverse Recommendation Change (x) of a type described in clause (i)
above solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with
_Section 5.3(f)_, if the Company Board (A) has received a bona fide written
Competing Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with,
and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and
the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_ and (B) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (y) in response to an Intervening Event the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_
, that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event unless the Company (A) provides Parent with a
written description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) keeps
Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to such
Intervening Event, (C) notifies Parent in writing at least five (5) Business
Days before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons
therefor and (D) during such five (5) Business Day period, either (1) Parent
does not make a bona fide proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement
or (2) Parent makes a bona fide proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement
that the Company Board considers in good faith, but following which the
Company Board again determines in good faith, after consultation with its
legal advisors and taking into account the terms of such proposal, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the applicable
Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board shall not be
entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless (i) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their Representatives has breached this _Section 5.3_ in any respect
as relates to such Superior Proposal, including with result to any
related Competing Proposal or Competing Inquiry, (ii) the Company has
provided written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and
the Purchaser that the Company intends to take such action, which notice
includes an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action (including the identity of the Third Party making the Superior
Proposal) and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior
Proposal, (iii) during the five (5) Business Days period following Parents
and the Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with

 



-55- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Parent and the Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent and the
Purchaser desire to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) following the end of the five (5)
Business Days period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and the Purchaser in response to the Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
sentence, references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall be deemed
to be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure permitted under  _Section 5.3(g)(i)_ that is
not an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Boards recommendation in favor of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.3_ by any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.3_) by the Company.

 

5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authorities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger and (iii) promptly make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and any other

 applicable securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and (C) any other applicable
Law, if any; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with
each other in all respects in connection with (x) preparing and filing the
Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and any other filings made or required to
be made with the SEC in connection with the Offer or the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, (y) making an appropriate filing pursuant
to the HSR Act as set forth in _Section 5.4(d)_ and determining whether any
other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority
is required, in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or timely
making any such filings. The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing under the rules
and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
give) any notices to Third Parties required to be given by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, and use, and cause the Company Subsidiaries to use,
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Third Party consents
(including consents under any Company Material Contracts), (i) necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, (ii) disclosed or required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or
which could reasonably be expected to result, after the consummation of the
Offer or the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such
consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect
to the Offer or the Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent,
none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
due to such Person and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is

Governmental Authority or any Third Party with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, objection, charge or other Action and (iii) promptly inform the other

and cooperate with the other parties and consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such cooperation shall include
consultation with each other

 where practicable in advance of any meeting or conference with the FTC, the
DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any Action by a
Third Party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person,
providing the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences).

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto agrees to: (i) within ten (10) Business Days of the

Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of

contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act by the FTC or the DOJ and (iii) use

as practicable. Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of
the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated thereby, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Third Party relating
to the Offer, the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable competition
Law, subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.4_. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of
Parent in all material respects in all such negotiations and other discussions
or actions to the extent requested by Parent. The Company shall not make any
offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Authority with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling,
except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. Parent shall bear
all filing fees in connection with any filings made under the HSR Act pursuant
to this _Section 5.4(d)_. None of Parent, the Purchaser or the Company shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or applicable competition Laws,
without the prior written consent of the other parties. If any request for
additional information and documents, including a "second request" under the
HSR Act, is received from any Governmental Authority then the Parties shall
substantially comply with any such request at the earliest practicable date.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
(but subject in all respects to _Section 5.1_), (i) nothing in this _Section
5.4_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE VII_ hereof and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to, or to agree to (and
none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written
consent of Parent): (A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or a
portion of its respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its
business in a specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of
filing fees and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to

5.5 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the

of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the
Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent. Thereafter, none of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall
cause its Representatives and Affiliates, if applicable, not to) issue any
press release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the Company, in the event
the disclosing party is Parent, the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
Representatives or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their Representatives, in each
case, with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if a party determines in good
faith and based upon advice of counsel, that a press release, SEC filing or
public announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations
of any applicable stock exchange, such party may make such press release, SEC
filing or public announcement, in which case the disclosing party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other parties reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance,
(ii) this _Section 5.6_ shall terminate upon an Adverse Recommendation
Change and (iii) each of the parties may make public statements in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any
such statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company
or previously approved by the other party and do not reveal material, non-
public information regarding the other parties, the Offer, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

5.7  _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights of
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor
of past and present directors and officers of the Company as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or under any indemnification, employment
or other similar Contracts set forth on _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule between such past and present directors and officers of
the Company and the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement with 

 



-59- ##### Table of Contents

  

 respect to acts or omissions in their capacity as directors or officers
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
(unless otherwise required by applicable Law). From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to pay and perform in a
timely manner such indemnification obligations in accordance with their
terms. Subject to _Section 5.7(c)_, for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, exculpation, and advancement
of expenses of directors and officers of the Company for periods at or prior
to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension (or "tail") of the directors and
officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each
case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period
of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not pay a premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement, which premium the Company represents and warrants to be as set
forth on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided
further_ , that if the premium for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee, subject to applicable Law (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_).

5.8 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of Parent,
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender
Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company and the Company Board shall take all actions necessary to render such
Takeover Statute inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

5.10 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries (individually, " _Company Employee_ " and collectively, "
_Company Employees_ ") annual base salary or base wages that are
substantially comparable, to the base salary or base wages provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries and benefit
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to either (i) the
benefits provided to Company Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) the benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries.

 

(b) With respect to the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries that are offered to the Company Employees after the
Effective Time (including any Company Employee Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "),
for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or vesting under any
equity incentive plan), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time;  _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Company Employee Plans in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the date that the Purchaser
and the Company become part of the same controlled group pursuant to Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (the " _Controlled Group Date_ "), unless
otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Controlled Group Date, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to effect the termination of any and all Company Employee
Plans intended to qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under
Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that each such 401(k) Plan has been terminated
pursuant to an action by the Company Board.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Company Employee for any reason, or (ii) require
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time.
The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.10_ shall
create such rights in any such Persons.

 

5.11 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall cause the compensation committee of the Company Board to
be, at all times from and after the date of this Agreement until the first
date on which Parents designees constitute a majority of the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 1.3_, composed solely of "independent directors" within
the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent necessary, the Company
Board shall, at a meeting duly called and held, determine that each of the
members of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board is an "independent
director." Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, acting through a
compensation committee of the Company Board or its independent directors,
shall take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each
Company Compensation Arrangement and each Parent Compensation Arrangement
with any of its directors, officers or employees to be approved as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement, and shall take all other action necessary
to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor with respect to
such Company Compensation Arrangements and Parent Compensation Arrangements in
accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that the
Company shall deliver to Parent drafts of all calculations, resolutions,
consents, disclosures and other documents prepared in connection with the
actions required under this _Section 5.11(a)_, and provide ten (10) Business
Days for Parents review and comment on all such calculations, resolutions,
consents, disclosures and other documents (and the Companys acceptance of
Parents reasonable comments shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Compensation
Arrangement_ " means (i) any employment agreement, severance agreement or
change of control agreement between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any holder of Shares who is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, (ii) any
Company Options or Company RSUs awarded to, or any acceleration of vesting of
any Company Options or Company RSUs held by, any holder of Shares who is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and (iii) other Employment Compensation Arrangements entered into or proposed
to be entered into between Parent or any of its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall, from and after the date hereof and
until the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan,
program or Contract pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former
director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the 

 



-62- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company or any Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee (each
member of which the Company Board determined is an "independent director"
within the meaning of Section 803A(2) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide and shall
be an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall
have taken all such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (i) approve as an
Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program or Contract and
(ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program or
Contract; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that

Company for all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the Companys cooperation and
compliance with this _Section 5.17(a)_. Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information used in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.17(a)_ to the contrary, the Company may refuse to provide any
access, or to disclose any information, if the Company is advised in writing
by its outside legal counsel that providing such access or disclosing such
information would (A) violate applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy
laws); provided, that, the Company shall provide such access or disclose such
information to the greatest extent possible without violating applicable Law
or (B) cause the loss of any attorney-client privilege; provided, that, if
any information is withheld pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), the Company
shall inform the Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and

customary joint defense agreement, to enable the Company to provide such
information without causing the loss of any attorney-client privilege. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable Expenses actually
incurred or accrued by Parent and the Purchaser (including reasonable Expenses

will compensate Parent and the Purchaser in the circumstances in which
such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transaction,
each of which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Except in the case of willful and material breach of _Section 5.3_
or _Section 5.4_, the payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement and
Termination Fee, if payable, pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be the

Reimbursement or Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2_.

by the parties hereto.

7.4 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 1.1(c)_, at any time prior to

of the obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive any Uncured
Inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of

the State of New York shall govern any such action.

(c) This  _Section 8.11_, _Section 8.10_, _Section 8.13(c)_ and _Section

8.13  _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Enforcement; Waiver of Trial
by Jury_.

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based
upon, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and
enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without
regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of Laws principles,
whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).

 

(b) Any action, claim, suit or proceeding between the parties hereto arising
out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court therefrom). Each
party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
in respect of any such action, claim, suit or proceeding and agrees that it
will not bring any such action, claim, suit or proceeding in any other court.
Furthermore, each party hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or
proceeding, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with _Section 8.3_, (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the action, claim, suit or proceeding in
such

 



-87- ##### Table of Contents

  

 court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of the action,
claim, suit or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees
that notice or the service of process in any action, claim, suit or proceeding
arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the
manner contemplated by _Section 8.3_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN
ANY WAY RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR
THE DEBT FINANCING CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 

8.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including via facsimile, .pdf or other electronic means), and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

8.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and any such
injunction shall be in addition to any other remedy to which any party is
entitled, at law or in equity. In connection with any action for specific
performance, each party hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for proof of
actual damages or the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
remedies referred to in this _Section 8.15_.
