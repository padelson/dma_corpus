iv _SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

THIS SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July
20, 2012, is made by and among Boomerang Media Holdings II LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Purchaser_ "), and Boomerang Media Holdings I
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
_Article XII_ below.

WHEREAS, the Seller is the record and beneficial owner of 1,000 common units
of the Company (the " _Units_ ");

WHEREAS, the Units represent all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company;

 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to
which the Seller shall sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall
purchase from the Seller, all of the Units;

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
Eric Ellenbogen and John Engelman have executed employment agreements with
respect to their employment with the Company following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
certain Affiliates of the Company have entered into the Limited Guaranty
dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Limited Guaranty_ ") pursuant
to which such Affiliates have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to fund certain Tax-related indemnification obligations set
forth in this Agreement to the extent that insufficient funds are available in
the Escrow Account to fund such obligations.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

_SALE AND PURCHASE OF UNITS_

1.01 _Sale and Purchase of Units_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign,
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser

 



1  at the Closing, and the Purchaser agrees that it shall purchase and accept
delivery from the Seller of all of the Units, which Units shall constitute all
of the outstanding equity securities (and rights to acquire equity
securities) of the Company, free and clear of any Liens.

1.02 _Consideration_. As consideration for the Units, the Purchaser shall pay
to the Seller, in the manner described herein, an amount equal to the Closing
Cash Consideration _plus_ the Additional Consideration (the " _Purchase Price_
").

 

1.03 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser its good
faith estimate of (i) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (the
" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (iii) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Net Working Capital Amount_ ").

1.04 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as possible, but
in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
deliver to the Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the open of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheet
(together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Preliminary Statement_ ").
The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and Cash, Indebtedness and Net
Working Capital shall be determined (including for purposes of _Section
1.03_), on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP using the same
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used
in the preparation of the calculation of Net Working Capital as of February
29, 2012 set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, to the extent not specified on
_Exhibit A_, in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, and shall not
include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties agree that
the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining Cash,
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital and the related purchase price
adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.04_ is to (i) measure the amount
of Cash and Indebtedness and (ii) measure changes in Net Working Capital
against the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining Cash, Indebtedness or Net Working Capital. To the extent
that the calculation of the Net Working Capital corrects an error or
inconsistency or noncompliance with an accounting procedure that was used in
the calculation of the Target Net Working Capital Amount, then the Target Net
Working Capital Amount shall be reduced or increased as a result of such
error, inconsistency or noncompliance, as appropriate, to correct such error,
inconsistency or noncompliance. During the forty-five (45) day period
following the Sellers receipt of the Preliminary Statement and until final
resolution hereunder, the Seller and its accountants and other representatives
shall be permitted reasonable access to review the Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers related to the preparation
of the Preliminary Statement. The Seller and its accountants and other
representatives may make inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company and their
respective 

 



2  accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the
Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the
Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to
cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. At the request of the Seller,
the Company shall permit any person who is employed by the Company or its
Affiliates after the Closing to reasonably assist the Seller in its review of
the Preliminary Statement and any objections or disputes with respect thereto.
If the Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the
Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement (an " _Objections
Statement_ ") that shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted and (B) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on Cash, Indebtedness or Net Working Capital not
being calculated in accordance with this Agreement. If an Objections Statement
is not delivered to the Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after delivery
of the Preliminary Statement to the Seller, the Preliminary Statement shall
be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
submit to Duff and Phelps Corporation or, if Duff and Phelps Corporation is not
available, another independent accounting or valuation firm acceptable to the
Seller and the Purchaser (the " _Valuation Firm_ ") for resolution any and all
matters that remain in dispute and which were properly included in the
Objections Statement. Any further submissions to the Valuation Firm must be
written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The Valuation Firm shall
make a final determination of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital, and
the resulting Final Cash Consideration calculated with reference to such
amounts to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit B_. The
parties will cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its
engagement. The determination of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital as
of the open of business on the Closing Date, and the resulting Final Cash
Consideration calculated with reference thereto, shall become final and
binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final
resolution in writing to the parties.

1.05 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Cash Consideration is
greater than the Closing Cash Consideration, the Purchaser shall promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Final
Cash Consideration is finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.04_) pay to
the Seller the amount of such excess, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller
to the Purchaser. If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing
Cash Consideration, the Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the date on which the Final Cash Consideration is
finally determined pursuant to  _Section 1.04_) cause the Escrow Agent to
pay to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account the amount of such difference by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Purchaser to the Seller. The Seller shall not have any
liability for any amounts due pursuant to _Section 1.04_ or this _Section
1.05_ except to the extent of the funds available in the Escrow Account.

2.01 _The Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the
failure of the Company or the Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
agreement or condition to be complied with or satisfied by the Company or the
Seller pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result

contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,

contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the

be complied with or satisfied by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to result in any

 



31  condition to the obligations of any party to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ or the

representation or warranty, the failure to comply with any other covenant or
agreement, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Person, and (b) if the Purchaser fails to
provide such notice under this _Section 8.02_ in respect of a breach of a

certificate of formation, certification of incorporation,
operating agreement, bylaws, or equivalent governing documents relating to
the exculpation or indemnification (including fee advancement) of any officers
and/or directors in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of such

and/or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing
Date.

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company (at the Purchasers expense) to, purchase a prepaid insurance policy (
_i.e._ , "tail coverage") which policy provides directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for the individuals who are as of the date
hereof (and any additional individuals who prior to the Closing Date become)
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies
in effect on the date hereof (the " _Existing D andO Policies_") on no less
favorable terms (including in amount and scope) than the terms in such
Existing DandO Policies for the benefit of such individuals for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from
acts, events or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to pay a premium for
such "tail coverage" insurance policy in excess of $200,000 (the " _Premium
Cap_ ") (it being understood and agreed that in the event such insurance
policy cannot be obtained for such amount or less, in the aggregate, (i) the
Company, in its sole discretion, may nevertheless, at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, elect for the Purchaser to purchase such
policy, in which case the amount by which the premium for such policy exceeds
the Premium Cap shall be treated as a Transaction Expense or (ii) if the
Company does not so elect, the Purchaser shall remain obligated to provide the
greatest insurance coverage as may be obtained without requiring payments in
excess of the Premium Cap). Such policy shall be from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the insurance carriers party to the
Existing DandO Policies.

 



32 (c) If the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merge into any other Person and will
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) is to transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
8.03_. The provisions of this  _Section 8.03_ are intended for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former officer, director or

and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any individuals who are as of the date hereof
(and any additional individuals who prior to the Closing Date become) covered
by the Companys Existing DandO Policies on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date, the provisions of this  _Section 8.03_ shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

8.04 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. For at least twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, at its
option, either (i) maintain in effect on behalf of each Company Employee who
is employed by the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or
after the Closing Date (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ", but for the
avoidance of doubt, not including Company Employees terminated after the
Closing) employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other
compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and
policies (other than any equity based plans) of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof (the " _Company Plans_ ") or
(ii) provide Continuing Employees with such compensation and benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, agreements and policies (other than equity-based
plans) providing benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
those that are provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall provide the Continuing Employees with
service credit for all purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan) under any compensation or benefit plans,
programs, arrangements, agreements and policies sponsored by the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, except to the extent duplication of benefits would
result. To the extent that the Purchaser modifies any welfare benefit coverage
or plan under which the Continuing Employees participate, the Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive any applicable waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions or actively at work requirements, to the
extent such waiting periods, pre-existing conditions and requirements would
have been waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Plans in which
the Continuing Employees were eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Closing, and (B) give such employees credit under the new coverages or
benefit plans for deductibles, co insurance and out of pocket payments that
have been paid during the year in which such welfare benefit coverage or plan
modification occurs. The Company shall be solely responsible for any
obligations arising under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9) who are current or former employees or other eligible service

Closing, the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties
hereto, any right to enforce the provisions of this  _Section 8.04_ as a
third-party beneficiary, or any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever and no provision of this _Section 8.04_ is intended to be or shall
constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Company, the
Purchaser or any respective Subsidiary thereof. Nothing in this _Section
8.04_ shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action
that would have the effect of requiring, Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue any specific plans or to continue the employment of
any specific person.

 

8.05 _Regulatory Filings_. The Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof (and in any event within seven (7)

of the Purchaser under the HSR Act or any other material applicable antitrust
or noncompetition Laws or regulations (" _Antitrust Laws_ ") or other Laws
applicable to the Purchaser for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. The Purchaser shall promptly comply with any additional
requests for information by any Governmental Entities, including requests for

additional information, or any communications with any Governmental Entities
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser
shall diligently assist and cooperate with the Company and the Seller in
preparing and filing all documents required to be submitted by the Seller, the
Company or its Affiliates to any Governmental Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and in obtaining any Governmental Entity or
third-party consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals that may be
required to be obtained by the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and
cooperation shall include timely furnishing to the Company or the Seller all
information concerning the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates that counsel to
the Company and/or the Seller reasonably determines is required to be
included in such documents or would be helpful in obtaining such required
consent, waiver, authorization or approval); _provided_ that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not have any obligation to provide any
information the disclosure of which is prohibited under applicable Law or is
subject to the attorneyclient privilege. The Purchaser shall be responsible
for all filing fees under the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws and all other
Laws or regulations applicable to the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall cause the
filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination".

 

8.06 _Conditions_. The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 3.02_ to be satisfied and to

communicate with the employees,

 



34  customers, service providers and suppliers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby after

ARTICLE IX

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

9.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants, Agreements and Other
Provisions_. Except to the extent a different period is expressly set forth
herein, the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other
provisions in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on
March 31, 2014; _provided_ that (i) the representations and warranties of the
Seller and the Company set forth in  _Section 4.08_ and (ii) the covenants
and agreements of the Seller set forth in _Section 11.03(j)_ and _Section
11.03(k)_ shall survive the Closing Date until the expiration of the relevant
statute of limitations. No claim for indemnification hereunder for breach of
any such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and other
provisions may be made after the expiration of such survival period;
_provided_ that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
would otherwise terminate in accordance with the preceding sentence will
continue to survive if a written notice of such breach shall have been timely
given on or prior to such termination date until the related claim
for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved in accordance
with this _Article IX_, but only with respect to matters reasonably described
in such notice.

9.02 _Indemnification from the Escrow Account for the Benefit of the
Purchaser_.

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
IX_ and the Escrow Agreement), the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Purchaser and any of its Affiliates and/or Representatives (each, a "
_Purchaser Indemnitee_ ") harmless from any loss, liability, obligation,
damage, claim of any kind, interest, cost or expense (including reasonable
attorney fees and expenses and other costs or expenses incurred in the
collection of any judgments with respect to actions, proceedings or claims)
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by a Purchaser Indemnitee as
a result of or arising from any nonfulfillment, inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision set forth
herein by the Company or the Seller or in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder (excluding in all cases any nonfulfillment, inaccuracy
or breach of the Company or its Subsidiaries that occurs after the Closing)
(determined without regard to any qualifications therein referencing
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" (other than in  _Section
4.06(a)_)); _provided_ that no indemnification shall be available under this
_Section 9.02(a)_ with respect to the unavailability of any net operating
loss, tax basis or other tax asset as of the Closing Date except to the
extent that such unavailability results in a Tax liability for a taxable
period or portion thereof on or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 9.02(a)_,
no claims by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be so asserted pursuant to this
_Section 9.02(a)_ in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be
payable under this  _Section 9.02(a)_ in respect of all breaches of
representations and warranties

 



35  exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,550,000 (the "
_Purchaser Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Purchaser Deductible. In addition, subject to the penultimate sentence of
this _Section 9.02(a)_, (i) no individual claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee
pursuant to this _Section 9.02(a)_ shall be so asserted unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant to such claim and
any related claims exceeds an amount equal to $25,000 (the " _Purchaser Mini-
Basket_ ") (it being understood that any such individual claims for amounts
less than the Purchaser Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in determining
whether the Purchaser Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter), and (ii)
in no event shall a Purchaser Indemnitee be entitled to recover or make a
claim for, and in no event shall Losses include, any amounts in respect of
consequential, special or indirect damages or punitive damages, and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses,
except, in each case, for any damages that shall be payable as a result of, or
any such valuation methodology used with respect to, a Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 9.02(a)_ as a result of or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy
of a Specified Representation (or, for the avoidance of doubt, under _Section
11.03_) shall be subject to the Purchaser Deductible or the Purchaser Mini-
Basket. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall be entitled to enforce
the provisions of this _Article IX_ on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for,
each Purchaser Indemnitee, but the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be third
party beneficiaries hereof.

(b) Any indemnification owed by the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnitees
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ shall be satisfied first from the funds then
remaining in the Escrow Account. Except with respect to any indemnification
obligation of the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.02(a) _as a result of or
arising from any nonfulfillment, inaccuracy or breach by the Company or the
Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision
contained in _Section 4.08_ or _Section 11.03_ and except in the case of
fraud, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under
_Section 9.02(a)_ more than the amount of the funds then available in the
Escrow Account (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
Purchaser shall have direct recourse to the Seller at any time in which there
are insufficient funds remaining in the Escrow Account (net of amounts
reserved for pending claims) to satisfy any indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_ as a result of or arising from any
nonfulfillment, inaccuracy or breach of _Section 4.08_ or _Section 11.03_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers aggregate liability for
indemnification (i) pursuant to  _Section 9.02(a)_ as a result of or arising
from any nonfulfillment, inaccuracy or breach by the Company or the Seller of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision contained
in _Section 4.08_ or  _Section 11.03_ (other than _Section 11.03(a)_) and
(ii) pursuant to _Section 11.03(a)_, including any amounts paid from the
Escrow Account in respect of such indemnification obligations, shall in no
event exceed $50,000,000 (the " _Tax Cap_ ").

(c) Except to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty and except in
the case of fraud, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IX_ and of _Section 11.03_ and the remedies contemplated by
_Section 13.19_ shall constitute a Purchaser Indemnitees sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or
arising from this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder. The Purchaser agrees that other than as

 



36  contemplated by the previous sentence, under no circumstances will the
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors,
partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") have any liability
to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Parties_ ") relating to
or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate
delivered hereunder.

(d) Other than as expressly contemplated in this Agreement or in the Limited
Guaranty and except in the case of fraud, none of the Purchaser or the other
Purchaser Parties may avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this
_Article IX_ by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to
any other theory of liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall have no right to
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the
extent such Loss or alleged Loss is included in the Transaction Expenses paid
at Closing or the calculation of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or
Change of Control Payments.

(e) All payments made from the Escrow Account, pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_,
pursuant to _Section 11.03_ or pursuant to the Limited Guaranty shall be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(f) (i) Except for the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ and except
as expressly set forth in the Escrow Agreement, no Person (including any
Seller Party) shall have any obligation to fund the Escrow Account and (ii)
title and all rights to funds in the Escrow Account shall be transferred to
the Seller on the dates specified in the Escrow Agreement.

(g) Except with respect to indemnification payable from the Escrow Account,
any indemnification payable by the Seller to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to this _Section 9.02_ shall be delivered to the Purchaser by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Purchasers account within fifteen (15)
days after the final determination thereof.

9.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Seller_.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller or
any of its Affiliates and/or Representatives (each, a " _Seller Indemnitee_
") and hold them harmless against any Losses which such Seller Indemnitee may
suffer or sustain as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser under this Agreement or (ii) any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or other provision set
forth herein by the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim by a
Seller Indemnitee shall be so asserted pursuant to this _Section 9.03(a)_ in
respect of a breach of any representation or warranty unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under this _Section
9.03(a)_ in respect of all such breaches of representations and warranties
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $1,550,000 (the " _Seller
Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Seller
Deductible. In addition, (A) no individual claim by a Seller Indemnitee shall
be so asserted pursuant to this _Section 9.03(a)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant

 



37  to such claim and any related claims exceeds an amount equal to $25,000 (the
" _Seller Mini-Basket_ ") (it being understood that any such individual claims
for amounts less than the Seller Mini-Basket shall be disregarded in
determining whether the Seller Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter)
and (B) in no event shall a Seller Indemnitee be entitled to recover or make a
claim for, and in no event shall Losses include, any amounts in respect of
consequential, special or indirect damages or punitive damages, and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses,
except, in each case, for any damages that shall be payable as a result of, or
any such valuation methodology used with respect to, a Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(a)_ as a result of or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy
of _Section 6.06_ shall be subject to the Seller Deductible or the Seller
Mini-Basket. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions of this _Article IX_ on behalf of, and as attorney-in-
fact for, each Seller Indemnitee, but the Seller Indemnitees shall not be
third party beneficiaries hereof.

 

(b) Any indemnification payable to a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to this
_Section 9.03_ shall be delivered to the Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Sellers account within fifteen (15) days
after the final determination thereof.

(c) Except in cases of fraud, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article IX_ and the remedies contemplated by _Section 13.19_
constitute a Seller Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including in any
Exhibit, Schedule or certificate delivered hereunder.

9.04 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take all reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any
event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith; _provided_
that such failure to mitigate Losses in accordance with the foregoing shall
not relieve the Seller or the Purchaser of its indemnification obligations
under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that any Losses were directly
the result of such failure to mitigate.

 

9.05 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under _Sections 9.02_ or _9.03_  (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall
notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ "), if applicable, of the
claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of any action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by a third
party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable)
and the basis thereof; _provided_ that the failure of an Indemnitee to so
notify shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnitor is actually
prejudiced thereby. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim by a
Person who is not a party hereto or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such
Indemnitors expense, and, at its option, shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice to assume control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee and at the expense of the Indemnitor, of

 



38  the defense thereof; _provided_ that (i) any Indemnitor shall continue to be
entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained herein and (ii) the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate (but not control or make
decisions related thereto) in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel
of its choice for such purpose at the Indemnitees expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any assumption and control of the defense of any claim by an
Indemnitor pursuant to this _Section 9.05_ shall occur only if (i) the Third
Party Claim involves primarily a claim for monetary damages and any claim for
an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than
monetary damages against the Indemnitee as part of such claim is only
incidental to such claim for monetary damages ( _provided_ that if the Third
Party Claim seeks more than an incidental order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than monetary damages against the
Indemnitee that the Indemnitor reasonably determines, after conferring with
its outside counsel, can be readily separated from any related claim for
monetary damages, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the control of
the defense of the portion relating to monetary damages), (ii) the Indemnitor
acknowledges in writing its irrevocable and unconditional obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article IX_) and (iii) there is a reasonable probability that the
Indemnitor shall, after giving effect to the Purchaser Mini-Basket, the
Purchaser Deductible and the Tax Cap or the Seller Mini-Basket and the Seller
Deductible, as applicable, and the other provisions of this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated hereby (including the Escrow Agreement and the
Limited Guaranty), bear in excess of 50% of the Losses with respect to such
claim. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; _provided_ that the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim
if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim without prejudice,
except for payments that would be required to be paid representing the
Purchaser Mini-Basket and the Purchaser Deductible or the Seller Mini-Basket
and the Seller Deductible, as applicable. So long as the Indemnitor is
reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall not
pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim if it
waives any right to indemnity therefor under this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, (x) the Purchaser shall be entitled to provide any notices required
to be delivered by a Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder or to participate in the
defense of a Third Party Claim to which a Purchaser Indemnitee is a party, in
each case on behalf (and in satisfaction of the obligations) of such
Purchaser Indemnitee, and (y) the Seller shall be entitled to provide any
notices required to be delivered by a Seller Indemnitee hereunder or to
participate in the defense of a Third Party Claim to which a Seller
Indemnitee is a party, in each case on behalf (and in satisfaction of the
obligations) of such Seller Indemnitee.

9.06 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 9.02_ or _9.03_ shall be calculated net of (i)
any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates on account of
such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment recovered by the Indemnitee from any third party with
respect thereto; _provided_ that the amount deemed to be so recovered under
any insurance policy shall be net of (i) the applicable deductible for such
policies and (ii) any

 



39  increase in the premium for such policies directly attributable to such
Losses. If a Purchaser Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit after an
indemnification payment is made to it, such Purchaser Indemnitee shall
promptly pay to the Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or
times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized by the
Indemnitee. For purposes of this _Section 9.06_, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall
mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes that
otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the highest marginal
tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The Indemnitee shall
seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same
extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.
In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee
with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by such
Indemnitee in procuring such recovery) shall be made promptly to the
Indemnitor; _provided_ that (a) any such refund shall not be in excess of the
amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Indemnitee by the Indemnitor
in respect of such matter, and (b) prior to the termination of the
Escrow Account, any such amount recovered by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be
deposited into the Escrow Account to fund the indemnification obligations
under _Section 9.02(a)_ (rather than be paid over to the Seller) if the
amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Indemnitee by the
Indemnitor in respect of such matters was funded out of the Escrow Account.
Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses.

9.07 _Acknowledgment of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser acknowledges that it
has conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Purchaser has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedules attached hereto. Such representations and warranties by
the Company or the Seller, as applicable, constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company or the Seller, as applicable,
to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied
(including any relating to the future or historical financial condition,
results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company, or the quality,
quantity or condition of the Companys or its Subsidiaries assets)
are specifically disclaimed by the Company and the Seller. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, none of the Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries makes or provides, and the Purchaser hereby waives, any warranty
or representation, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, conformity to samples, or condition of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries assets or any part thereof. In connection with
the Purchasers investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Purchaser has received certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. The Purchaser
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is
familiar with such uncertainties and that the Purchaser is making its own
evaluation of the

 



40  adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, the
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that none of the Seller Parties is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts, and that the Purchaser
is only relying on the representations and warranties expressly and
specifically set forth in this Agreement. The Purchaser further agrees, for
itself and the other Purchaser Parties, that none of the Seller Parties or
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to any Purchaser
Party or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser or
any other Purchaser Party, or the Purchasers use of, any such information,
including any information, document or material made available to the
Purchaser or any other Purchaser Party in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 _TERMINATION_

10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

(b) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if any judgment, decree or order of any
Governmental Entity that would prevent the performance of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, declare unlawful the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or cause such transactions to be
rescinded shall have become final and nonappealable;

(c) by the Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by the Company
or the Seller of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement that has prevented (or, if incapable of being cured, would
prevent) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in _Section 3.01_ and
such violation or breach has not been waived by the Purchaser or cured by the
Company or the Seller within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach from the Purchaser;

(d) by the Seller, if there has been a violation or breach by the Purchaser of
any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement that has prevented (or, if incapable of being cured, would prevent)
the satisfaction of any condition set forth in _Section 3.02_ and such
violation or breach has not been waived by the Seller or cured by the
Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of
written notice of such breach from the Seller (provided that none of (i) a
breach by the Purchaser of _Section 6.08_ hereof or (ii) the failure to
deliver the Closing Cash Consideration or the other payments contemplated by
_Section 2.02_ at the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject to cure
hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Seller); or

 



41 (e) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby
have not been consummated on or before October 20, 2012 (such date, the "
_Outside Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or prior to such date is the result of a material
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (e).

10.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Purchaser or the Seller as provided in _Section 10.01_, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this  _Section 10.02_, _Article XII_ and
_Article XIII_ hereof, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of the Purchaser, the
Company or the Seller to one another, except for willful breaches of this
Agreement prior to the time of such termination.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

11.01 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein shall be
deemed to refer to this entire Agreement.

11.02 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties hereto that each of the Company, the Seller, its Subsidiaries
and GTCR LLC have retained KandE to act as its counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that KandE has not acted as counsel for
any other party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of KandE
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The
Purchaser, the Company and the Seller hereby agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between the Purchaser, the Company, and/or
its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller, GTCR LLC or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, KandE may represent the Seller,
GTCR LLC and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of
the Seller, GTCR LLC and/or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to the
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related
to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries. The Purchaser further agrees that, as
to all communications among KandE, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Seller,
GTCR LLC and/or any of their respective Affiliates that relate in any way to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorneyclient
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and
may be controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to
this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorneyclient privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by KandE to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller and GTCR
LLC.

 



42 11.03 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) any and
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary
group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of
any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local, or foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or
successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which
Taxes are imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of an
event or transaction occurring prior to the Closing, (iv) all Taxes of the
Seller or any Affiliates of the Seller (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) that are actually incurred by the Company, any Subsidiaries of
the Company, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser for any Tax
period, (v) all costs and expenses relating to the preparation and filing of
(A) any Purchaser-prepared Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
that are required to be filed after the Closing, (B) any EC Sales List returns
that the Seller failed to timely file prior to Closing pursuant to _Section
11.03(i)_ and (C) an election under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(6), a request for relief under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
301.9100-3 pursuant to  _Section 11.03(e)(ii)_ and any amendment of a Tax
Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is required as a result of
any such election or request for relief and (vi) the Sellers portion of the
Taxes described in  _Section 11.03(f)_; _provided_ that no indemnification
shall be available under this _Section 11.03_ or under _Article IX_ hereof
with respect to (x) the unavailability of any net operating loss, tax basis
or other tax asset as of the Closing Date except to the extent that such
unavailability results in a Tax liability for a taxable period or portion
thereof on or prior to the Closing Date or (y) Taxes resulting from an
election pursuant to  _Section 11.03(b)_. In the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the
portion of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (I)
in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales, use or withholding
Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Tax period, and (II) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income
and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time). For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this _Section 11.03(a)_
on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for, each of its Affiliates, but such
Affiliates shall not be third party beneficiaries hereof.

 



43 (b) The Purchaser, the Company or any of their Affiliates may make any
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision under state,
local or foreign law) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) The Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the Company that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part
of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

(d) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be filed (i) all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing that
are required to be filed before the Closing (taking into account any
extensions) and (ii) all Tax Returns for Boomerang Media Holdings II, LLC,
Boomerang Media Holdings III, LLC, GTCR/Boomerang Holdings/B Corp., and, for
the avoidance of doubt, GTCR/Boomerang Holdings/B LP, Boomerang Media Global
Holdings, LLC, Boomerang Media Holdings, LLC, Classic Media Holdings ER, LLC,
Boomerang Media, Inc. and any other entity that will be dissolved in
connection with the restructuring steps described in _Exhibit E_ for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
regardless of when such Tax Returns are required to be filed. Each such Tax
Return shall be prepared and timely filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and in a manner that does not distort taxable income (e.g., by
deferring income or accelerating deductions), except as otherwise required by
a change in applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which each such Tax Return is required to be filed, the Seller shall submit
any such Tax Return to the Purchaser for the Purchasers review and comment,
and the Seller shall accept any reasonable comments provided by
the Purchaser. The Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing that are required to be filed
after the Closing. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice and in a manner that does not distort taxable
income ( _e.g._ , by deferring income or accelerating deductions), except as
otherwise required by a change in applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is required to be filed, the
Purchaser shall submit any such Tax Return to the Seller for the Sellers
review and comment, and the Purchaser shall accept any reasonable comments
provided by the Seller. The Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed
such Tax Returns. The Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, at least five (5)
Business Days before any such Tax Return is due, all Taxes due pursuant to
_Section 11.03(a)_ with respect to the taxable periods covered by such Tax
Returns. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods including, but not ending on, the Closing Date the due date of
which (including extensions) is after the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return
shall be prepared and timely filed in a manner consistent with past practice
and in a manner that does not distort taxable income ( _e.g._ , by deferring
income or accelerating deductions), except as otherwise required by a change
in applicable Law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which each
such Tax Return is required to be filed, the Purchaser shall submit such Tax
Return to the Seller for the Sellers review and comment, and the Purchaser
shall accept any reasonable comments provided by the Seller. No Tax Return
described in this _Section 11.03(d)_ relating to a Pre-Closing Period shall
be filed without the written consent of the

 



44  Seller, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, at least five (5) Business
Days before any such Tax Return is due, all Taxes due pursuant to _Section
11.03(a)_ with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods covered by such Tax Returns.

(e) (i) Without the prior written consent of the Seller, the Purchaser will
not (A) except for Tax Returns that are filed in accordance with _Section
11.03(d)_, file or amend or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to file or
amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) with respect
to Tax Returns filed pursuant to _Section 11.03(d)_, after the date such Tax
Returns are filed pursuant to _Section 11.03(d)_, amend or permit any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend any such Tax Return or (C) extend or
waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period
for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall waive any carryback of
any net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any such Tax Return.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller agrees that
it shall (A) upon the Purchasers written request, (x) enforce its right
under _Section 1(b)_ of the Agreement dated March 30, 2009 between ER North
America Holdings, Inc. and Classic Media Holdings ER, LLC (the " _Side Letter_
") to require ER North America Holdings, Inc. to perform its obligation to
request relief under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 301.9100-3 to file an
election under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reduce its
tax basis in the stock of Entertainment Rights US Holdings Inc., for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, to the amount paid to Entertainment Rights
Overseas Holdings Limited pursuant to the Agreement dated April 1, 2009 by and
among Entertainment Rights PLC (in Administration), Entertainment Rights
Overseas Holdings Limited (in Administration), Nicholas Guy Edwards and
Carlton Malcom Siddle, Classic Media UK Limited and Classic Media Holdings ER,
LLC or (y) assign any and all of its rights under the Side Letter to
the Purchaser or a designated Affiliate of Purchaser and (B) cooperate in
full with the Purchaser in the preparation and filing of any such election or
request for relief and amendment of a Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is required as a result of any such election or request for
relief (including by delivering written consent to any such amended Tax
Return).

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed on the Company or the Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes shall be
borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser
agree to cooperate with each other in the filing of any returns with respect
to the Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying any information in
either of their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns. 

(g) The Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds or credits actually
applied in a Pre-Closing Tax Period as of the Closing Date that are received
by the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to Taxes paid
by the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (or portion thereof) (including any Tax refunds 

 



45  attributable to the carryback of any such items), and the Purchaser shall
pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit within
five (5) days after actual receipt of such refund or credit against Taxes.
After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller in seeking
any Tax refunds or credit to which the Seller would be entitled under this
_Section 11.03(g)_ and shall take any action reasonably requested by the
Seller to secure any such Tax refunds or credits.

(h) Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar agreements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the
Company other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be
terminated and all payables and receivables arising thereunder shall
be settled, in each case prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights
or liabilities thereunder or under any payables or receivables arising
thereunder.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to file all EC Sales List returns that are required to be filed in order to
comply with current HMRC Regulations and shall pay all Taxes required to be
shown as due on such EC Sales List returns.

(j) The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding or any tax planning, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
materials provided hereunder.

 

(k) Promptly after the Purchaser becomes aware of the existence of a Tax issue
that may give rise to an indemnification claim under  _Section 11.03(a)_ (a
" _Tax Controversy_ ") by it against the Seller, the Purchaser shall notify
the Seller of the Tax issue, and thereafter shall promptly forward to the
Seller copies of notices and communications with a Governmental Entity
relating to such Tax issue. The Seller shall have the responsibility for, and
the right to control, at the Sellers expense, the audit of any Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to a taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Purchaser
and the Company will have the right, directly or through its designated
representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all submissions
made in the course of audits of such Tax Returns (including any
administrative appeals thereof) and (ii) the Seller shall not settle any Tax
proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy on a basis that would adversely
affect the Purchaser without obtaining the Purchasers written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall have the responsibility for, and jointly control, each
at their own expense, the audit of any Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to a taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree on
an audit they jointly control, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit
any disputes to an independent accounting firm acceptable to the Seller and
the Purchaser (an " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. The Accounting Firm
shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on information provided
by the Seller and the Purchaser,

 



46  and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute with respect to
any such audit. The decision of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding
and shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any disputes
arising with respect to audits which the parties jointly control. Each party
shall pay one-half of the Accounting Firms fees, costs and expenses. With
respect to all other Tax Returns, the Purchaser and the Company will have the
responsibility for, and the right to control the audit of, such Tax Returns.

(l) Any indemnity payment to be made under this _Section 11.03_ shall be
paid within ten (10) days after the Purchaser makes written demand upon the
Seller, but in no case earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the date
on which the relevant Taxes (including any estimated Tax payments) are
required to be paid to the relevant Governmental Entity. For so long as there
are sufficient funds remaining in the Escrow Account (net of amounts reserved
for pending claims) to satisfy any indemnification obligation owed by the
Seller to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to _Section
11.03(a)_, any such obligations shall be satisfied first from the funds then
remaining in the Escrow Account (net of amounts reserved for pending claims),
it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Purchaser shall have
direct recourse to the Seller at such time as there are insufficient funds
remaining in the Escrow Account to satisfy any such indemnification obligation
(after deducting amounts reserved for pending claims); _provided_ that the
Sellers aggregate liability for indemnification (i) pursuant to _Section
9.02(a) _as a result of or arising from any nonfulfillment, inaccuracy or
breach by the Company or the Seller of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other provision contained in _Section 4.08_ or
_Section 11.03_ (other than _Section 11.03(a)_) and (ii) pursuant to 
_Section 11.03(a)_, including any amounts paid from the Escrow Account in
respect of such indemnification obligations, shall in no event exceed the Tax
Cap.

(m) The indemnification provisions in this _Section 11.03_ shall survive
until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. If written notice of a claim has been given in accordance with
this _Section 11.03_ prior to the expiration of such indemnification
provisions, then such indemnification provisions shall survive as to such
claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

 

(n) At least seven (7) calendar days prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall
provide to the Seller a proposal with respect to the amount of the total
consideration (including liabilities assumed in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) allocated to
the shares of Classic Media UK Limited that are owned and distributed
by GTCR/Boomerang Holdings/B Corp. as described in _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Proposed Allocation_ "). If the Seller does not agree with the Proposed
Allocation, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
to agree upon an allocation with respect to such shares prior to the Closing.
If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree upon an allocation of the total
consideration prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit,
within five (5) Business Days after the Closing, any dispute with respect to
the proper allocation of the total consideration to an independent accounting
or valuation firm reasonably acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser (the "
_Tax Valuation Firm_ ") for resolution of any matters that remain in dispute.
Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to (i) cooperate with the Tax
Valuation Firm during the term of such firms engagement and (ii) pay one-half
of such firms fees and expenses. The Tax Valuation Firm shall make a

 



47  final determination with respect to the allocation of the total
consideration within thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing, and each of
the Purchaser and the Seller agrees to be bound by such allocation for all
Tax purposes.

13.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by the Purchaser without the prior written consent of
the Company and the Seller.

13.06 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

13.07 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference

 



57  to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be
deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or
a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given
to them in this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
"including" or any variation thereof means "including, without limitation"
and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to
the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. Unless the
context otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term used in this Agreement
shall have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

13.08 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any
information set forth in any Schedule referenced in a particular Section of
this Agreement shall be considered to have been set forth in each other
Schedule and shall be deemed to modify the representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ of this Agreement whether or not such representations and
warranties refer to such Schedule if the relevance of such disclosure to such
other representations and warranties is reasonably apparent on its face. In
the event a subject matter is addressed in more than one representation and
warranty in  _Article IV_, the Purchaser shall be entitled to rely only on
the most specific representation and warranty addressing such matter. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits does not constitute an admission or determination that
such dollar amount or item (i) is indicative of what is or is not material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) establishes a standard of materiality
or (iii) is within or outside the Ordinary Course of Business. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of
Law or breach of contract). For purposes of this Agreement, if the Company or
a Person acting on its behalf posts, prior to 11:05 p.m. CDT on the date
hereof, a document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and
located at the website of Intralinks, Inc. under the name "Project Casper"
and to which the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives have had
access, such document shall be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished" or
"made available" (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the
Company.

13.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a
writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect
in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default. No
failure or delay on the part of any party to this Agreement in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any waiver on the part of any party to this Agreement of any right,
power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

 



58 13.10 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits) and the documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Limited Guaranty) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

13.11  _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. _Section 8.03_ shall be enforceable by
the current and former officers, directors and similar functionaries of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under
or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

13.12 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ESCROW AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO
THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

13.13 _Purchaser Deliveries_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all
documents or other items delivered or made available to the Purchasers
Representatives shall be deemed to be delivered or made available, as the case
may be, to the Purchaser for all purposes hereunder.

13.14 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a

 



59  facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

 

13.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

13.16  _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

13.17 _Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
(including  _Section 1.04_), any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the
Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action
or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in _Section 13.04_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

13.18 _No Recourse_. Except to the extent set forth in the Limited Guaranty
and except in the case of fraud, the parties to this Agreement agree on their
own behalf and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that
no Non-Recourse Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
except to the extent agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party.

13.19 _Specific Performance_. 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and
affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money
damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also
by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security).

 



60 (b) To the extent any party hereto brings any action, claim, complaint or
other proceeding, in each case, before any Governmental Entity to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
prior to the Closing, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i)
the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint or other
proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action, claim, complaint
or other proceeding.
