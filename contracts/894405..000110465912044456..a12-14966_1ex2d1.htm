NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows.

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1**

 

 ** _PURCHASE AND SALE_**

 



 

1.01 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions in this
Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees (or shall cause any Subsidiary
to which Buyer has assigned its right hereunder) to purchase and acquire from
Sellers, and each Seller hereby agrees to sell, assign, transfer and convey to
Buyer (or any Subsidiary to which Buyer has assigned such right), all of the
Company Stock free and clear of all Liens other than transfer restrictions
arising under federal and state securities laws. In furtherance thereof, at
the Closing:

 



 

(a) Buyer will:

 



 

(i) make payment to the Sellers Representative of an amount equal to the
Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration, as provided by the Sellers
Representative in accordance with _Section 1.02(b)_ , by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Sellers
Representative, for distribution by the Sellers Representative to (A) Sellers
who own preferred stock of the Company (which Sellers are set forth on
_Schedule 1.01(a)(i)(A)_ ) in proportion to their interests in preferred stock
as reflected on _Schedule 3.04_ , and (B) Sellers who own common stock of the
Company (which Sellers are set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)(i)(B)_ ) at the rate
of $100 for each holder of such common stock;

 



 

(ii) deposit $22,500,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ")
established pursuant to an escrow agreement in substantially the form of
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") among Buyer, the
Sellers Representative, and the Escrow Agent;

 



 

(iii) pay, on behalf of the Company, the Indebtedness, as reported by Sellers
Representative in accordance with _Section 1.02(b)_ , by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated by the holders of such
Indebtedness;

 



 

(iv) make payments to (A) the Company, for the benefit of the Option Holders
set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)(iv)(A)_ holding stock options, and (B) to the
Option Holders set forth on _Schedule 1.01(a)(iv)(B)_ who hold warrants and,
in each case in consideration of the cancellation of the Options held by them
(" _Option Holder Payments_ ") in the amount of $100 for each such Option
Holder (excluding from such payment under this subsection (iv) any Option
Holder who also is an owner of the Companys common stock), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Option Holders
who hold warrants; and

 



 

(v) make payments to the Company, for the benefit of participants in the
Companys Cash Incentive Plan and to employees under other transaction
incentive payments (the " _CIP Participants_ ") as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to
$3,900,000, for distribution by the Company, subject to applicable withholding
in the case of employees of the Company, to the persons and in the amounts set
forth in the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company dated June
11, 2012 (" _Transaction Payments_ ").

 



 

(b) Sellers will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer all of the
Company Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

1.02 _Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Aggregate Closing Consideration_ "
means an amount equal to the result of: (i) $180,000,000, _minus_ (ii) the
Escrow Amount, _minus_ (iii) the actual outstanding amount of Indebtedness as
of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, _minus_ (iv) the actual Option Holder
Payments, _minus_ (v) the actual Transaction Payments, _plus_ (vi) the amount,
if any, by which actual Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date exceeds the Net Working Capital Target, or _minus_ (vii) the amount, if
any, by which actual Net Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date
is less than the Net Working Capital Target, _plus_ (viii) the actual amount
of any Cash on Hand as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, when calculating the
Aggregate Closing Consideration, Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration and
Final Aggregate Closing Consideration the calculations shall be performed as
if the Closing had not occurred which, among other things, means (A) the
actual amount of Indebtedness and Cash on Hand as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date shall be calculated as if the Closing had not occurred and any payments
required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, including, the payments made
by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)(iii)_ , had not occurred; _provided_
, _however_ , that any Transaction Expenses which arise as a result of the
Closing shall still be considered in calculating the outstanding amount of
Indebtedness; and (B) the calculation of actual Net Working Capital as of
11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date shall be calculated as if the Closing had not
occurred and any payments required to be made pursuant to this Agreement had
not occurred.

 



 

(b) Two Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers Representative will deliver
to Buyer in writing its estimate of the Aggregate Closing Consideration (such
amount, the " _Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration_ "), which estimate
will be prepared by Sellers Representative in good faith based upon the books
and records of Sellers and the Company and shall include an estimate of: (i)
the total amount of each component item of Indebtedness (including each
component item of Transaction Expenses) and total Indebtedness as of 11:59
p.m. on the Closing Date (together with the name of and wire transfer
instructions for each payee thereof), (ii) the amount of estimated Net Working
Capital as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, and (iii) the total amount of
Cash on Hand as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers
Representative a statement setting forth Buyers proposed calculation of the
actual Aggregate Closing Consideration with a comparison to the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration, including Buyers calculation of each of the
components thereof in sufficient detail to identify each item of difference
between the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration and the Aggregate
Closing Consideration, including details regarding each component item of
Indebtedness (including each component item of Transaction Expenses) (the
_"Closing Statement_ ").

 



 

(d) Following receipt by Sellers Representative of Buyers proposed Closing
Statement and until the Aggregate Closing Consideration is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 1.02_ , Sellers Representative shall be permitted,
upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours) to
review the Companys books and records and working papers related to Buyers
draft of the proposed Closing Statement and determination of the Aggregate
Closing Consideration (and the components thereof), and Buyer shall provide
Sellers Representative with reasonable access to the Companys personnel,
books and records, and facilities in connection with such review. The proposed
Closing Statement delivered by Buyer shall become final and binding on the
parties 30 days following Buyers delivery thereof to Sellers Representative
unless Sellers Representative delivers written notice of its disagreement ("
_Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer on or prior to such date. The Notice of
Disagreement must identify with specificity each item in the Closing Statement
that the Sellers Representative disagrees with and, for each disputed item,
contain a statement describing in reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

detail the basis of such objection and the amount in dispute. If a timely
Notice of Disagreement is delivered by Sellers Representative, then the
Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the parties to this
Agreement on the earlier of (i) the date Buyer and Sellers Representative
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in
dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Accountants.

 



 

(e) During the 30 days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Buyer
and Sellers Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30 day period, Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall submit such dispute to the Independent Accountants for
resolution of all matters which remain in dispute which were included in the
Notice of Disagreement (and shall take all actions reasonably requested by the
Independent Accountants in connection with such resolution, including
submitting written claims to the Independent Accountants if so requested), and
the Independent Accountants shall make a final determination of the Aggregate
Closing Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (with it
being understood that Buyer and the Sellers Representative will request that
the Independent Accountants deliver to Buyer and the Sellers Representative
its resolution in writing not more than 30 days after its engagement). The
Independent Accountants shall make a determination only with respect to the
matters still in dispute and, with respect to each such matter, their
determination shall be within the range of the dispute between Buyer and
Sellers Representative. The Independent Accountants determination shall be
based solely on written materials submitted by Buyer and Sellers
Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions of "
_Aggregate Closing Consideration_ ," " _Indebtedness_ ," " _Cash on Hand_ "
and " _Net Working Capital_ " (and related definitions) included herein and
the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated
between Buyer and Sellers based upon the percentage of the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to Buyer or Sellers bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if Sellers Representative claims the
Aggregate Closing Consideration is $1,000 greater than the amount claimed by
Buyer, and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Sellers
Representative, and if the Independent Accountants ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Sellers $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountants will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷
500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Sellers.

 



 

(g) If the Aggregate Closing Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.02_ (the " _Final Aggregate Closing Consideration_ ") is
greater than the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration (the amount of such
difference being the " _Underpayment_ "), then, within three (3) Business Days
after the date on which the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is
determined, (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers Representative, or cause the
Company to pay to Sellers Representative, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts specified by Sellers Representative
(for distribution to Sellers), an amount equal to the Underpayment, and (ii)
Buyer and Sellers Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Sellers Representative
(for distribution to Sellers) the amount required to be distributed under
_Section 5.04(a)_ from the Escrow Account.

 



 

(h) If the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration (the amount of such difference being the "
_Overpayment_ "), then, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which
the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is determined, Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the Overpayment,
and (ii) pay to the Sellers Representative (for distribution to Sellers) the
amount (if any) required to be distributed under _Section 5.04(a)_ from the
Escrow Account.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Except in the case of fraud, the payment (if any) from the Escrow Account
in accordance with _Section 1.02(h)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
for Buyer for payment of the Overpayment (if any) (and recourse against the
Escrow Account shall be Buyers sole and exclusive source of recovery for any
amounts owing to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 1.02_ ). The dispute
resolution provisions provided in this _Section 1.02_ shall be the exclusive
remedies for the matters addressed or that could be addressed therein. For the
avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
claim by Buyer for the payment of the Overpayment shall be asserted against
Sellers or any other Person and none of Sellers shall have any obligation to
fund or otherwise replenish the Escrow Account.

 



 

(j) All payments required pursuant to _Sections 1.02(g)_ and _1.02(h)_ shall
be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price
paid by Buyer for the Company Stock.

 



 

(k) The provisions of this _Section 1.02_ shall apply in such a manner so as
not to give the components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of
adjustment and no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included in whole or
in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than once in calculation of
(including any component of) Aggregate Closing Consideration or any other
calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional
inclusion (either as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount
to be overstated or understated for purposes of such calculation.

 



 

1.03 _The Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Company Stock
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P.,
2001 Ross Avenue, Suite 3700, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 10:00 a.m., on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
as set forth in _Article 7_ hereof (other than those conditions that are to be
satisfied at Closing, but subject to their due satisfaction or waiver at the
Closing), or at such other place or on such other date as may be mutually
agreed to in writing by Buyer, the Company and the Sellers Representative.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_."

 



 

1.04 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 



 

1.05 _Closing Deliveries by the Company and Sellers_. At Closing, the Company

Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any Person against the
Claiming Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Claiming Party shall notify
the Buyer (in cases of claims for indemnification under _Section 5.02_ ) or
the Sellers Representative (in cases of claims for indemnification under

indemnification or escrow recovery, as applicable, provided hereunder except
to the extent the

 



      
 

 



 

Defending Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure. Thereafter, the Claiming Party shall deliver to the Defending

the requirements of this _Section 5.06(b)_ remain true: (i) the Defending
Party notifies the Claiming Party within thirty days after the Claiming Party
has given written notice of a Third Party Claim to the Defending Party (unless
in such notice the Claiming Party certifies, in good faith, that the failure
to assume such defense within fifteen days would materially prejudice the
Claiming Party by a delay in assuming the defense beyond fifteen days, in
which case, the Claiming Party shall have the right to assume the defense
subsequent to the expiration of such fifteen day period if the Defending Party
fails to so assume the defense thereof), that the Defending Party is assuming
the defense of such Third Party Claim; and (ii) the Defending Party conducts
the defense of the Third Party Claim in an active and diligent manner;
_provided_ that the Defending Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Claiming Party) if (x)
the Third Party Claim relates to any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation or (y) the Third Party Claim primarily seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Claiming Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Defending Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim unless it has acknowledged in writing to the Claiming Party
that indemnification or recovery from the Escrow Account applies to such Third
Party Claim. Should a Defending Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall not be liable to the Claiming
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in
connection with the defense thereof unless (I) the employment of separate
counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Defending Party in
connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim or (II) the Claiming
Partys counsel shall have advised the Claiming Party in writing, with a copy
delivered to the Defending Party, that there is a conflict of interest that
would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct
to have common counsel. If the Defending Party assumes such defense, the
Claiming Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Defending Party, it being understood, however, that the Defending Party
shall control such defense (including any settlement with respect thereto);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Defending Party shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Claiming Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the validity of the Third Party
Claim if such resolution would involve anything other than the payment of
monetary damages in an amount less than the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account and does not include an unconditional provision whereby the
plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Claiming Party and all of its
Affiliates and representatives from all liability with respect thereto. If the
Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then all the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim, including by retaining and (upon the Defending Partys request)
providing to the Defending Party all records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Sellers Representative shall
act on behalf of all Defending Parties in the case of all Third Party Claims
with respect to which Buyer is seeking indemnification pursuant to _Section
5.03_ or funds from the Escrow Account under _Section 5.04_. Whether or not
Sellers Representative shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim for which any
sums are recoverable from the Escrow Account without the prior written consent
of Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In any case in which a Claiming Party seeks indemnification or recovery
from the Escrow Account under this Agreement not arising out of a Third Party
Claim, the Claiming Party shall notify the Defending Party in writing of any
Losses that such Claiming Party claims are subject to indemnification or
recovery from the Escrow Account under the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
required to submit a written claim for any Losses relating to, or arising in
respect of or in connection with, (i) the items described on _Schedule
5.01(b)_ , or (ii) any amounts paid by the Company to any tax advisor or any
other advisor, including any accounting firm or any law firm, in connection
with the audit of any tax return by the Internal Revenue Service or any state
or local taxing authority which audit is controlled by the Sellers
Representative; and Buyer shall be deemed to have submitted a claim for any
Losses relating to, or arising in respect of or in connection with, the
matters set forth the foregoing clauses (i) and(ii) prior to the applicable
Survival Date. The notice shall describe the indemnification sought in
reasonable detail to the extent known, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary, and if then estimable) of the Loss that has been or
may be suffered. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5.04(c)_ and
_Section 5.06_ , the failure of the Claiming Party to exercise promptness in
such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only
to the extent that the resulting delay actually materially and adversely
prejudices the position of the Defending Party with respect to such claim.

 



 

5.07 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 



 

5.08 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

 



 

(a) Any Losses claimed hereunder shall be net of any insurance or similar
proceeds recoverable by any Person entitled to indemnification or escrow
recovery, as applicable, hereunder to the extent actually recovered. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any such Person with
respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified or
otherwise recovered hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate net amount
of the recovery from the insurance or similar policy or program shall be made
promptly to the Person providing the indemnity or other recovery hereunder.
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with Buyers
standard policies and practices, to submit claims to insurance companies for
Losses covered by insurance policies of the Company or of Buyer. Buyer shall
not be required to submit claims or seek indemnification from any Person
except insurance companies as discussed in the previous sentence, nor shall
Buyer be required to file suit or initiate litigation, mediation or other
proceedings against any insurance company or other Person.

 



 

(b) In no event shall any Person be entitled to recover or make a claim for
any amounts in respect of consequential, punitive or exemplary damages (except
to the extent payable in connection with a Third Party Claim).

 



 

(c) No Person shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment,
reimbursement, restitution or indemnity hereunder more than once in respect of
any one Loss or related group of Losses.

accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in _Section 1.02_ ), its sole

Person may have at law or equity due to the fraud of such Person. None of the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in
this _Section 5.09(c)_ , shall be deemed a waiver by any Person of (or a
limitation on) any right or remedy that such Person may have at law or equity
due to the fraud of any other Person.

 



 

5.10 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date for
all Pre-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by applicable law. At least 30 days
(or 45 days in the case of the 2012 federal Tax Return) prior to the date on
which each such Tax Return is to be filed, Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

shall submit such Tax Return to Sellers Representative for review and
approval, which approval may be withheld only if such Tax Return has not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of this _Section 5.10(a)_. The
Buyer will cause such Tax Return to be timely filed and will provide a copy to
the Sellers Representative. With respect to the federal Straddle Period Tax
Return, the Buyer will cause such Tax Return to be filed by the earlier of (i)
September 15, 2013 or (ii) 60 days following the date of payment of all
amounts due pursuant to the final resolution of the matters set forth on
_Schedule 5.01(b)_ with the Internal Revenue Service and any state taxing
authorities; _provided_ , _however_ , if such 60th day is not a Business Day,
then by the first Business Day following such 60th day.

 



 

(b) The parties will not make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate the 2012 income and loss of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In completing such 2012 Returns, the Transaction
Expenses and any other applicable expenses of the Company associated with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall, to the extent properly deductible for
federal income tax purposes as determined by the Buyer in its reasonable
discretion (following consultation with the Sellers Representative), be
separately reported and allocated to the Pre-Closing stub period return. **
**To the extent that Buyer exercises an election or otherwise makes an
allocation of a pre-Closing expense or deduction that results in an expense or
deduction that could be properly deductible in the Pre-Closing stub period
return being allocated or deducted in a post-closing federal tax return of the
Company, and such allocation results in an increase in a cash Tax liability of
the Company for any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, any such
increase in cash Tax liability to the Company which, under this Agreement,
results in a potential claim by the Buyer against the Escrow Account shall not
be a valid claim against the Escrow Account.

 



 

(c) In the case of such Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of
the period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries ended with (and included) the Closing Date; provided that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the period
beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
period; and

 



 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company or any Subsidiary, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period.

 



 

(d) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Sellers Representative and
Sellers shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any
other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section 5.10_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets,
operations, or activities of the Company or any Subsidiary. The Parties agree
that the Sellers Representative shall control all aspects of the currently
pending federal tax audit, provided that the Sellers Representative shall (i)
obtain the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement,
compromise, admission or acknowledgement of any disputed issue with respect to
the audit, and (ii) give reasonable consideration to Buyers suggestions and
input in determining

 



      
 

 



 

the course of action in dealing with such audit or any related proceeding.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Sellers Representative further agrees,
upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other documentation from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed on the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary, including, but not
limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers Representative shall not be required to take any
action that would impose or increase any obligation on the part of the
Sellers, or create or increase any claim against the Escrow **** unless Buyer
states in writing to the Sellers Representative in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers Representative that as a result of Buyer requiring
the action by Sellers Representative, Buyer will not make any claim against
the Escrow Account for any increase in cash Tax liability directly related to
the increase in cash Tax liability that arises as a result of the action
required of the Sellers Representative by the Buyer under this _Section
5.10(d)_. The Company and its Subsidiaries and Sellers shall (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Buyer or the Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.

 



 

(e) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against income Taxes to which Buyer or
the Company and its Subsidiaries may become entitled, that relate to Tax
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (other than
any refund resulting from the carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax
attribute arising in a Tax period ending after the Closing) shall be for the
account of Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or
credit (net of any Taxes payable by Buyer as a result of any such refund or
credit) within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. To the extent
that Buyer uses net operating losses generated during Tax periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date to reduce income Taxes for any
Tax period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date that could have
been applied to reduce any income Taxes due for Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date resulting from the matters described on _Schedule
5.01(b)_ , then Buyers claims against the Escrow Account shall be reduced by
the amount of income Taxes that would have been avoided by application of such
net operating losses to the Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
If any such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed, the Taxes payable by
the Company in connection with the disallowance of such refund or credit shall
be treated as Seller Taxes subject to indemnification or escrow recovery under
_Section 5.04_.

 



 

(f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or other
similar Taxes imposed on the Company or Sellers directly or indirectly as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer
Taxes shall be paid 50% by Sellers and 50% by Buyer. The Buyer will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate in the filing of any returns
with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying information
in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.
Sellers portion of such Transfer Taxes will be paid from the Aggregate
Closing Consideration and will be retained by Buyer at Closing for such
purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) From and after the Closing, neither party will make any election, file any
amended return, settle any contest or audit, or take any other position
(unless otherwise specified herein), the effect of which would be to
materially adversely affect the other or create or increase any claim against
the Escrow Account, without the prior written consent of the other.

 



 

5.11 _Further Assurances_. From time to time from and after the Closing, as
and when reasonably requested by any party hereto and at such requesting
partys expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party
may reasonably deem necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.12 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Company to provide the Sellers Representative and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying) during normal business hours (and without causing undue interruption
or interference with the Company and its Subsidiaries business) and with
advance written notice to Buyer, to the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing
Date for any reasonable purpose relating to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representative
and its authorized representatives are not entitled to access, review, examine
or copy any books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries containing
any confidential information the disclosure of which is prohibited under a
confidentiality or similar agreement with a third party or privileged
(including attorney-client privilege) information unless in the case of
confidential information that is not privileged (including attorney-client
privilege) information such confidential information is reasonably necessary
to the Sellers Representatives duties relating to this Agreement and the
Sellers Representative has executed a confidentiality agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Unless otherwise consented
to in writing by Sellers Representative, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall not
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, for a period of five years
following the Closing Date, destroy or otherwise dispose of any books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any portions thereof,
relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable
prior notice to Sellers and offering to surrender to Sellers Representative
such books and records or such portions thereof.

 



 

5.13 _Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification, and Insurance_. For a
period of six years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and
directors (unless required by law), it being the intent of the parties that
such Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of the law and
as otherwise provided for in the provisions of such documents. The Company has
arranged for, and shall pay for in full at the Closing, a directors and
officers liability "tail" or "runoff" insurance policy for the benefit of all
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers and directors before the
Closing with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or prior to the Closing Date (the " _Tail Policy_ "). The Tail Policy shall be
issued by the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
carrier, shall be in an amount and scope at least as favorable to the Company
and its insured directors and officers as the Companys existing policies with
respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date, and shall provide for a claims period of six years after the
Closing Date. The cost of the Tail Policy shall be split 50/50 between the
Buyer and the Company, and the cost of the Tail Policy shall be treated as a
Transaction Expense.

 



 

5.14 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. For a period of three years from and
after the Closing Date, neither Fenway Panther Holdings, LLC nor any Affiliate
thereof shall, directly or indirectly, cause, solicit, induce or encourage to
leave the employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or solicit,

 



      
 

 



 

hire or employ, or cause any other Person to solicit, hire or employ, any
Person (including independent contractors providing transportation services)
then retained or employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date or retained or employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
within the six month period immediately prior to the Closing Date, unless such
Person (including independent contractors providing transportation services)
has ceased to be employed or retained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a period of at least six months; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Fenway Panther Holdings, LLC and its Affiliates shall not be prohibited
from (a) engaging in general advertisements or executive recruitment or
employment agency searches not specifically directed at or targeting Persons
who are retained or employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b)
retaining or employing any independent contractors providing transportation
services or hourly and clerical employees who are retained or employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries who respond to general advertisements or
employment agency searches not specifically directed at or targeting Persons
who are retained or employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(c) provided that it would not violate the terms of the Amended and Restated
Employment Agreement, dated June 30, 2011, among the Company, Panther II
Transportation, Inc. and Daniel Sokolowski, retaining or employing Daniel S.
Sokolowski.

 



 

5.15 _Termination of the Stockholders Agreement_. The Amended and Restated
Stockholders Agreement among certain holders of Company Stock and the Company
dated January 11, 2006 (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ") shall terminate on
and as of the Closing (including any provision which would otherwise survive
termination in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement), and
the parties thereto agree that all of the rights, benefits, obligations and
liabilities of any party under the Stockholders Agreement shall cease and
terminate, that none of the parties under the Stockholders Agreement shall
have any further duty, liability or obligations under the Stockholders
Agreement to one another from and after the Closing, including any duty or
liability incurred as of such date of the Closing, or which may in the future
be incurred, and that the Stockholders Agreement shall have no further force
or effect.

10.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, but with it being understood that neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by
any party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may assign any or all of
its rights pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to one or more
of its Affiliates, provided, that Buyer will nonetheless remain liable for all
of its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer may assign any or all of its rights pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement to any of its lenders as collateral security without the
consent of any of the other parties hereto.

 



 

10.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Upon such a determination, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

10.06 _Construction and Disclosure_. Buyer, Sellers, the Company and the
Sellers Representative each acknowledge and agree that they and their
respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the
joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto, and the language used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to

 



      
 

 



 

express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Schedules is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside
of the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this
Agreement or in any Schedule is or is not required to be disclosed (including
whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of business for
purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this Agreement and in
the Schedules hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and
no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission
by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of law or breach of contract). Disclosure of an item on one Schedule
shall be deemed disclosure on another Schedule if (i) a cross reference to
such other Schedule is made or (ii) it is readily apparent that the disclosed
contract, event, fact, circumstance or other matter relates to the
representations or warranties covered by such other Schedule. Capitalized
terms used in the Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement. Time is of the essence in the
performance of each of the parties respective obligations contained herein.

 



 

10.07 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and descriptions of the
Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of reference only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit,
characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no such
caption or description had been used in this Agreement.

 



 

10.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended only in a writing
executed and delivered by each of Buyer, the Company and Sellers
Representative. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived only in a
writing signed by the party against whom such waiver is to be enforced. For
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to a waiver by any one or more Sellers,
such waiver may be signed by the Sellers Representative. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default hereunder shall extend to or
affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or
default.

 



 

10.09 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement between the Company and Buyer dated February 2, 2012, the Escrow
Agreement and any other agreements referred to herein or therein and executed
and delivered on or after the date hereof in connection herewith or therewith,
contain the complete agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between such
parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof
in any way. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnity contained in any Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement delivered
in connection with any lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificate
representing Company Stock shall survive indefinitely as specified in such
Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and such survival shall not be
affected by the limited survival of the Sellers representations and
warranties in this Agreement, and such indemnity shall not be limited by or
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including _Article 5_
hereof.

 



 

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

10.11 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

10.12 _JURISDICTION; VENUE; SERVICE OF PROCESS_. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
_SECTION 1.02_ (WHICH SHALL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY SEEKING RELIEF UNDER OR PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
PROPERLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, LIE IN ANY FEDERAL COURT (OR, IF SUCH FEDERAL
COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, IN A
STATE COURT) IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH
COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR
INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN
RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE
VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR
SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT.

 



 

10.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES
HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

10.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) for the Buyer Indemnities
under _Article 5_ , (b) as provided in _Section 5.13_ and (c) for the
Financing Sources with respect to _Section 10.11_ , _Section 10.13_ , this
_Section 10.14_ and _Section 10.19_ (and none of the parties hereto shall
amend, modify or otherwise change any of _Section 10.11_ , _Section 10.13_ ,
this _Section 10.14_ and _Section 10.19_ in a manner adverse to any of the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources),
no Person other than the parties hereto shall have any rights, remedies, or
benefits under any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

10.15 _Payments Under Agreement_. Each party agrees that all amounts required
to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount, rebate or
reduction and subject to no counterclaim or offset, on the dates specified
herein.

 



   

     
 

 



 

10.16 _Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller constitutes and appoints Fenway Panther Holdings, LLC as its
representative (the " _Sellers  Representative_") and its true and lawful
attorney in fact, with full power and authority in its name and on its behalf:

 



 

(i) to act on such Sellers behalf (and on behalf of the Option Holders and
CIP Participants) in the absolute and reasonable discretion of Sellers
Representative with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement
(including, without limitation, actions or inactions in respect of _Section
1.02_ , _Article 5_ , _Article 7_ and _Article 8_ hereof) and the other
Transaction Documents, and in connection with the activities to be performed
on behalf of the Sellers, Option Holders and CIP Participants under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
including, without limitation, execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents, with such modifications or changes as the Sellers Representative
shall have consented to; any amendment, supplement, or modification of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; and the pursuit, defense,
settlement, or waiver of any claim or right arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; and

 



 

(ii) in general, to do all things and to perform all acts in the absolute and
reasonable discretion of Sellers Representative, including, without
limitation, (A) disputing or refraining from disputing any claim made by Buyer
or any Buyer Indemnitee under or with respect to any provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, (B) acting on behalf of Sellers,
the Option Holders and the CIP Participants in any litigation or arbitration
or mediation involving this Agreement (including the indemnification and
escrow recovery obligations set forth in _Article 5_ ) or any other
Transaction Document and negotiating and compromising on behalf of each
Seller, Option Holder and CIP Participant, any dispute that may arise under,
and exercising or refraining from exercising any remedies available under the
Transaction Documents, (C) executing, on behalf of each Seller, Option Holder
and CIP Participant, any settlement, release, waiver or other document with
respect to such dispute or remedy, (D) executing and delivering all
agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices and other
instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 10.16_ , and (E) any and all things deemed necessary or
desirable in the absolute discretion of Sellers Representative in connection
with the exercise of any of the foregoing powers and authorities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers Representative shall not act in such a manner
that treats similarly situated Sellers materially differently unless such
Sellers have consented to such materially different treatment.

 



 

(b) This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an
interest and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this
Agreement and is irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any
Seller or by operation of law, whether by the death, incompetency, incapacity,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller or by the occurrence of any other
event, and shall be binding on any successor thereto. Each Seller hereby
consents to the taking of any and all actions, the execution of any and all
documents and agreements, and the making of any decisions required or
permitted to be taken or made by Sellers Representative pursuant to this
_Section 10.16_. Each Seller agrees that Sellers Representative shall have no
obligation or liability to any Person for any action taken or omitted by
Sellers Representative in good faith, and each Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless Sellers Representative from, and shall pay to Sellers
Representative the amount of, or reimburse Sellers Representative for, any
loss or expense that Sellers Representative may suffer, sustain, or become
subject to as a result of any such action or omission by Sellers
Representative under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, unless
such loss or expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have been caused
by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Sellers Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Any decision or action by the Sellers Representative hereunder shall
constitute a decision or action of all of the Sellers and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Seller, and no Seller shall have the right to
object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest any such decision or
action. Any notices required to be made or delivered to the Sellers hereunder
or under any other Transaction Document shall be made or delivered to the
Sellers Representative for the benefit of the applicable Seller and the
making or delivering of such notice to the Sellers Representative shall
discharge in full the applicable notice requirement.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall be entitled to rely exclusively and absolutely upon the
communications of Sellers Representative relating to the foregoing as the
communications of the Sellers, and upon any document or other paper delivered
by Sellers Representative as being authorized by Sellers, from the date
hereof until all obligations and transactions contemplated by and under this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document shall have been consummated
and/or discharged. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the authority of
Sellers Representative to act on behalf of all Sellers hereunder, and Buyer
shall not be liable or accountable in any manner to any Seller for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer based on such reliance, or for any act
or omission of the Sellers Representative in such capacity.

 



 

(e) Fenway Panther Holdings, LLC and any Person selected to replace Fenway
Panther Holdings, LLC pursuant to this Agreement, may resign as Sellers
Representative at any time by delivering prior written notice to the Company
and Buyer. Until all obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall have been discharged, Sellers who, immediately
prior to the Closing, are entitled in the aggregate to receive more than 50%
of the Aggregate Closing Consideration, may, from time to time upon notice to
Buyer and all the Sellers, appoint a new Sellers Representative upon the
death, incapacity, or resignation of Sellers Representative. If, after the
death, incapacity, or resignation of Sellers Representative, a successor
Sellers Representative shall not have been appointed by Sellers within 15
Business Days after the death, incapacity, or resignation of the prior
Sellers Representative, Buyer may appoint a Sellers Representative from
among the Sellers, Option Holders and CIP Participants and their respective
Affiliates to fill any vacancy so created or may petition a court in the
applicable jurisdiction to appoint a Sellers Representative from among the
Sellers, Option Holders and CIP Participants and their respective Affiliates.
Upon any appointment of a successor Sellers Representative by Sellers,
Sellers shall give Buyer prompt written notice (in any event no later than
three Business Days following such appointment) of the appointment of the
successor Sellers Representative and the name and contact information for
such successor Sellers Representative.

 



 

(f) As used in this Section 10.16, the term "Transaction Documents" shall be
deemed to exclude the Employment Agreement Amendments entered into by any
Seller.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.16, Sellers
Representative shall have no authority to act as the attorney, agent, or
representative, or to execute any documents, on behalf of any Seller to the
extent they relate to any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification
under _Section 5.03_.

 



 

(h) The Sellers Representative acknowledges that it has carefully read and
understands this Agreement and hereby accepts the appointment and designation
made hereunder.

 



 

10.17 _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto

 



      
 

 



 

shall re execute original forms hereof or thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise (a) the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or (b) the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

10.18 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that Scudder Law Firm, P.C., L.L.O. may serve as counsel to Sellers
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that following the
Closing, Scudder Law Firm, P.C., L.L.O. may serve as counsel to any member of
the Seller Group or any director, manager, member, partner, owner, officer,
employee or Affiliate thereof in connection with any claim, dispute or other
matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including in connection with any matters
contemplated by _Section 1.02_ hereof), notwithstanding such representation
(or any continued representation) of Seller, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom or in connection therewith.

 



 

10.19 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, suit or proceeding (each, an
" _Action_ "), including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Transaction, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any agreement entered into by
the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing Transaction or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of _Section 10.13_
relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any Action, including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim referenced in
this _Section 10.19_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Sellers and Sellers Representative (and on
behalf of any of their respective stockholders, partners, equity award
holders, members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives
or agents) agrees that it will not bring or support any Action, including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of such entities or their Affiliates respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Transaction or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
the Financing Transaction, including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to any agreement entered into by the Financing Sources in connection
with the Financing Transaction or the performance thereof. For purposes of
this Agreement, (i) " _Financing Transaction_ " means the financing by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to obtain funds to be used to pay all or any portion
of the payments contemplated by _Article 1_ and/or any of the fees and
expenses related to or arising out of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) " _Financing Sources_ " means any Person that
provides, or has or in the future enters into any contract or agreement with
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to provide, any of the Financing Transaction,
any of such Persons Affiliates and any of such Persons or any of its
Affiliates respective current, former or future officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, stockholders, limited partners, managers,
members or partners. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section
10.19_ shall not apply to Buyer or its

 



      
 

 



 

representatives as those matters are or will be addressed instead in the
Commitment Letters or the definitive documentation for the Financing
Transaction
