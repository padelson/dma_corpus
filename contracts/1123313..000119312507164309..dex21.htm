NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set

sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as

forth herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Corporation Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") on the second Business Day (as defined below), following the
satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing (as defined below) but subject to their satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver, at the Closing) or on such other day as the
parties may mutually agree. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the name "Kyphon Inc." and
shall continue its existence under the Laws (as defined below) of the State of
Delaware. In connection with the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease. Upon the election of Parent, the Merger may be
structured so that the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with
Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be deemed to have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, to the extent such breach results from such election by Parent.



 

1 Section 1.02. _Consummation of the Merger_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a duly executed certificate of merger, as required by the Corporation
Law, which may specify the date and time mutually agreed by the parties at
which the Merger will become effective, and the parties shall take all such
further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. Prior
to the filing referred to in this Section, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") will
be held at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty
Plaza, New York, New York (or such other place as the parties may mutually
agree) for the purpose of confirming all the matters contained herein. The
time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with applicable Law is
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ".

Section 1.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the Corporation Law.

Section 1.04. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall comply with
_Section 5.06(a)_ hereof), except that Article I thereof shall read as
follows: "The name of the Corporation is Kyphon Inc." and, as so amended,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as permitted by Law and this Agreement. The Bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall
comply with _Section 5.06(a)_ hereof), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.05. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective death,
permanent disability, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.

Section 1.06. _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock of the
Company, par value $0.001 per share (each, a " _Share_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or the
Company or held in the treasury of the Company, all of which shall be
canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefor, and other than
Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which shall have only those rights set
forth in _Section 2.01_) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) equal to $71.00, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate, if any,
representing such Shares in accordance with _Article II_. At the Effective
Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.



 

2 Section 1.07. _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.08. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger, or otherwise, such amounts as
are required to be withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 1.09. _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the
Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of the Company as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the
intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

Article II

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

Section 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be
treated in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and
Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the  



 

3  Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the
Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make
the payments due pursuant to _Section 1.06_ on a timely basis to holders of
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments
provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. Such funds may
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , that (i)no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares and following
any losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that
remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company to the extent of such
insufficiency and (ii)such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of the Effective Time, was the
record holder of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.06_: (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Following surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash
in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product
of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration,
and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below) other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered  



 

4  or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and
until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.02_,
each Certificate shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive,
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash
multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any
interest thereon.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary and reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
complied with this _Section 2.02_ prior to the end of such one-year period
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such Shares or
otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date
that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consolidation as provided in this
_Article II_.

Section 2.04. _Existing Stock Options; Other Equity Based Awards_. (a) Each
option to purchase Shares (" _Existing Stock Options_ ") granted to employees
or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Kyphon Inc. 1996 Stock Option Plan,
the Kyphon Inc. 2002 Stock Plan, and the 2002 Director Option Plan (together,
the " _Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time or
that is held by a member of the Companys Board of Directors who is not a
Company Employee (a " _Vested Existing Stock Option_ ") shall, at the
Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount,
payable in cash as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, equal to
the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such Vested Existing
Stock Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise  



 

5  price per share of the Shares subject to such Vested Existing Stock Option,
less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with
respect to such payment (the " _Option Cashout Amount_ "). Those Existing
Stock Options granted to employees or directors of, or consultants or advisors
to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Stock
Plans or otherwise outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are not, as of the Effective Time, vested and exercisable and are not
held by members of the Companys Board of Directors who are not Company
Employees (the " _Unvested Existing Stock Options_ "), shall be converted
into options (the " _Adjusted Options_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions as applied to each such Unvested Existing Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of whole shares of Parent common
stock that is equal to the number of Shares subject to such Unvested Existing
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise
price per share of Parent common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole penny)
equal to the exercise price for each such Share subject to such Unvested
Existing Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Stock Plans or the agreements evidencing the awards of any Unvested
Existing Stock Options, in the event that, within the twelve (12)
month period following the Effective Time, the employment of any Company
Employee who holds any Adjusted Options is terminated by the Company without
Cause, or by such Company Employee for Good Reason, any Adjusted Options that
are not, as of such termination, vested and exercisable shall become, upon
such termination, fully vested and exercisable, and shall otherwise remain
subject to the provisions of the applicable Stock Plan and the agreement
evidencing the award of such Adjusted Options. 

(b) Those Shares and Company restricted stock units granted to employees or
directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plans outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and subject to vesting conditions or other
restrictions as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Existing
Restricted Shares_ ") shall be converted into restricted shares, or
restricted stock units, as the case may be, on the same terms and conditions
as applied to each such Existing Restricted Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent common
stock that is equal to the number of Shares subject to such Existing
Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share) (the " _Adjusted
Restricted Shares_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Stock Plans or the agreements evidencing the awards of any
Existing Restricted Shares, in the event that, within the twelve (12) month
period following the Effective Time, the employment of any Company Employee
who holds any Adjusted Restricted Shares is terminated by the Company without
Cause, or by such Company Employee for Good Reason, any Adjusted
Restricted Shares that are not, as of such termination, vested and free of
restrictions shall become, upon such termination, fully vested and free of
restrictions.

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations and succeed
to the rights of the Company under the Stock Plans with respect to the
Adjusted Options and the Adjusted Restricted Shares. Parent and the Company
agree that prior to the Effective Time, each of the Stock Plans shall be
amended, to the extent possible without requiring stockholder approval of such
amendments (i) if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, the conversion of the  



 

6  Existing Stock Options and Existing Restricted Shares pursuant to paragraphs
(a) and (b) above and the substitution of Parent for the Company thereunder
to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such Stock Plans by
Parent and (ii) to preclude any automatic or formulaic grant of options,
restricted shares or other awards thereunder on or after the date hereof,
except as otherwise permitted in this Agreement. From and after the Effective
Time, all references to the Company (other than references relating to a
"change in control" of the Company) in each Stock Plan and in each agreement
evidence any award under the Stock Plans shall be deemed to refer to Parent.

(d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent common stock for delivery upon
exercise of Unvested Existing Stock Options and upon vesting of restricted
stock units assumed in accordance with this Section 2.04. No later than five
(5) business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Parent
common stock issuable upon exercise of any assumed Unvested Existing Stock
Options or upon vesting of any assumed restricted stock units for which a Form
S-8 registration statement is available to be registered with the SEC on Form
S-8 and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options or such restricted stock units remain
outstanding.

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Existing Stock Options and Existing Restricted Shares
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans and describing the adjustments required by this Section 2.04.

Section 2.05. _Company ESPP_. The current offerings in progress as of the date
of this Agreement under the Companys 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company ESPP") shall continue, and Shares shall be issued to participants
thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring
after the date hereof as provided under, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Company ESPP. In accordance with Section 20(a) of the
Company ESPP, any offering in progress as of the Effective Date shall end on
the date immediately preceding the Effective Time and the Company ESPP and
each then outstanding option under the Company ESPP shall be terminated
without being exercised as of such date and accumulated payroll deferrals
shall be returned to Company ESPP participants as soon as
practicable following such termination. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall not permit participants in the Company ESPP to increase their
elections thereunder with respect to any offering period under the Company
ESPP that commences after the date hereof. The Company shall terminate the
Company ESPP, effective as of the Effective Time.

Article III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF THE COMPANY 

Subject, in the case of each representation and warranty in this _Article
III_, to _Section 8.01(b)_, and except, with respect to any Section of this
_Article III_, (i) as set forth in the section of the disclosure letter dated
the date hereof and delivered by the Company to Parent with  



 

7  respect to this Agreement prior to the date hereof (the " _Disclosure
Letter_ ") that specifically corresponds to such Section (or in any
other section of the Disclosure Letter if the applicability of such
disclosure to such Section is reasonably apparent on its face) and (ii) as
disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
filed by the Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in
each case, on or after February 28, 2007, and prior to the date hereof (to the
extent such disclosure does not constitute a "risk factor" or forward-looking
statement and such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to relate to
such Section of _Article III_ below), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that the following are true and correct:

Section 3.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a duly organized and validly existing entity in good standing
(to the extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction)
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all corporate power
and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as
currently conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do
business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties
owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by
it makes such qualification necessary. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in
effect for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any
Person other than the Companys Subsidiaries.

Section 3.02. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 120,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of preferred

of business on July 25, 2007, 45,901,784 Shares were issued and outstanding,
no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and 30,000 Shares
were held in the Companys treasury. In addition, as of such date, there were

Shares, no Shares underlying any other outstanding awards under the
Stock Plans, an aggregate of 1,000,000 Shares authorized under the Company
ESPP and there were no shares of restricted stock granted under the Plans or
stock appreciation rights outstanding. Since such date, the Company has not
issued any Shares, has not granted any options, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights, warrants or rights or entered into any other agreements
or commitments to issue any Shares, or granted any other awards in respect of
any Shares and has not split, combined or reclassified any of its shares of
capital stock. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are free of preemptive
rights. _Section 3.02(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of (i) the name of each such
Existing Stock Option holder, the number of outstanding Existing Stock Options
held by such holder, the grant date of each such Existing Stock Option, the
number of Shares such holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of each

schedule of each such Existing Stock Options and the plan pursuant to which
each such Existing Stock Option was granted; and (iii) the name of the holder

Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (together with the 2012 Notes, the "
_Convertible Notes_ ") and the call  



 

8  options and warrants entered into in connection with the sale of the

each case, the economic equivalent thereof), (C) obligations of the Company to
grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or
exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to
any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in the
Company (the items in _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ , together with the
capital stock of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Company
Securities_ ") or (iv) obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to make any payments based on the price or value of the Shares. There are on
the date hereof no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities.
There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
capital stock of the Company. All outstanding securities of the Company have
been offered and issued in compliance with all applicable securities laws,
including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ")
and "blue sky" laws.

(b) The Company or another of its Subsidiaries is the record and beneficial

the Company, free and clear of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge, security
interest or encumbrance of any kind, and there are no irrevocable proxies with

securities or other ownership interests in) any Subsidiary of the Company,
(iii) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend
or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable
security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital
stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the
Company (the items in  _clauses (i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , together with
the capital stock of such Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as "
_Subsidiary Securities_ ") or (iv) obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any payment based on the value of any shares of any
Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any

with the terms of all applicable Stock Plans, stock exchange rules and
applicable Laws, (ii) have been fairly presented in accordance with GAAP in
the Companys financial statements set forth in the  



 

9  Company SEC Reports, and (iii) have resulted only in exercise prices that
correspond to the fair market value on the date that the grants were
actually authorized under applicable Law. The Company has no ongoing internal

Parent the results of any such review completed since January 1, 2005.

Section 3.05. _Reports; Financial Statements_. (a) Since January 1, 2005, the
Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), all of which have
complied as of their respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by
a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing made at least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ") and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Report. None of the
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed or furnished
by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2005 (the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "), including any financial statements or schedules included or
incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment
or superseding filing made at least two Business Days prior to the date
hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to the Company SEC Reports. None of the Companys
Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act.

(b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including the
related notes thereto) of the Company included (or incorporated by reference)
in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and the consolidated income,
stockholders equity, results of operations and changes in consolidated
financial position or cash flows for the periods  



 

11  presented therein (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). All of the Companys
Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting purposes. The unaudited
consolidated financial statements (including the related notes thereto) of the
Company for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007, when finalized and filed
in the Companys Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007, will
not differ in any material respect (except for the inclusion of additional,
consistent information) from that set forth in the draft of the earnings press
release included in  _Section 3.05(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2006 and
the description of such assessment set forth in the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 is accurate in all
material respects. The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those
entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of
the Companys Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. A true, correct and complete summary of any such disclosures made
by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee is set forth as
_Section 3.05(c)_ of the Disclosure Letter. As of the date hereof, there is
no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when due.

(d) Since January 1, 2005, (i) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of United States federal or state securities laws, material breach
of fiduciary duty arising under United States federal or state law, or
similar material violation of any United States federal or state law by the
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to the Chief Executive
Officer or General Counsel of the Company.



 

12 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, whether
due or to become due and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected
on a balance sheet under GAAP, other than such liabilities (i) reflected or
reserved against in the financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Reports filed and available prior to the date hereof, (ii)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since March 31, 2007 that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
_Section 8.10_).

Section 3.06. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006, (a) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not suffered any Material Adverse Effect
and there has not been any change, condition, event or development that is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company, (b) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, except for the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and (c) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action that, if taken after the date hereof, would constitute a
breach of (i) clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (d), (ii) paragraphs (e), (f),
(g), (h), (j), (r), (s) and (t) of _Section 5.01_ and (iii) paragraph (v) of
_Section 5.01_, but only insofar as such paragraph (v) relates to the clauses
and paragraphs set forth in the preceding _clauses (i) and (ii)_.

Section 3.07. _Proxy Statement_. The letter to stockholders, notice of
meeting, proxy statement and form of proxy that will be provided
to stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) and any annexes, schedules or exhibits
required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") will not, on the date of filing with the SEC, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed and at the time of the Special
Meeting (as defined below), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, or to correct any statement made in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy or approval for
the Merger in connection with which the Proxy Statement shall be mailed,
except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to information supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Sub expressly for inclusion therein. The Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. 

Section 3.08. _Brokers; Certain Expenses_. No broker, finder, investment
banker or financial advisor (other than J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "
_Company Financial Advisor_ "), a true, correct and complete copy of whose
engagement letter has been furnished to Parent, and whose fees and expenses
shall be paid by the Company) is or shall be entitled to receive any
brokerage, finders, financial advisors, transaction or other fee or
commission in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby based upon agreements  



 

13  made by or on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors or employees; _provided_ , _however_
, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
understands and agrees that the Company shall be permitted to engage a second
financial advisor if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Financial Advisor
has a conflict of interest and, taking into account the advice of outside
counsel to the Company, such engagement is necessary in connection with
satisfaction of the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company.

Section 3.09. _Employee Benefit Matters/Employees_. (a) _Section 3.09(a)_

(v) offer, agree or commit, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the
foregoing actions.

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts

execution by such Person or group of a confidentiality agreement substantially
in the form of, and with terms at least as restrictive in all material
respects on such Person or group as, the Confidentiality Agreement is on

any time prior to the adoption of the agreement of merger contained in this
Agreement by the requisite vote of the holders of Shares, furnish information
(so long as all such information has previously been made available to Parent
or Merger Sub or is made available to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or
concurrently with the time such information is made available to such Person
or group) to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any Person or
group that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
received after the date hereof and not resulting from a breach of this
_Section 5.02_ only to the extent that (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the
legal, financial, financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal, that such unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the failure to
take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (iii) the Company has
provided Parent prior written notice of its intent to take any such action at
least one Business Day prior to taking such action.



 

34 (b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) (i)
notify Parent if any such information is requested or any such negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated, and (ii) communicate to Parent and
Merger Sub the identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry
(the " _Potential Acquiror_ ") and the material terms of such request,
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and (iii) shall provide copies of any written
communications or other documents received from or sent to or on behalf of the
Potential Acquiror that describe the financial or other material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep Parent and Merger Sub
reasonably informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations and

Sub of any modifications to the financial or other material terms of any such
request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and
Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons other than Parent
and Merger Sub conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall notify any such Person with whom it has had any
such discussions during the prior 180 days that the Company is no longer
seeking the making of any Acquisition Proposal and thereby withdraws any
request or consent theretofore given to the making of an Acquisition Proposal
and shall request the return or destruction of any nonpublic
information provided to any such Person in connection with any such
activities, discussions or negotiations.

(d) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this
Agreement, the agreement of merger contained herein or the Merger or its
recommendation that the Companys stockholders adopt the agreement of merger
contained in this Agreement, in each case, as set forth in _Section 3.03(b)_,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) unless the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (x) release
any third party from any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party or (y) fail to enforce to the fullest extent possible or
grant any waiver, request or consent to any Acquisition Proposal under, any
such agreement or (iv) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 5.02(a)_)
related to any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may
withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation
that the Companys stockholders adopt the agreement of merger contained in
this Agreement: (i) except if the Company has received an Acquisition
Proposal, in which case clause (ii) shall govern, if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice of
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the  



 

35  Company under applicable Law, or (ii) if (A) the Company has received a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
violation of this _Section 5.02_, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the
legal, financial, financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, that such unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to
accept or recommend such Acquisition Proposal as a Superior Proposal, (C) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving
advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, (D) the Company provides Parent prior written
notice of its intent to take any such action at least four Business Days prior
to taking such action, including all of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), (E) during such
four Business Day period, the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and
Merger Sub (to the extent that Parent and Merger Sub wish to negotiate) to
enable Parent and Merger Sub to make an offer that is at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal, (F) Parent and
Merger Sub do not, within such four Business Day period, make an offer that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel and
after taking into account the legal, financial, financing and other aspects of
the proposal, to be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company
as such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event of any amendment
to the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver to Parent and Merger Sub an additional
written Notice of Superior Proposal, and the four Business Day period
referenced above shall expire on the later of (x) three Business Days after
Parents and Merger Subs receipt of each such additional Notice of Superior
Proposal or (y) the original expiration date of the four Business Day period,
and (G) the Companys Board of Directors, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by
Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Without limiting
any other rights of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement in respect of
any such action, any withdrawal, modification or qualification by the Board of
Directors of the Company of the approval or recommendation of this Agreement,
the agreement of merger contained herein or the Merger or any termination of
this Agreement under _Section 7.01(g)_ shall not have any effect on the
approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing
Takeover Laws and Section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement to
be inapplicable to Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, which approvals and actions are
irrevocable, in each case to the extent permissible under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to do so would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
Law, or otherwise violate its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such action or disclosure may have any of the effects set
forth in _Section 5.02(d)_ or _Section 5.02(e)_ unless the Company shall
have first complied with its obligations in _Section 5.02(e)_.



 

36 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured to permit
such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of any material portion
of the assets (other than inventory purchased in the ordinary course of
business) of, or at least 15% of the capital stock, equity interest in, or
businesses of, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to
a merger, recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination, sale
of shares of capital stock or equity interests, sale of assets, tender offer
or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the
Merger and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced
by "50%") made in writing, in respect of which the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account the
legal, financial, financing and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, would result in a transaction that is (x) more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company
than the Merger (after taking into account any modifications to the terms of
this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub) and (y)
reasonably likely to be consummated without unreasonable delay.

Section 5.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Company will (i)
give Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized accountants, investment
bankers, counsel and other representatives reasonable access (during regular
business hours upon reasonable notice) to such employees, plants, offices,
warehouses and other facilities at reasonable times and to such
books, contracts, commitments and records (including Tax returns) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request and instruct the
Companys and its Subsidiaries independent public accountants to provide
access to their work papers and such other information as Parent or Merger
Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Merger Sub to make such
inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii) cause its officers and those
of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business, properties
and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may
from time to time reasonably request, (iv) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain when available consistent with past practice all unblinded
clinical trial data with respect to the clinical trials listed on _Section
3.17(e)_ of the Disclosure Letter, and the Company shall furnish all such
data to Parent promptly upon receipt, and (v) furnish promptly to Parent and
Merger Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during such period
pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access, inspections, data or other information to the extent that to do
so (w) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney
work product protection, (x) would violate a confidentiality obligation to any
Person, (y) includes files of outside litigation counsel or in-house counsel
with respect to the Pending Party Litigation (as defined below), or involves
access to or communications with the witnesses for the Company in the Pending
Party Litigation with respect to matters that relate to the Pending Party
Litigation, or (z) may otherwise be detrimental to the Company, including
with respect to its prosecution of the Pending Party Litigation, if the Merger
is not completed; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except with respect to the
Pending Party Litigation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any required  



 

37  consents to provide such access, inspections, data or other information and
take such other action (such as the redaction of identifying or
confidential information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other
agreement or by providing such access, inspections, data or other information
solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney client privilege) as
is necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information
to Parent and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable Law.

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Section
5.03(a)_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.04. _Stockholder Approval._ The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the
requisite stockholder approval required in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Except as specifically permitted by
paragraphs (d) and (e) of _Section 5.02_, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall continue to recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in
favor of the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in
Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders
the stockholder vote in favor of the adoption of the agreement of merger
contained in this Agreement required to consummate the Merger. Unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section 7.01_
(including, for the avoidance of doubt,  _Section 7.01(g)_), the Company
shall submit the agreement of merger contained in this Agreement to its
stockholders for adoption without regard to whether the Board of Directors of
the Company has withdrawn, modified or qualified, or has publicly proposed to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its
recommendation that the Companys stockholders adopt the agreement of merger
contained in this Agreement.

Section 5.05. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof.
Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts: (A) to make promptly any required
submissions under the HSR Act and any Foreign Antitrust Law which the Company
or Parent determines should be made, in each case, with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) to
furnish information required in connection with such submissions under the HSR
Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (C) to keep the other parties reasonably
informed with respect to the status of any such submissions under the HSR Act
or any Foreign Antitrust Law, including with respect to: (1) the receipt of
any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the
expiration of any waiting period, (3) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or
judicial action or proceeding under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton
Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law and (4) the nature and status
of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR

respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other  



 

38  transactions contemplated hereby and (D) to obtain all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals from
any Governmental Entity and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cooperate with one another: (A) in promptly determining whether any filings
are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other
supranational, national, federal, state, foreign or local Law or regulation or
whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or
instruments material to the Companys business in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others
of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
to such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a
Governmental Entity and (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Merger, _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not be required to take any of the actions described in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent that any Governmental Entity has
expressly requested or instructed Parent not to take any such action.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under
the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law
or if any investigation, litigation or other administrative or judicial action
or proceeding is commenced or proposed or threatened to be commenced
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the
HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and to
cooperate and assist the other parties in resolving, any such objections,
investigation or litigation, action or proceeding, and shall take such action
as may be agreed from time to time on behalf of Parent and the Company
regarding commitments and/or divestitures that may be made as a remedy in
certain product areas to certain antitrust authorities so as to permit the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date
(as defined below), in accordance with applicable Law (including the HSR Act,
FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act and any Foreign Antitrust Law).

contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

39 (e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets
(except in each case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date hereof),
if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, could reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable clearance, approval or
waiver under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.06. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree
that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ")
as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the
articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any agreement filed as an exhibit to a
Company SEC Document filed at least two Business Days prior to the date
hereof or listed on _Section 3.16_ of the Disclosure Letter, as in effect as
of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than the statutes of limitations applicable to
such matters.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause
to be maintained in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time,
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time,
policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may take the
form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering the
Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation will not be required, in order to maintain such directors and
officers liability insurance policies, to pay annual premiums in excess of
200% of the annual amount currently paid by the Company to maintain the
existing policies (which amount is $700,000); and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by
paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of 200% of such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain coverage in the
greatest amount and scope as can be obtained by paying aggregate annual
premiums equal to 200% of such amount.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has
been made against such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this _Section
5.06_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(d) This _Section 5.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal representatives. 



 

40 (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers of conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.06_. In addition , the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this  _Section
5.06_.

Section 5.07. _Employee Matters_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as
set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and
from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor all existing employment, retention and severance
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries specified in
_Section 3.09(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter, in accordance with the terms of
such agreements, including without limitation any provision providing for the
termination or expiration of such agreements following a Change in Control, as
such term is defined therein. From and after the twelve-month anniversary of
the Effective Time, officers of the Company shall be entitled to participate
in Parents current severance policy, as may be in effect from time to time,
to the same extent as similarly situated senior executives of Parent.

(b) From and for the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time,
except as provided herein Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(the " _Company Employees_ ") compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially similar, when taken together, to those provided to the Company
Employees in the aggregate immediately before the Effective Time pursuant to
the Plans (excluding for this purpose the Stock Plans or any other equity-
based plans); provided that stock-based compensation shall be comparable, in
the aggregate, to that offered by Parent and its Subsidiaries generally
pursuant to Parents and its Subsidiaries stock-based compensation plans as
may be in effect from time to time, to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent as determined by Parent in good faith.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companys Variable Incentive Plan (the
" _VIP_ ") and Key Contributor Incentive Plan (the " _KCIP_ ") shall remain
in effect through December 31, 2007. With respect to fiscal year 2008, the
Company shall implement a bonus plan (the " _2008 Bonus Plan_ ") on terms
similar to those of the VIP and KCIP, subject to the approval of, not to be
unreasonably withheld, Parent; _provided_ , that the 2008 Bonus Plan shall be
in effect through April 25, 2008, and any bonuses thereunder shall be pro
rated through such date, and following April 25, 2008, eligible Company
Employees who participated in the VIP and KCIP, and any successor plan, shall
participate in the applicable bonus plan maintained by Parent.

(d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Company Employees prior to the Effective Time to be credited
for all purposes under compensation, retention, severance and employee
benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other
than for purposes of benefit accrual or as would result in  



 

41  a duplication of benefits), to the same extent as such service was taken
into account under the corresponding plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and their respective predecessors) for those purposes. Company Employees and
their dependents will be immediately eligible to participate, without waiting
time, in any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to Employees to the extent such employee benefit plans replace
comparable Plans in which such individuals participated immediately before the
Effective Time and will not be subject to any pre-existing condition
limitation or actively at work requirements under any health plan of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which they
would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding plan of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which they participated prior to the Effective
Time. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to give such Company Employees credit under such plans for co-
payments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) in the event that the Effective Time occurs on a date
prior to January 1, 2008, make the bonus payments under certain of the
Companys bonus plans on the terms and conditions as set forth in Section
5.07(d)(i) of the Disclosure Letter, and (ii) effective as of the Effective
Time, adopt a severance plan for Company Employees on the terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 5.07(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt a sales force
retention plan for the benefit of is sales employees on the terms and
conditions as set forth in Section 5.07(e) of the Disclosure Letter.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent a true,
complete and accurate list of all employees that have been terminated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since March 1, 2007 and through the
Effective Time.

(g) No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Plan unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Plan. This shall
not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any
provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment
to such Plan. If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a
lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to such Company Employee Plan and that provision is construed to be
such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this
Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

Section 5.08. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to
exclude the applicability of, or to assist in any challenge by Parent or
Merger Sub to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

Section 5.09. _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC, with the assistance of and subject to prior consultation with Parent, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy
Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger as
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the  



 

42  information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement.
The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included
in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent with, and consult
with Parent regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its
staff with respect thereto, shall, subject to prior consultation with Parent,
respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the earliest reasonably
practicable date and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to
_Section 5.02_) to obtain the necessary approval of the Merger by its
stockholders. If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger), should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that
the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC, and to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. Except as _Section 5.02_ expressly permits, the Proxy Statement
shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
that the stockholders adopt the agreement of merger set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 5.10.  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which is reasonably likely (a) in the case of the Company, to
cause any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Sections
3.03_ , _3.04_ , _3.05_ , _3.10_ or _3.17_ of this Agreement (disregarding any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained therein) to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as of any time at or
prior to the Effective Time or (b) to result in any material failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties
receiving such notice.

Section 5.11. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and no settlement shall be agreed
to without Parents prior consent.

Section 5.12. _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to timely file with the SEC each form,
report and document required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act
and will promptly make available to Parent copies of each such report filed
with the SEC. 



 

43 Section 5.13. _Pending Party Litigation_. (a) Within one Business Day after
the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
litigation counsel to cooperate in good faith and prepare joint, stipulated
motions that request an immediate and complete stay of all proceedings in the
following civil actions: (i) Medtronic, Inc. et al. v. Kyphon Inc., civil
action number C06-02559 SI, venued in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California, and (ii) Harvinder Sandhu, M.D. and Harvinder
Sandhu and Kyphon Inc. v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. et al., civil action
number 05-2863 JPM/dkv, venued in the United States District Court, Western
District of Tennessee, Western Division (" _Pending Party Litigation_ ").

(b) Each joint, stipulated motion shall request, for each Pending Party
Litigation, (i) that the stay remain in force pending the closing of
the Merger or earlier termination of this Agreement, and (ii) in language
deemed agreeable by litigation counsel, that each court apply the stay
broadly, to encompass any matters presently pending before the court,
including the possible issuance of any further opinions or orders on matters
previously submitted for decision, in order to maximize the parties ability
to consummate the Merger.

(c) The Company, as the sole licensee to all inventions and patent rights of
Dr. Sandhu that relate to the Tennessee-venued litigation noted above, shall
(i) promptly procure Dr. Sandhus consent and cooperation in securing a stay
before the motion for a stay is filed, and (ii) have Dr. Sandhu join as a
party in the motion for stay.

(d) In the event that the court, in only one of the California- or Tennessee-
venued actions, denies the parties motion, Parent and the Company shall cause
their respective litigation counsel to cooperate in good faith and prepare a
joint, stipulated motion for reconsideration of the denial. If the motion for
reconsideration is denied, Parent and the Company shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to collaborate, and to cause their respective
litigation counsel to collaborate, on an alternative strategy to prevent the
unstayed litigation from advancing, in an attempt to realize the parties
joint intent not to have to litigate pending the earlier of Closing or
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the event such
collaboration fails to achieve a mutually agreeable result within thirty (30)
days from the denial of such motion for reconsideration, then both Parent and
the Company shall cooperate in good faith and prepare a joint, stipulated
motion to lift the stay in the action that was stayed and to seek the courts
guidance on other possible alternatives that would achieve the parties joint
intent.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.01_, either Parent or the Company may unilaterally request a lift of any
stay after providing the other party with five Business Days written notice
of its intent to so move the court. If the stay is lifted, either parent or
the Company may request a status conference and neither party shall oppose a
trial date set by the Court that is more than six months after the status
conference. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees not to oppose the
lifting of any stay requested under this section of the Agreement.

(f) Within three Business Days of the Effective Time, patent litigation
counsel for the parties and Dr. Sandhu shall cooperate in good faith
to jointly file papers in both of the Pending Party Litigations requesting
dismissal with prejudice of all claims, counterclaims and cross-claims (if
any).



 

44 Section 5.14. _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
or non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

Section 5.15. _Rule 16b-3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause disposition
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

merger contained in this Agreement by the holders of the Company) prior to the
Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being an effective
termination by Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or
taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.01(b)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and

_Section 5.05_ or otherwise in material violation of this Agreement;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate under this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill in any material respect any covenants and agreements
of such party set forth in this Agreement has caused or resulted in the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the End Date;

(d) by either the Company ( _provided_ that it shall not be in material breach
of any of its obligations under  _Section 5.02_) or Parent, if the requisite
affirmative vote of the holders of Shares in favor of the adoption of the
agreement of merger contained in this Agreement shall not have been obtained
at the Special Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each
case at which a vote on such adoption was taken;

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall have been a breach of any
of the covenants or agreements (including _Section 5.02_ and _Section 5.04_,
under circumstances in which Section 7.01(f)(i) is not applicable) or any of
the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach,
either individually or in the aggregate, would result in the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.02_ or _Section 6.03_, as the case may
be, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the
party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured;

(f) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have knowingly and materially breached
its obligations under _Section 5.02 _or _Section 5.04_, or (ii) the Board
of Directors of the Company shall have taken any of the actions set forth in
_Section 5.02(d)_ (i) through (iv) (or, in the case of  _clause (ii)_
thereof, resolved to take any such action), whether or not permitted by the
terms hereof;



 

47 (g) by the Company at any time prior to the adoption of the Agreement by the
requisite vote of the holders of Shares if, (i) the Company has determined
that a bona fide, unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Companys Board of Directors, after taking into
account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger
agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub following receipt of a Notice of Superior
Proposal, continues to believe that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (iii) on the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement for the transaction contemplated by such
Superior Proposal; provided, that the termination described in this _Section
7.01(g)_ shall not be effective unless and until the Company shall have paid
to Parent the Fee described in _Section 7.03(b)(v)_; or

(h) by Parent, if the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their
respective representatives shall have engaged in discussions with any other
Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal submitted in compliance
with the provisions of _Section 5.02_ that the Board of Directors has not
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section
5.02(e)_, and the Company, its Subsidiary and such representatives shall not
have ceased all discussions with such Person prior to the later of (i) the end
of the 30th Business Day following the first date of discussions with such
Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the end of the
10th Business Day following the first date of discussions with any other
Person in connection with another Acquisition Proposal submitted by such other
Person in compliance with the provisions of _Section 5.02_ prior to such
30th Business Day.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _clause (b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ or _(h)_ of this _Section 7.01_ shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with
_Section 8.04_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

Section 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Merger is abandoned pursuant to _Section 7.01_, this Agreement, except for
the provisions of _Sections 5.03(b)_ ,  _5.14_ , _7.02_ , _7.03_ and _Article
VIII_ , shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
on the part of any party or its directors, officers or stockholders. Nothing
in this _Section 7.02_ shall relieve any party to this Agreement of
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination.

Section 7.03. _Fees and Expenses_. (a)Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Fee if this Agreement is terminated
as follows:

(i) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.01(c)_ either (x) without the Special Meeting having been convened or (y)
with the Special Meeting having been convened but the requisite affirmative
vote of the holders of Shares not having been obtained at the Special Meeting,
(B) an Acquisition  



 

48  Proposal shall have been made public and not irrevocably withdrawn prior to
the date specified in _Section 7.01(c)_, and (C) any Alternative Transaction
is consummated, or an agreement in principle, letter of intent, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any Alternative
Transaction (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") is entered into, within
12 months after the date of such termination, then the Company shall pay the
Fee on the date of such consummation or the execution of such Company
Acquisition Agreement, whichever is earlier;

(ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.01(d)_ and (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
public and not irrevocably withdrawn prior to the taking of the vote at the
Special Meeting, the Company shall reimburse Parent for Parents reasonably
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) actually incurred by Parent on or prior to the termination of
this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Parent Expenses_ "), as directed by Parent in writing, which
amount shall not exceed $5 million; and if any Alternative Transaction is
consummated, or a Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, within 12
months after the date of such termination, then the Company shall pay an
amount equal to the Fee less the Parent Expenses on the date of such
consummation or the execution of such Company Acquisition Agreement, whichever
is earlier;

(iii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_ or _Section 7.01(f)(i)_, as the result of a knowing and material
breach by the Company of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company or its stockholders and not irrevocably withdrawn prior to the
occurrence of such breach, and (C) if any Alternative Transaction is
consummated, or a Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, within 12
months after the date of such termination, then the Company shall pay an
amount equal to the Fee on the date of such consummation or the execution of
such Company Acquisition Agreement, whichever is earlier;

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section
7.01(f)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the Business Day
immediately following such termination;

(v) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.01(g)_, then the Company shall pay the Fee prior to or simultaneously with
the termination; or

(vi) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_,
and any Alternative Transaction is consummated, or a Company Acquisition
Agreement is entered into, within 12 months after the date of such
termination, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the date of such
consummation or the execution of such Company Acquisition Agreement, whichever
is earlier. 

For purposes of this _Section 7.03(b)_, an " _Alternative Transaction_ "
means any transaction of the type referred to in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal and an "Acquisition Proposal" has the meaning specified
in _Section 5.02(g)(i)_ except that the references therein to "15%" shall be
replaced by "50%".



 

49 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amounts due pursuant to this  _Section 7.03_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount of the Fee set forth in this _Section 7.03_, the
Company shall pay to Parent Parents reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending
rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus
two percent per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid
until the date actually received by Parent. The Company acknowledges that it
is obligated to pay to Parent any amounts due pursuant to this _Section
7.03_ whether or not the stockholders of the Company have adopted the
agreement of merger contained in this Agreement.

Section 7.04. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made
which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights
of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, changed,
supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 7.05. _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. (a)At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
by any other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (iii) waive
compliance by any party with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude
the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by
such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights, power or
remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto
with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at
variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of
its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand
such compliance.

result in such representation or warranty or any other representation or
warranty contained in _Article III_ (other than those referred to in _clause

operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other

discovered that such holder engaged in the unauthorized removal from the
Company of any confidential document (in any medium or form) relating to
Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates or the customers of
Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates in violation of the

be deemed to have been terminated for Cause retroactively to the date the
events giving rise to Cause occurred.

(e) " _End Date_ " means February 26, 2008; provided however, that (i) if

respect of the Required Antitrust Clearances, (y) that all Required Antitrust
Clearances have been obtained, other than the Required Antitrust
Clearances arising under Foreign Antitrust Laws as are specified in such
certificate (the "Remaining Jurisdictions"), and (z) that based on the status
of the review process in the Remaining Jurisdictions, Parent in good faith
believes, taking into account the advice of its outside counsel, after
consultation with the Company and its outside counsel, that there is a
reasonable likelihood that all Required Antitrust Clearances in the Remaining
Jurisdictions will be obtained not later than April 26, 2008.

(g) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient of (A) the Merger
Consideration divided by (B) the average (rounded to the nearest whole cent)

the impact and nature of the employees duties, scope of responsibilities or
authority, relative to the impact and nature of the employees duties, scope
of responsibilities or authority as in effect immediately preceding
the Effective Time. The impact and nature of the employees duties, scope of
responsibilities or authority shall be determined based on objective metrics
such as revenue and/or budget responsibility, size of organization managed,
breadth of responsibility, and the like. A change in title or a change which
results in the holder not reporting to the individual or individuals serving
as holders supervisor or supervisors immediately before the Effective Time
shall not in and of itself automatically be construed as a material reduction
in the employees duties, scope of responsibilities or authority; (2) a
reduction in the employees base salary or target bonus opportunity, or any
failure to pay the employee any compensation or benefits to which the
employee is entitled; (3) without the employees express written consent, the
Companys or Parents requiring the employee to relocate employees primary
place of employment to any place outside a 40-mile radius from the employees
primary place of employment prior to such relocation, except for reasonably
required travel on the Companys business which is not materially greater than

general, (ii) changes, after the date hereof, in Law or GAAP, (iii) general
changes, after the date hereof, in the medical device industry, (iv) any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or war (whether declared or not
declared) or act of terrorism, (v) the announcement or the existence of,
or compliance with, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(vi) any change in the Companys stock price or trading volume, in and of
itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to such
change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining,
whether there has been, or will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (vii) the
failure of the Company to meet projections of earnings, revenues or other
financial measures (whether such projections were made by the Company or
independent third parties), in and of itself (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such failure may be deemed
to constitute, or be taken into account in determining, whether there has
been, or will be, a Material Adverse Effect), (viii) the pending U.S.
attorneys investigation relating to the Companys business, or the matters
covered thereby, (ix) the Pending Party Litigation, or (x) any investigation,
litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding that is

occurrence, change, event, effect or circumstance has a disproportionate
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared with
other companies in the medical device industry or (b) would, or would be
reasonably likely to, prevent or materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(l) " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, association, trust, estate or other entity or
