with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) the Offer

after the date hereof. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment
Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and to pay the Per Share Amount
for each such tendered and not subsequently withdrawn Share shall be subject
only to the Tender Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right
to waive any such condition, to increase the Per Share Amount payable in the
Offer, and to make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the
Offer; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the
Company (i) the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex A) may not be waived

be paid pursuant to the Offer, (B) decreases the Per Share Amount payable in

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open

(the "Expiration Date"), unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of
time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, this
Section 2.01(b) or as may be required by applicable Law, in which event the
term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as
so extended, may expire. Unless this Agreement or the Offer is terminated in
accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time
to time: (i) if the Minimum Condition is not satisfied on or before the
Expiration Date; (ii) if any of the conditions of the Offer set forth in
clause (ii) of the second paragraph of the Tender Offer Conditions are not

Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, and subject to the first sentence of

additional outstanding Shares.

such other documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto,

Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and

SECTION 2.03 Top-Up Option.

 

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the "Top-Up Option") to purchase up to that number of newly issued Shares

to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following
consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one Share more than 90% of the
Shares then outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (after giving effect to
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for consideration per Top-Up Option
Share equal to the Per Share Amount.

 

 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and
payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result
of which Parent and Purchaser own beneficially at least a majority of the
outstanding Shares. The Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if the number
of Shares subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized Shares available

thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and
Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be
upon the purchase of the Top-Up Options Shares, an "accredited investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the

or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262, except that Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 


 

perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.11, of
the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

 

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser (i) prompt notice of
any demand for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

 

 

SECTION 3.11 Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the holders of Shares and Company Stock Options to
receive the funds to which holders of Shares and Company Stock Options shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 3.06(a) and Section 3.07, respectively.
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation; provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating in excess of $500 million (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC
or otherwise).

 

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.06(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then
be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder
of such Certificate. If the payment equal to the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the certificate
so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender
such holder's Certificates because such Certificates have been lost,
mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit
and indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation. Each of Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of Shares such amount as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

(c) At any time following the ninth (9th) month after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law.

 

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law.

 

 

(e) All amounts payable by the Surviving Company in respect of Option
Payments and Restricted Stock Unit Payments shall be paid as provided in
Sections 3.07 and 3.08, respectively, above.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Except (A) as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule that has been prepared by
the Company and delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Disclosure
Schedule") (which Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections of this Article IV, and
any information disclosed in any such section of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed only for purposes of the corresponding
section of this Article IV, unless it is readily apparent that the disclosure
contained in such section of the Disclosure Schedule contains enough
information regarding the subject matter of other representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV as to clearly qualify or otherwise
clearly apply to such

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 


 

other representations and warranties) or (B) as disclosed in the SEC Reports
(as defined below) filed after January 1, 2007 and prior to the date of
this Agreement, other than any disclosure set forth in (x) any document
incorporated by reference in any such SEC Report and (y) any "risk factors"
section or in any section relating to "forward looking" statements, in each
case of such SEC Report, except to the extent that the applicability of such
disclosure to a section is readily apparent from such disclosure, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that:

 

 

SECTION 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

 

 

(a) Each of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (each a
"Subsidiary") is an entity duly incorporated, organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing or to have such power and authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

(b) A true, correct and complete list of each Subsidiary, together with the
jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and the percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary owned by the Company and
each other Subsidiary, is set forth in Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule. Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business association or entity.

 

 

SECTION 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each Subsidiary. Such
Certificates of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents
are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-
laws or equivalent organizational documents, except, in the case of any
Subsidiary, for violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION 4.03 Capitalization.

 

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000
Shares. As of May 1, 2008, (i) 18,808,528 Shares were issued and outstanding,
all of which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, (ii) no Shares are held in the treasury of the Company, and
(iii) 3,790,844 Shares are reserved for future issuance pursuant to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Company Stock Options or stock incentive rights granted pursuant to the
Company Stock Option Plans. Except as set forth in this Section 4.03, there
are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary. All Shares subject
to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified
in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
material outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or any capital stock of
any Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of
a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or any other
person.

 

 

(b) Each outstanding share of capital stock of, or other equity interest in,
each Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and each such share, or other equity interest in, is owned by
the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests,
liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on the Company's or any Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

 

 

(c) The Company has delivered to Parent a correct and complete list as of the
date set forth in Section 4.03(c) of the Disclosure Schedule of each option
and restricted stock unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested or exercisable) to purchase Shares issued under
any Company Stock Option Plan, which list includes the holder, date of grant,
exercise price (if applicable), number of Shares subject thereto, the Company
Stock Option Plan under which such option or restricted stock unit, as
applicable, was granted and, with respect to any option, whether the option
is vested and exercisable and with respect to any restricted stock unit,
whether the restricted stock unit is vested.

 

 

SECTION 4.04 Relative to This Agreement Authority.

 

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding Shares, if and to the extent required by applicable Law, and the
filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger and other documents as
required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
(including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 


 

effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in Section 5.06,
the Company has taken all appropriate actions so that the restrictions on
business combinations contained in each "fair price", "moratorium", "control
share acquisition", "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation enacted under Delaware law applicable to the Company
(the "Anti-takeover Laws"), including without limitation Section 203 of the
DGCL, will not apply with respect to or as a result of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, without any further
action on the part of the stockholders of the Company or the Board. True,
correct and complete copies of all resolutions of the Board reflecting such
actions have been previously provided to Parent. Other than Section 203 of
the DGCL, no Anti-takeover Law is applicable to, or purports to be applicable
to, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) The Board, at a meeting duly called and held and at which all directors
were present, has (i) unanimously approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Shares, and (ii)
approved the making of the Offer and resolved to recommend that stockholders
of the Company adopt this Agreement and that such matter be submitted for
consideration at the Stockholders' Meeting.

 

 

(d) The Board has duly and validly approved and taken all corporate action
required to be taken by the Board to grant the Top-Up Option and to issue the
Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise thereof. True, correct and complete
copies of all resolutions of the Board reflecting such actions have been
previously provided to Parent. Assuming that the authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in Section 4.05(b) and the filings referred to in
Section 4.05(b) are timely made, none of the grant of the Top-Up Option by
the Company, the exercise thereof by Parent and Purchaser or the issuance and
sale of the Top-Up Option Shares to Parent and Purchaser in respect of such
exercise, in each case, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.03, will
conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of, any provision of
applicable Laws or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of
any Governmental Authority, or require any action, consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Authority.

 

 

(e) A compensation committee or a committee of the Board that performs
functions similar to a compensation committee has duly and validly approved
and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board to (i) defer
the annual non-management director option grants, (ii) to grant the bonuses
to non-management directors at the December 2007 Board meeting in accordance
with Rule 14d-10 of the Exchange Act and (iii) except as set forth in Section
4.04(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, to cause management's employment or
change in control agreements to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
True, correct and complete copies of all resolutions of the committee
reflecting such actions have been previously provided to Parent.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(f) The affirmative vote (in person or represented by proxy) at the
Stockholders' Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding
Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, is (unless the Merger is
consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by
Section 7.01(b)) the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary necessary to adopt
this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 4.05 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
by the Company will not, (i) conflict with, violate or result in any breach
of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or any equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals and other authorizations described in Section 4.05(b)
and the approval of the holders of the Shares described in Section 4.04(f)
have been obtained and that all filings and other actions described in
Section 4.05(b) have been made or taken, conflict with or violate or
result in any breach of any federal or state statute, law, regulation,
judgment or decree (a "Law") applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien or other
encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease,
license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or a Subsidiary
or any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and consummation of the
Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, waiver authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any United States federal,
state or foreign government, regulatory authority, or any court, tribunal or
judicial body (a "Governmental Authority"), except for (i)
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the NASDAQ rules, state
securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and state takeover laws,
(ii) the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filings
under foreign competition laws, (iii) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger and other documents as required by the DGCL, and (iv)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, waivers authorizations
or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION 4.06 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
is in possession of all material licenses, permits certificates, and
approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company or
the Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties and assets or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits"). As of
the date of this Agreement, no suspension or cancellation of any of the
Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 


 

conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected or (b) any contract, Permit or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any property or asset of
the Company or any Subsidiary is bound, except for any such conflicts,
defaults, breaches or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION 4.07 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

 

(a) The Company has timely filed all forms, reports and documents required to
be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 2005 (the "SEC Reports"). No

statement, form, schedule or other document with the SEC. The SEC Reports

the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended,
as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

 

(b) The Company has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). The Company (i) has designed disclosure controls and
procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that information material to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relating to it and any Subsidiary is made
known to the management of the Company by others within the Company or any
Subsidiary as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act with
respect to the SEC Reports and (ii) has disclosed, based upon the
Company's most recent evaluation, to its auditors and the audit committee of
the Board (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have disclosed to its auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls
and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

Subsidiary has been advised of (i) any fact, circumstance or change that is
reasonably likely to result in a "significant deficiency" or a "material
weakness" (each as defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Auditing Standard 2) in the Company\'s internal controls over
its consolidated financial reporting or (ii)

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s internal controls
over its consolidated financial reporting.

 

 

(d) The Company and each of its officers and directors are in compliance
with, and has complied with, in each case in all material respects, the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations
promulgated under such act and the Exchange Act (collectively,
"Sarbanes Oxley") and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ that are
applicable to the Company. The Company's auditors and Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have given all certifications, attestations and
reports required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley.

incurred since December 31, 2007 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown, accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) except
for such liabilities and obligations which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

the aggregate, has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent

18  

 

 

 

 

 


 

or the consummation of the Transactions, and (c) none of the Company or
any Subsidiary has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement, would require the consent of Parent under Section 6.01.

continuing order of, or consent decree, settlement agreement or similar
written agreement with, any Governmental Authority, or any order, judgment,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority. No investigation or
inquiry by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in
each case with respect to any alleged or claimed violation of Law applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary, or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected.

(c) In the event that Parent's designees are elected or designated to the
Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board to
have at least two directors who are (i) independent directors for purposes of
the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the

director (or directors)

merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.05(a), if, prior to the purchase of Shares
pursuant to the Offer and following the receipt by the Company of a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal from any person, which Acquisition Proposal was
made after the date hereof and did not result, directly or indirectly, from a
breach of this Section 7.05, the Board determines in good faith, (i) after
consultation with its financial advisors and, with respect to the matters
covered by clause (iii) of the definition of "Superior Proposal" set forth
in Section 7.05(h), its outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to such
Acquisition Proposal, subject to compliance with this Section 7.05, and after
giving notice to Parent (x) furnish information with respect to the Company
to the person who has made such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Confidentiality Agreement and with a standstill of duration no shorter than
and with exceptions to such standstill not materially broader than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement"); and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding
such Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (in each case within two business days
of receipt thereof), specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and
the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the
Company shall provide to Parent (within such timeframe), a copy of all
written materials provided to the Company or any Subsidiary in connection
with any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company agrees that it and
the Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent. From and after the date hereof, the
Company shall notify Parent (within two (2) business days) orally and in
writing of any material modifications to the financial or other material
terms of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and shall provide to Parent,
within such timeframe, a copy of all written materials subsequently provided
to or by the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.05(d) and Section 7.05(f), neither the
Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, or resolve to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval
or recommendation by the Board of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, or
any Transaction; (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
whether taken by the Board or any committee thereof, a "Change in Board
Recommendation"); (iii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any
Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any
similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) effect any
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding Section 7.05(c), the Board may, prior to the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, in response to a Superior Proposal received by
the Board after the date of this Agreement, terminate this Agreement to enter
into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if:

 

 

(i) such Superior Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a
breach by the Company of this Section 7.05;

 

 

(ii) the Board shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that
it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal from any person, which notice shall attach the
most current version of any written agreement relating to the transaction
that constitutes such Superior Proposal, the identity of the party making
such Superior Proposal and any other material terms and conditions thereof
and shall cause the Company's representatives to negotiate in good faith with
Parent so that Parent may propose an amendment to this Agreement for the
purpose of causing the Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal;

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(iii) Parent does not make, within five (5) business days after the receipt
of such notice (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require
an additional notice to Parent and a new five (5) business day period), a
binding, written and complete (including any schedules or exhibits) proposal
that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors, causes the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

 

(iv) the Company pays the Company Termination Fee, under Section 9.03(b)
concurrently with and as a condition of such termination.

 

 

(e) The Company agrees that, during the period of five (5) business days
prior to terminating this Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal (and any subsequent five (5) business day period
pursuant to the parenthetical in Section 7.05(d)(iii) above), the Company
shall consider in good faith any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by Parent.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding Section 7.05(c), at any time prior to the purchase of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, if the Board has concluded in good faith,
following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Board to make a Change in Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Board may make a Change
in Board Recommendation.

 

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.05 shall prohibit the Board from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or is otherwise
required under applicable Law; provided, however, that, in any event, the
Board shall not be permitted to (i) make a Change in Board Recommendation or
(ii) take any position under Rule 14e-2(a) other than recommending rejection
of such tender or exchange offer, in each case, unless it has complied with
all of its obligations under this Section 7.05.

 

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal not solicited or initiated in violation of this
Section 7.05 that (i) relates to an acquisition by a person or group acting
in concert of either (A) more than 60% of the equity interests of the
Company pursuant to a tender offer, merger or otherwise or (B) more than 60%
of the assets used in the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) the Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company's
independent financial advisors) would, if consummated, result in a
transaction (A) that offers for each Share an amount in consideration greater
than the Per Share Amount and (B) that is, in light of the other terms of
such proposal, more favorable to the Company's stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, or in
any other proposal made by Parent after Parent's receipt of notice of a
Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel) is
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, in each case
taking into account all legal, financial,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of the proposal, including the
availability of financing and the likelihood that such transactions will
be consummated.

 

 

SECTION 7.06  Employee Benefits Matters.

 

 

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of one year immediately following
the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to provide (i) base salaries which are the same or greater
than the base salaries as of the Effective Time and (ii) benefits which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its subsidiaries. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that
are applicable to any current or former employee or director of the Company
or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries to continued employment by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation or
preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee for
any reason or (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to continue any employee benefit
plans or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time.

 

 

(b) Employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries shall receive credit for
all purposes (including, without limitation, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits but
not for purposes of benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans)
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective
Time with the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit.

 

 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 7.06 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including, without
limitation, any current or former employee of the Company or the
Subsidiaries, any participant in any Plan or any beneficiary thereof.

 

 

SECTION 7.07 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses than are set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law
and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each
present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of the
Company and each Subsidiary (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties")
against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action
or omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, for a period of six (6) years after
the date hereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay, in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received
and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided, further, that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section
7.07(b) to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any single action except to the extent that two or
more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action; and provided, further, that, in the event that any
claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six (6) year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue
until the disposition of such claim.

 

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six (6) years from
the Effective Time, if available, the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those
persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the
Effective Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and in amount, not less favorable to such individuals than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof (provided, that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers,
of at least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable,
including a "tail" policy); provided, however, that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.07(c)
more than an amount per year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance; provided, however, that in the event of an
expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies, Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as
is possible under substantially similar policies for such maximum annual
amount in aggregate annual premiums.

 

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.07.

 

 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.07.

 

 

SECTION 7.08 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall (i) prepare and make promptly its respective
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR
Act and applicable foreign competition Laws with respect to the Transactions
and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including, without limitation, using
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as
are necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger. In case, at any time after the
Effective Time, if any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all
such action.

 

 

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 7.08(a),
including the preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and,
if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder,
including, subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement,
providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and their
advisors prior to filing, and to the extent practicable neither of
the parties will file any such document or have any communication with
any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party.
Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of
any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Offer and the Transactions. To the extent practicable
and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall
permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and
calls with such Governmental Authority.

 

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Action, including
administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts,
prevents or prohibits consummation of the Transactions, including, without
limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative
and judicial appeal.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust or competition law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other person so as to enable
the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

reasonably practicable, including, without limitation, by seeking to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of any part or all of the Transactions, provided, however,
nothing in this section or in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the
Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries to agree to or take
any action that would result in any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Burdensome Condition" shall mean executing or carrying
out agreements (including consent decrees) or submitting to Laws (i)
providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories
of assets of the Company, Parent or their respective subsidiaries or the
holding separate of the capital stock of a Parent subsidiary or (ii) imposing
or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of the Company, Parent or
any of their respective subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses
(including, with respect to, market practices and structure) or own such
assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the
business of Parent, each of the Parent subsidiaries, the Company or the
Subsidiaries that, in the case of (i) and (ii), individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in (A) the sale or
divestiture of a material asset of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, (B) a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or a material adverse effect on Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, or (C) a
material adverse effect on the synergies which Parent reasonably expects from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case following
the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION 7.09 Public Announcements. Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree
that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions, the Offer
or the Merger shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as
such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of the SEC or any applicable securities exchange, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have
agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Offer and the
execution of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 7.10 Certain Notifications. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and Purchaser of
(i) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) any
notice or communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
(iii) any Action commenced or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against
the Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to Section 4.10 or which relates to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. Between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Company of any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of
Parent or Purchaser, threatened against Parent or Purchaser which relates to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, each party shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto in writing of (a) the occurrence, or
nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence, or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

nonoccurrence, of which would be likely to cause (x) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (y) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be
complied with or satisfied and (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.10 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

 

 

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

 

 

SECTION 8.01 Conditions to the Merger. The obligations of each party to
effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the
Effective Time, of the following conditions:

Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, this Agreement and the
Transactions shall have been adopted and approved by the affirmative vote of
the stockholders of the Company required by Law;

 

 

(b) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any

or prohibition (collectively, "Restraints") shall be enacted or in
effect preventing the consummation of the Transactions; and

 

 

(c) Offer. Purchaser or its permitted assignee shall have purchased all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; provided,
however, that this condition shall not be applicable to the obligations of
Parent or Purchaser if, in breach of this Agreement or the terms of the
Offer, Purchaser fails to purchase any Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

 

 

 

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

 

SECTION 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding any requisite adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company:

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 7.03(c), by mutual written consent of each of Parent
and the Company duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company; or

 

 

(b) By either Parent or the Company:

 

 

(i) if Purchaser or its permitted assignee shall not have purchased all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or before

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 

November 12, 2008 (the "Outside Date"), which date may be extended
to February 12, 2009 upon written notice of either Parent or the Company to
the other party on or prior to the Outside Date, provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose willful breach of a representation or warranty
in this Agreement or whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of Purchaser or
its permitted assignee to have purchased all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or before the Outside Date; or

 

 

(ii) if any Restraint preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable and has the
effect of making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.01(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final,
nonappealable Restraint was primarily due to or resulted from the failure of
such party to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(c) By Parent or Purchaser:

 

 

(i) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, a Material
Adverse Effect occurs with respect to the Company; or

 

 

(ii) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, there has
occurred a material breach of or material failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in any of the events set forth in clause (d) of Annex A to occur and
(B) is either incurable or, if curable, shall not have been cured prior to
the earlier of twenty (20) days following receipt by the Company of written
notice from Parent of such breach or failure to perform or the Outside Date,
provided, that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(ii) if Parent or Purchaser,
as the case may be, is in breach of this Agreement such that the Company
would then have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(d)(i); or

 

 

(iii) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board
shall have (x) effected a Change in Board Recommendation, (y) failed, after
receipt by the Company and public announcement of a Superior
Proposal, publicly to reaffirm its adoption and recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement within five (5) business days of receipt of a written request
by Parent to provide such reaffirmation, provided Parent has not made a
proposal to the Board pursuant to Section 7.05(d)(iii), in which event, this
period shall be extended by three (3) days, or (z) resolved to do any of the
foregoing;

 

 

(iv) due to a failure of the Tender Offer Conditions to be satisfied at the
Expiration Date, the Offer shall have expired or been terminated without
Purchaser having purchased any Shares pursuant thereto; provided, that Parent
or Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.01(c)(iv) if Parent's or Purchaser's breach of this Agreement
was directly or indirectly the cause of, or directly or indirectly resulted
in, the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 

failure of any of the Tender Offer Conditions to be satisfied or the failure
of Purchaser to have accepted for payment and promptly paid for all Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer; or

 

 

(v) if any Restraint imposing a Burdensome Condition shall be in effect.

 

 

(d) by the Company:

 

 

(i) if, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, there has
occurred a material breach of or material failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, if
curable, shall not have been cured prior to the earlier of twenty (20) days
following receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach
or failure to perform or the Outside Date, provided, that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.01(d)(i) if the Company is then in breach of this Agreement such
that Parent would then have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(ii); or

 

 

(ii) upon approval of the Board, if Purchaser shall have (A) failed to
commence the Offer within ten (10) business days following the date hereof,
or (B) the Offer shall have expired or been terminated without Purchaser
having accepted any or all of the Shares tendered for payment thereunder,
unless such action or inaction under (A) or (B) shall have been caused by
or directly or indirectly resulted from the failure of the Company to
perform, provided, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d)(ii) if the event referred to
in this clause directly or indirectly resulted from or was caused by the
Company's failure to perform in any material respect any of its obligations
under this Agreement or the failure of a condition set forth in clause (d) of
Annex A.

 

 

(iii) prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of Section 7.05(d) above
and provided, that, concurrently with such termination the Company pays to
Parent the Termination Fee and Deal Expenses payable pursuant to Section
9.03(b).

 

 

SECTION 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or
their respective officers or directors under this Agreement, other than (a)
the provisions of Section 4.21, the second and third sentences of Section
7.04(a), this Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X, which provisions
shall survive such termination, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve or
release any party from liability or damages arising out of fraud or any
willful or knowing breach hereof prior to the date of such
termination; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 9.03 Fees and Expenses.

 

 

(a) Except as provided in clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 9.03, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is
consummated, except that the filings fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the filing, printing, distribution and mailing of the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company.

 

 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(iii), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(iii) or (iii)(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly
known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i), Section 9.01(c)(iv),
or Section 9.01(d)(ii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the
Company enters into any agreement to consummate, or consummates, the
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether
such Acquisition Proposal is made before or after termination of this
Agreement), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $5 million (the
"Termination Fee") plus Deal Expenses of up to $1 million, by wire transfer
of same-day funds on the first business day following (x) in the case of a
payment required by clause (i) or (ii) above, the date of termination of this
Agreement, (y) in the case of a payment required by clause (iii) above, the
date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (iii)(C) above
and (z) the submission by Parent of a reasonably detailed list of its Deal
Expenses. "Deal Expenses" shall mean the cash amount necessary to reimburse
Parent and Purchaser on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand, as
applicable, and each of their respective affiliates for all reasonable out-of-

counsel, accountants, investment banking firms, experts, consultants
or financial advisors and their respective counsel and representatives)
incurred at any time (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) by
any of them or on their behalf in connection with the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement, including the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution, and performance thereof, their due diligence investigation of the
Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) In addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement or applicable Law, in the event that this

business day following the date of termination of this Agreement and the

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreement contained
in Section 9.03(b) and Section 9.03(c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
either party fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to Section
9.03(b) or 9.03(c) , and, in order to obtain such payment, a party commences
a lawsuit that results in a judgment against the other party for the
Termination Fee and/or Deal Expenses, as applicable, the party determined to
owe the Termination Fee and/or Deal Expenses, as applicable, shall pay to the
other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
the Termination

N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, plus three
percent (3%).

SECTION 10.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially

hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

 

SECTION 10.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 


 

except as set forth in Section 7.04(b), all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that
Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder to any affiliate of Parent, provided, that no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee
does not perform such obligations.

 

 

SECTION 10.05 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Sections 7.06 and 7.07
(which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and
may be enforced by such persons).

 

 

SECTION 10.06 Governing Law; Specific Performance.

 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed in that State. All actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby (i)
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery for the State
of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions
may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named court.

 

 

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to the
provisions of Section 9.03(b), which shall be the exclusive right and remedy
for the matters described therein provided the Company has complied with the
provisions of Section 7.05 and not otherwise breached any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement in this
Agreement, the parties agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, without bond or other security
being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Parent and Purchaser agree and acknowledge that
none of the directors, officers or affiliates of the Company shall have any
personal liability hereunder, including, without limitation, for any breach
of this Agreement or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty.

 

 

SECTION 10.07 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 


 

not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.07.

 

 

SECTION 10.08 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 10.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

under the Exchange Act, pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
and, subject to the terms of the Agreement, and only after complying with any
obligation to extend any Expiration Date as set forth in Section 2.01(b), may
terminate or amend the Offer, if (i) there shall not be validly tendered in
the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number

Parent and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, constitutes at
least a majority of the then outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis (the
"Minimum Condition"); (ii) any applicable waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the Offer or the Merger under the HSR Act shall not
have expired or shall not have been terminated or any filings or approvals
applicable to the Offer or the Merger of the competent competition authority

obtained prior to the Expiration Date; (iii) any Burdensome Condition shall
have been imposed in connection with obtaining any approvals or terminations
described in clause (ii) of this paragraph; or (iv) at any time on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of

Governmental Authority (i)(A) by any Governmental Authority that seeks
to impose a Burdensome Condition or (B) by a third party that is reasonably
likely to impose a Burdensome Condition; (ii) that is reasonably likely to
impose or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or Purchaser
to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any Shares, including the
right to vote any Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
or otherwise, on all matters properly presented to the Company's
stockholders, including, without limitation, the adoption of this Agreement
and the approval of the Transactions; or (iii) that is reasonably likely
to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the making or consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or the Transactions contemplated by Article III of
the Agreement;

 

 

(b) there shall have been (x) any judgment, order or injunction entered or
issued by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or (y) any
applicable Law promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by
any Governmental Authority that would, or is reasonably likely, directly or
indirectly, to result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) of clause (a) above;

 

 

(c) (i) the Board, or any committee thereof, shall have withdrawn or
modified, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or
recommendation of the Offer, the Merger, the Agreement, or approved or
recommended any Acquisition Proposal or any other

acquisition of Shares other than the Offer and the Merger or (ii) the Board,
or any committee thereof, shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing;

 

 

(d) (i) The Company shall not have performed all obligations and complied
with all covenants required by the Agreement to be performed or complied with
by it prior to the Expiration Date, in all material respects, and such
failure to perform or comply shall not have been cured prior to the
Expiration Date or (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Article IV of the Agreement shall not be true and
correct (without regard to materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
contained therein, except in respect of Section 4.09(b) of the Agreement,
where such qualifier shall be taken into account without duplication) as of
the date hereof and as of the Expiration Date as if made at and as of such
time (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date,
which shall be true and correct as of such specified date), except for where
the failure to be so true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, that the warranties in Sections 4.03 and 4.04 shall be true
and correct (taking into account and giving effect to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein) as of the date hereof
and as of the Expiration Date in all but de minimis respects (other than such
representations and warranties made as of specified date, which shall be true
and correct in all but de minimis respects as of such specified date);

 

 

(e) a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company shall have occurred;

Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the effect that the conditions set
forth in items (d) or (e) of this Annex A shall not have occurred and
continue to exist; or

 

 

(i) Other than filings pursuant to the HSR Act or filings or approvals of the
competent competition authority of any member state of the European Union,
any material consent approval or authorization of any Governmental Authority
required of Parent, the Company or any of their subsidiaries to consummate
the Offer or the Merger shall not have been obtained or shall have been
obtained subject to a Burdensome Condition.

 

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the foregoing
conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in
part, at any time, at the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser. The failure
by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

outstanding stock having not fewer than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. Prompt notice of the
taking of any such action shall be given to those stockholders who did not

meeting the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully
called or convened. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given,

INDEMNIFICATION AND  INSURANCE.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

6.1 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom
he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action or inaction in an official capacity or in any other capacity
while serving as director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the
General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended from time to time, against
all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys\'
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or
to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection therewith, and that indemnification shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however,
that, except as provided in section 6.2, the corporation shall indemnify any
such person seeking indemnification

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-6  

 

 

 

 

 


 

in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by that person,
only if that proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The
right to indemnification conferred in these by-laws shall be a contract right
and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, as amended from time to time, requires, the payment of such
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered
by that person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a
proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all
amounts so advanced, if it shall ultimately be determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under these by-laws or
otherwise. The corporation may, by action of its Board, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the corporation with the same
scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

 

 

6.2 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under section 6.1 is not
paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been
received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and,
if successful in whole or in part, the claimant also shall be entitled to be
paid the expense of prosecuting that claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, where the
required undertaking, if any, is required and has been tendered to
the corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct
that makes it permissible under Delaware law for the corporation to indemnify
the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the corporation
(including its Board, its independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is permissible in the circumstances because
he has met that standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by
the corporation (including its Board, its independent counsel or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met that standard of conduct, shall
be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has
failed to meet that standard of conduct.

 

 

6.3 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment
of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this section 6 shall not be exclusive of any other
right any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision
of the certificate of incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

 

6.4 Insurance. The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not
the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against that
expense, liability or loss under Delaware law.

 

 

6.5 Expenses as a Witness. To the extent any director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation is by reason of such position, or a position with
another entity at the request of the corporation, a witness in any action,
suit or proceeding, he or she shall be

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

indemnified against all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred
by him her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.

 

 

6.6 Indemnity Agreements. The corporation may enter into agreement with any
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation providing for
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.

 

 

       

7.

MISCELLANEOUS.

7.1 Seal. The Board shall adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in the form
of a circle and shall bear the corporation\'s name and the year and state in
which it was incorporated.

 

 

7.2 Fiscal Year. The Board may determine the corporation\'s fiscal year.
Until changed by the Board, the last day of the corporation\'s fiscal year
shall be July 31.

 

 

7.3 Voting of Shares in Other Corporations. Shares in other corporations
held by the corporation may be represented and voted by an officer of this
corporation or by a proxy or proxies appointed by one of them. The Board may,
however, appoint some other person to vote the shares.

 

 

7.4 Amendments. By-laws may be amended repealed or adopted by the
stockholders.
