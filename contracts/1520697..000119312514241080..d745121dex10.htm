Ladies and Gentlemen:

Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and each of the Guarantors (as hereinafter defined) hereby agree with you as
follows:

 

1\. _Issuance of Notes_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein contained,
the Company proposes to issue and sell to the several initial purchasers
named in _Schedule I_ hereto (the " _Initial Purchasers_ "), $300,000,000
aggregate principal amount of the Companys 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (each
a " _Note_ " and, collectively, the " _Notes_ ") in connection with the
offering and sale of the Notes as described herein (the " _Offering_ "). The
Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the " _Indenture_ "), to be
dated as of July 1, 2014, by and among the Company, the Guarantors (as
hereinafter defined) party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the " _Trustee_ "). Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated (" _Merrill Lynch_ ") and Jefferies LLC (" _Jefferies_ ") have
agreed to act as the representatives of the several Initial Purchasers (the "
_Representatives_ ") in connection with the Offering.

 

The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to
finance a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition (as defined
below) as described under the caption " _Use of Proceeds_ " in the Time of
Sale Document (as defined below). As described in the Time of Sale Document,
the Company has entered into a stock purchase agreement dated as of June 3,
2014 (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") with a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, Partnerships in Care Holdings Limited (" _Seller_ ") and The Royal
Bank of Scotland Public Limited Company (" _RBS Seller_ ") to acquire the
shares of Partnerships in Care Investments 1 Limited (" _PiC_ ") and
Partnerships in Care Property 1 Limited. The term " _Acquisition Agreement_ "
as used herein shall refer to all exhibits, schedules and attachments to such Page 2



 

 Acquisition Agreement. The term " _Acquisition_ " as used herein shall refer
to each of the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement. The
proceeds of the sale of the Notes are expected to be used, together with the
proceeds of (i) a line of credit available under the senior secured credit
facility as set forth in the Commitment Letter, dated as of June 3, 2014,
among the Company and Merrill Lynch and (ii) the issuance and sale of
approximately $375 million of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, to finance the Acquisition (collectively, the " _Financing_ "). The
Financing and the Acquisition are herein referred to as the " _PiC
Transactions_."

The Notes will be offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers pursuant
to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "
_Securities Act_ "). Upon original issuance thereof, and until such time as
the same is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Notes shall bear the legends substantially as set forth
under the " _Notice to Investors_ " section of the final offering memorandum,
dated the date hereof (the " _Final Offering Memorandum_ "). The Company has
prepared (i) a preliminary offering memorandum, dated June 17, 2014 (the "
_Preliminary Offering Memorandum_ "), (ii) a pricing term sheet, dated the
date hereof, attached hereto as Schedule II, which includes pricing terms and
other information with respect to the Notes (the " _Pricing Supplement_ "),
and (iii) the Final Offering Memorandum, in each case relating to the offer
and sale of the Notes (the " _Offering_ "). All references in this Agreement
to the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Time of Sale Document or the
Final Offering Memorandum include, unless expressly stated otherwise, (i) all
amendments or supplements thereto prepared by, or approved in writing by, the
Company, (ii) all financial statements and schedules and other information
contained therein (and references in this Agreement to such information being
"contained," "included" or "stated" (and other references of like import) in
the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Time of Sale Document or the Final
Offering Memorandum shall be deemed to mean all such information contained in,
or incorporated by reference into, such documents), (iii) any electronic copy
of the Time of Sale Document or Final Offering Memorandum and (iv) any
offering memorandum "wrapper" to be used in connection with offers to sell,
solicitations of offers to buy or sales of the Notes in non-U.S.
jurisdictions. The Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Pricing
Supplement are collectively referred to herein as the " _Time of Sale
Document_."

2\. _Terms of Offering_. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Company, and
the Company understands, that the Initial Purchasers will make offers to sell
(the " _Exempt Resales_ ") some or all of the Notes purchased by the Initial
Purchasers hereunder on the terms set forth in the Final Offering Memorandum
to persons (the " _Subsequent Purchasers_ ") whom the Initial Purchasers
reasonably believe are (i) " _qualified institutional buyers_ " (as defined in
Rule 144A under the Securities Act) (" _QIBs_ "), and (ii) are not " _U.S.
persons_ " (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) and in
compliance with the laws applicable to such persons in jurisdictions outside
of the United States.

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the
Companys U.S. subsidiaries signatory hereto (the " _Guarantors_ "). The
corresponding guarantees of such Guarantors are referred to herein as the "
_Guarantees_ " and, together with the Notes, the " _Securities_."

Holders of the Notes (including Subsequent Purchasers) will have the
registration rights set forth in a registration rights agreement applicable
to the Notes (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ ") to be executed on and
dated as of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). Pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will agree, among other things, to
file with the SEC (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act (the "
_Exchange Offer Registration Statement_ ") relating to notes to be offered in
exchange for the Notes (the " _Exchange Notes_ ") which shall be identical to
the Notes, except that the Exchange Notes shall have been registered pursuant
to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and will not be subject to
restrictions on transfer or contain additional interest provisions, (such
offer to exchange being referred to as the " _Exchange Offer_ "), and/or (b)
under certain circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ")
relating to the resale by certain holders of the Notes. If required under the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will issue Exchange Notes to the
Initial Purchasers (the " _Private Exchange Notes_ "). If the Company fails
to satisfy its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, it will be
required to pay additional interest to the holders of the Notes under certain
circumstances to be set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

This Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Exchange Notes are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Transaction Documents_ ", and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the PiC Transactions, are collectively referred to herein
as the " _Transactions_."

3\. _Purchase, Sale and Delivery_. On the basis of the representations,
warranties, agreements and covenants herein contained and subject to the
terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to
the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, and the Initial Purchasers
agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, the

following the satisfaction (or waiver) of all such conditions after

denominations as the Initial Purchasers may request, against payment by the
Initial Purchasers of the purchase price therefor by immediately available
federal funds bank wire transfer to such bank account or accounts as the
Company shall designate to the Representatives at least two business days

definitive form shall be made available to the Initial Purchasers for

will conflict with, violate, constitute a breach of or a default (with
the passage of time or otherwise) or a Debt Repayment Triggering Event under,
or result in the imposition of a Lien on any assets of the Company or any of
the Guarantors, the imposition of any penalty or a Debt Repayment Triggering
Event under or pursuant to (i) the Charter Documents, (ii) any Applicable
Agreement (including the consent to the issuance and sale of the Securities by
the "Majority WCP Investors" (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement, dated

order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award binding
upon or affecting the Company and the Guarantors, except, (A) in respect of
which a waiver or consent has been obtained prior to the date of this
Agreement or, (B) in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) only as would

Material Adverse Effect. After consummation of the Offering and the
Transactions, no Default or Event of Default will exist under any Applicable

Applicable Law that is enacted, adopted or issued, (ii) stop order suspending
the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Securities in
any jurisdiction that has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has

Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum, action, claim, suit, demand,
hearing, notice of violation or deficiency, or proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated by Governmental
Authorities or threatened by others (collectively, " _Proceedings_ "), that,

the date hereof and at the Closing Date, restrain, enjoin, prevent or
interfere with the consummation of the Offering or any of the Transactions or
(B) would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 
---|--- 



   (s) | _All Necessary Permits_. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries possess all licenses, permits, certificates, consents, orders,
approvals and other authorizations from, and has made all declarations and
filings with, all Governmental Authorities, presently required or necessary
to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and to
carry on its businesses as now or proposed to be conducted as described in the
Time of Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum (" _Permits_ "),
except where the failure to possess such Permits would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and the Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all of its
obligations with respect to such Permits, except where the failure to perform
such obligations would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred which
allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or
termination of any such Permit or has resulted, or after notice or lapse of
time would result, in any other material impairment of the rights of
the holder of any such Permit, except where such revocation or termination
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or the Subsidiaries has received
or has any reason to believe it will receive any notice of any proceeding
relating to revocation or modification of any such Permit, except as described
in the Time of Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum or except where
such revocation or modification would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.

has good and marketable title to all real property owned by it and good title
to all material personal property owned by it and good and valid title to all
leasehold estates in real and material personal property being leased by it
and, as of the Closing Date, will be free and clear of all Liens other than as
disclosed in the Time of Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum. The
real property, improvements, equipment and personal property held under lease
by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries are held under valid and enforceable
leases, with such exceptions as are not material and do not materially
interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such real property,
improvements, equipment or personal property by the Company or such
Subsidiary. 
---|--- 



   (u) |

_Tax Law Compliance_. All material tax returns required by applicable federal,
state or local law to be filed with any taxing authority by or on behalf of
the Company or any of 

---|--- 
 

 Page  12 



      |  its Subsidiaries have been duly filed when due (including any
applicable extensions) and all such tax returns are, or shall be at the time
of filing, true, complete and correct in all material respects. All material
taxes that are due from the Company and the Subsidiaries have been paid other
than those (i) currently payable without penalty or interest or (ii) being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
accruals have been established in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no actual or proposed tax assessments against the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect. The accruals on the books and records of the
Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of any material tax liability for any
period not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments of tax for
any such period. 
---|--- 



   (v) | _Intellectual Property Rights_. To the knowledge of the Company,

unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information,
systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, domain names and trade
names (collectively, " _Intellectual Property_ ") necessary for the conduct
of its businesses and, as of the Closing Date, the Intellectual Property will
be free and clear of all Liens, other than as disclosed in the Time of Sale
Document and the Final Offering Memorandum. The Company is not a party to, or
bound by, any options, licenses or agreements with respect to the intellectual
property rights of any other person or entity that are necessary to be
described in the Time of Sale Document or the Final Offering Memorandum to
avoid a material misstatement or omission and are not described therein. No
claims or notices of any potential claim have been asserted by any person
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries challenging the use of any
such Intellectual Property by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
questioning the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property or any
license or agreement related thereto, other than any claims that, if
successful, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as described in the Time of Sale Document and the Final
Offering Memorandum, none of the Intellectual Property used by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries has been obtained or is being used by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries in violation of any contractual obligation binding on
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or, to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries knowledge, its officers, directors or employees or otherwise in
violation of the rights of any person, other than any violations that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

respects with the presently

related charge, complaint, grievance, investigation, unfair labor practice
claim or inquiry of any kind, pending against the Company or the Guarantors
that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect;
and (viii) to the knowledge of the Company and the Guarantors, no employee or
agent of the Company or the Guarantors has committed any act or
omission giving rise to liability for any violation identified in subsection
(vi) and (vii) above, other than such acts or omissions that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. 
---|--- 
 



   (y) |

_Compliance with Environmental Laws_. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
(i) is in compliance with all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety (with
respect to hazardous or toxic substances or wastes), the pollution or
protection of the environment, hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
pollutants or contaminants (" _Environmental Laws_ "), (ii) has received and
is in compliance with all permits, licenses or other approvals required of it
under applicable Environmental Laws and (iii) has not received notice of, and
is not aware of, any actual or potential liability under Environmental Laws,
including for damages to natural resources or the investigation or remediation
of any disposal, release or existence of hazardous or toxic substances or
wastes, pollutants or contaminants, in each case except where such non-
compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive and comply with
required permits, licenses or other approvals, or liability would  

---|--- 
 

 Page  14 



      |  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries has been named as a potentially responsible party under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended, or any similar U.S. or non-U.S. state or local Environmental Laws
or is otherwise required by any Environmental Law to investigate or remediate
any pollutants or contaminants, except where such requirements would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary
course of business.  
---|--- 



   (z) | _Insurance_. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries have
insurance covering their respective properties, operations, personnel and
businesses, including business interruption insurance, which insurance is
in amounts and insures against such losses and risks as are prudent and
customary in the businesses in which they are engaged. All material policies
of insurance insuring the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full
force and effect. There are no material claims by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance
company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights
clause. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to believe
that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when
such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as
may be necessary to continue its business as now conducted and at a cost that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect. 
---|--- 
 



   (aa) | _Accounting System_. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries
make and keep accurate books and records and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls and procedures sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and to
maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
material differences. The interactive data in XBRL incorporated by reference
in the Time of Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum fairly present
the information called for in all material respects and are prepared in
accordance with the SECs rules and guidelines applicable thereto. Neither the
Company nor the Guarantors has any "material weaknesses" or "significant
deficiencies" (each, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), or is
aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a role in the internal controls of the Company or the
Guarantors (whether or not remediated) except as disclosed in the Time of
Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum in all material respects.
Since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls, there have been no material changes in
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.

its ability to pay as such debts and liabilities mature; (iv) the Company, on
a consolidated basis, is not engaged in any business or transaction, and does
not propose to engage in any business or transaction, for which its property
would constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due consideration to
the prevailing practice in the industry in which the Company, on a
consolidated basis, is engaged; and (v) the Company, on a consolidated basis,
is not otherwise insolvent under the standards set forth in Applicable Laws.

compromising, paying or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with
any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action in respect thereof;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , the Company and the Guarantors will not be liable
in any such case to the extent (but only to the extent) that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final, unappealable judgment
that such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense resulted solely from any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or

 

 Page  30 



 

 alleged omission made in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Time of
Sale Document, any Company Additional Written Communication or the Final
Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information concerning the Initial Purchasers
furnished to the Company by the Representatives specifically for use therein,
it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by
the Representatives to the Company consists of the information set forth in
Section 13 hereof. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8 shall
be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantors
may otherwise have.



   (b) | _Indemnification by the Initial Purchasers_. Each Initial
Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Company, each of the Guarantors and their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses to which the Company, such Guarantors or any such
affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become
subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as a
court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by a final,
unappealable judgment that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof) have resulted solely from (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Time of Sale Document or the Final
Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the
omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent (but only to the extent)
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
concerning the Initial Purchasers furnished to the Company by the
Representatives specifically for use therein as set forth in Section 13; and,
subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, will
reimburse, as incurred, any reasonable legal or other expenses (including the
fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in accordance with the provisions
of Section 8(c)) incurred by the Company, each of the Guarantors or any
such affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person in
connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action in
respect thereof. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section shall be in
addition to any liability that the Initial Purchasers may otherwise have. 
---|--- 



   (c) |

_Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures_. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action for which such
indemnified party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 8, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof in writing; but the omission to so notify the
indemnifying party (i) will not relieve such indemnifying party from any
liability under Section 8(a) or (b) above unless and only to the extent it is
materially prejudiced by such failure (through the forfeiture of substantive
rights and defenses) and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying
party from any obligations to any  

---|--- 
 

 Page  31 



      |  indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation
provided in Section 8(a) and (b) above. In case any such action is brought
against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it may elect, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified by written notice delivered to
the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (i)
the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii)
the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by
counsel that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action
or that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have
employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to
represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the
indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each
such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the
defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and
such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate
counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties
at the expense of the indemnifying party. After notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof and approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend
such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses, other than
reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the
indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however,
that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable
for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to
local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions
in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, designated by the Representatives in the case of Section 8(a)
or the Company in the case of Section 8(b), representing the indemnified
parties under such Section 8(a) or (b), as the case may be, who are parties to
such action or actions), (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in
writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of
the indemnifying party or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent
the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement
of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall
be at the expense of the indemnifying party and shall be paid as they are
incurred. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of
any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the
prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnified party waived in writing its
rights under this Section 8, in which case the indemnified party may effect
such a settlement without such consent.  
---|--- 
 

 Page  32 



    (d) | _Settlements_. No indemnifying party shall be liable under
this Section 8 for any settlement of any claim or action (or threatened claim
or action) effected without its written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, but if a claim or action settled with its written
consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff with respect to any
such claim or action, each indemnifying party jointly and severally agrees,
subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth above, to indemnify and
hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (and legal and other expenses as set forth
above) incurred by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested
an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses
of counsel as contemplated by this Section 8, the indemnifying party agrees
that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without
its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days
after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii)
such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in
accordance with such request or disputed in good faith the indemnified partys
entitlement to such reimbursement prior to the date of such settlement. No
indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any
settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party, or indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such
settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the indemnified
party, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B)
does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party. 
---|--- 



   (e) |

_Contribution_. In circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided
for in this Section 8 are unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless,
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof), each indemnifying party, in order to
provide for just and equitable contributions, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by
the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified
party, on the other hand, from the Offering or (ii) if the allocation provided
by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, not only such
relative benefits but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or
parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, in
connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand,
shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the
Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total
discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers. The relative
fault  

---|--- 
 

 Page  33 



      |  of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial
Purchasers pursuant to Section 8(b) above, on the other hand, the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omissions, and
any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. 
---|--- 



   (f) | _Equitable Consideration_. The Company, the Guarantors and the
Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution determined pursuant to Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata
or per capita allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not
take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(e).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser
shall be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate
exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by
such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any
damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged
omissions to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers obligations
to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several, and not joint, in
proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names
in Schedule I. For purposes of Section 8(e), each director, officer and
employee of an Initial Purchaser, and each person, if any, who controls such
Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as
such Initial Purchaser, and each director, officer and employee of the
Company and the Guarantors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company
or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to
contribution as the Company and the Guarantors. 
---|--- 

9\. _Termination_. The Representatives may terminate this Agreement at any
time prior to the Closing Date by written notice to the Company if any of the
events described in Sections 7(e) (No Material Adverse Change), 7(g) (No
Hostilities) or 7(h) (No Suspension in Trading; Banking Moratorium) shall
have occurred or if the conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof are not
satisfied or waived at or prior to the Closing Date. Any termination pursuant
to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of (a) the Company
or the Guarantors to the Initial Purchasers, except that the Company and the
Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Initial
Purchasers pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof, together with any other
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Initial Purchasers in
connection with the Offering, or (b) the Initial Purchasers to the Company or
the Guarantors, except, in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), that the
provisions of Sections 8 and 10 hereof shall at all times be effective and
shall survive such termination.

10\. _Survival_. The representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities
and contribution and expense reimbursement provisions and other agreements of
the parties hereto

 

 Page  34 



 

 set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and
in full force and effect, and will survive, regardless of (i) any
investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf
of such party, (ii) the acceptance of the Securities, and payment for them
hereunder, and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.

 

11\. _Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers_. If any one or
more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase
Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing
Date, and the aggregate amount of Securities which such defaulting Initial
Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase
does not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of the Securities to be purchased
on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in
the proportions that the amount of Securities set forth opposite their
respective names on Schedule I bears to the aggregate amount of Securities
set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or
in such other proportions as may be specified by the Initial Purchasers with
the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the
Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers
agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the Closing Date. If any one or
more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities
and the aggregate amount of Securities with respect to which such default
occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities to be purchased on
the Closing Date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers and
the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours
after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any
party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 5(f), 8 and 9
hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In
any such case either the Initial Purchasers or the Company shall have the
right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days
in order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum
or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Initial Purchaser_ " shall be deemed
to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under
this Section 11\. Any action taken under this Section 11 shall not relieve any
defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such
Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.

12\. _No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship_. The Company and the Guarantors
acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities
pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price
of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an
arms-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors, on
the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company
is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the
terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and
the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has
been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the
Company and the Guarantors, or their respective affiliates, stockholders,
creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Initial Purchaser has
assumed nor will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of
the Company or any Guarantor with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether
such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company or
any Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company or any
Guarantor except the obligations expressly set

 

 Page  35 



 

 forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that
involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors,
and the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such
interests by virtue of any fiduciary or advisory relationship; and (v) no
Initial Purchaser has provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax
advice with respect to the Offering, and the Company and the Guarantors have
consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the
extent they deemed appropriate.

 

13\. _Information Supplied by Initial Purchasers_. Each of the Company and the
Guarantors acknowledge that, for purposes of Section 4(d) and Section 8, the
only information that the Initial Purchasers have furnished to the Company
specifically for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum or the Final
Offering Memorandum are the statements set forth in the first sentence of
the fifth paragraph, the second and third sentences of the sixth paragraph,
the ninth paragraph and the nineteenth paragraph under the caption " _Plan of
Distribution_ " in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final
Offering Memorandum.

14\. _Miscellaneous._

   (b) | _Beneficiaries_. This Agreement has been and is made solely for
the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Company, the Guarantors, the
Initial Purchasers and to the extent provided in Section 8 hereof,
the controlling persons, affiliates, officers, directors, partners,
employees, representatives and agents referred to in Section 8 hereof and
their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, all
as and to the extent provided in this Agreement, and no other person shall
acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term
"successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser of any of the
Securities from the Initial Purchasers merely because of such purchase.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that each
purchaser who purchases Securities from the Initial Purchasers is intended to
be a beneficiary of the covenants of the Company and the Guarantors contained
in the Registration Rights Agreement to the same extent as if the Securities
were sold and those covenants were made directly to such purchaser by the
Company and the Guarantors, and each such purchaser shall have the right
to take action against the Company and the Guarantors to enforce, and obtain
damages for any breach of, those covenants. 
---|--- 
 

 Page  36 



    (c) | _Authority of the Representatives._ Any action by the Initial
Purchasers hereunder may be taken by the Representatives on behalf of the
Initial Purchasers, and any such action taken by the Representatives shall
be binding upon the Initial Purchasers. 
---|--- 



   (d) | _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial; Venue_. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York. Each of the Company, the Guarantors and the Initial
Purchasers hereby expressly and irrevocably (i) submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York in any suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) waives (a) its right
to a trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Transactions or any course of conduct, course of dealing,
statements (whether verbal or written) or actions of the Initial Purchasers
or the Company and the Guarantors, as applicable, and for any counterclaim
related to any of the foregoing and (b) any obligation which it may have or
hereafter may have to the laying of venue of any such litigation brought in
any such court referred to above and any claim that any such litigation has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
---|--- 



   (e) | _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement and supersedes all prior
written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and
negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof, including the Amended
and Restated Engagement Letter, dated as of June 9, 2014, between the Company
and Merrill Lynch, to the extent this Agreement is inconsistent therewith.
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each one of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. 
---|--- 
 



   (f) | _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 
---|--- 
 



   (g) | _Separability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and
the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to find and employ
an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as
that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is
hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they
would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable. 
---|--- 



   (h) | _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may be given, _provided_ that the same are in writing and signed by all
of the signatories hereto.

and each of the Non-Covered Guarantors, the due authorization, execution and
delivery of the Guarantee by each of the Non-Covered Guarantors and the due

and the Guarantors and the performance by the Company and the Guarantors to
the extent a party thereto of their respective obligations thereunder (other
than performance under the indemnification section of the Purchase Agreement,
as to which we render no opinion): (i) will not constitute a breach of,
or Default or a Debt Repayment Triggering Event under, or result in the
creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any Applicable
Contract, except for such breaches, defaults, liens, charges or encumbrances
as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

 



2  result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) will not result in any violation
of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
or the applicable Guarantor Governing Documents of any Covered Guarantor,
(iii) do not result in any violation of any Applicable Law or Applicable
Order, except for such breaches, defaults, liens, charges or encumbrances as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Effect. If an Applicable Contract is governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
other than New York, we have assumed such Applicable Contract is governed by
the laws of the State of New York.

 

(12) No consent, approval, authorization or other order of, any court or other
governmental authority, is required for the issuance and sale by the Company
of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers, or the consummation by each of the

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the
Trust Indenture Act and the security or "blue sky" laws of the various states
(and the rules and regulations thereunder), as to which we express no opinion
in this paragraph, or which have been obtained or made by the Company or the
Covered Guarantors, as applicable, and are in full force and effect under the
Securities Act.

 

(13) Assuming (i) the accuracy and completeness of the representations,
warranties and covenants of the Company, the Guarantors, and the Initial
Purchasers contained in the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the compliance with the
procedures set forth in the Trust Indenture Act in the manner contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement and the OM, and (iii) that the Initial Purchasers have
a reasonable belief that the purchasers who buy such Notes in the initial
resale thereof are "qualified institutional buyers" as defined in Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act, or persons other than "U.S. persons" in
connection with offers and sales made in reliance upon Regulation S under the
Securities Act, no registration under the Securities Act of the Notes is
required in connection with the purchase of the Notes by the Initial
Purchasers or in connection with the initial resale of the Notes by the
Initial Purchasers in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and
the OM. We express no opinion, however, as to when or under what circumstances
any Notes initially sold by the Initial Purchasers may be reoffered or
resold.

(14)(a) The statements in the OM under the headings "Description of the
Notes", "Exchange Offer", and "Description of Other Indebtedness", insofar as
such statements constitute matters of law, summaries of legal matters, the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaw provisions, documents, or
legal proceedings, have been reviewed by us and fairly present and summarize,
in all material respects, the matters referred to therein.

(b) The statements in the OM under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Considerations", insofar as such statements constitute matters of law,
summaries of legal matters, or legal conclusions, have been reviewed by us and
fairly present and summarize, in all material respects, the matters referred
to therein.

(15) The legal statements in the materials relating to Health Care Laws
encompassed under the captions set forth in _Schedule D_ hereto, insofar as
such statements constitute overviews or summaries of the laws and regulations
referred to therein, including the qualifications set forth therein, fairly
present and summarize, in all material respects, such laws and regulations
referred to therein.

 



3 (16) Neither the Company nor any Guarantor is, or, after giving effect to the
offering and sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the application
of the proceeds thereof as described in the OM under the caption "Use of
Proceeds", will be required to register as an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(17) There is no legal or governmental proceeding pending to which the Company
or any Guarantor is a party that has caused us to conclude that such
proceeding would be required to be described by Item 103 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act if the issuance of the Notes and the Guarantee was
being registered under the Securities Act, but is not so described in the OM.

(18) The documents incorporated by reference in the OM (other than the
financial statements, any notes thereto, schedules, and other financial or
statistical information derived therefrom and included therein or omitted
therefrom, including without limitation such financial or statistical
information provided in an interactive data format using XBRL or any
statements made in the exhibits thereto, as to which we express no opinion),
when they were filed with the SEC, complied as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

We have not verified, are not passing upon and do not assume any
responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the
statements contained in the Time of Sale Document or the Final Offering
Memorandum, except as stated in paragraphs 14, 15 and 17 above. We have
participated, however, in the preparation of the OM during the course of which
preparation we examined various documents and other papers and participated
in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company and
Partnerships in Care Investments 1 Limited ("PiC") and representatives of the
Companys and PiCs independent registered public accounting firm, and your
representatives and counsel, at which conferences the contents of the OM,
including all documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed incorporated
by reference therein, were discussed, reviewed and revised. On the basis of
the information that was developed in the course of our participation,
considered in light of our understanding of applicable law and the experience
we have gained through our practice, no facts have come to our attention that
lead us to believe that the Time of Sale Document (including any document
filed under the Exchange Act and deemed incorporated by reference therein) at
the Applicable Time or that the Final Offering Memorandum (including any
document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed incorporated by reference
therein) as of its date and the date hereof contained or contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except
that in each case we do not make any statement as to the financial statements,
any notes thereto, schedules and other financial or statistical information
derived therefrom and included in or incorporated by reference into or omitted
from the Time of Sale Document and the Final Offering Memorandum, including,
without limitation, such financial or statistical information provided in an
interactive data format using XBRL or any statements made in the exhibits
thereto).
