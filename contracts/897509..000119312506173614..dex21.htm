-10- make payments of Consideration to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Promptly after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any of such shares in
exchange for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
such certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the Surviving
Corporation shall promptly cause the Paying Agent to pay to each person
entitled thereto a check in the amount of the Consideration to which such
person is entitled, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount payable upon the surrender
of any such certificate. If payment is to be made to a person other than the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of
such payment that the certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. One
hundred and eighty days following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto)
made available to the Paying Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
on the Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the cash payable upon due surrender of their certificates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any holder of certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

3.04 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Dissenters Shares shall be purchased and paid
for in accordance with Sections 14-2-1301 to 1332 of the GBCC. The Company
shall give the Acquiror (a) prompt notice of any written demands for fair
value received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
related instruments served pursuant to the GBCC and received by the Company
and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for fair value under the GBCC. The Company shall not,
except with prior written consent of the Acquiror, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenters Shares or
offer to settle, or settle, any such demands.

3.05 _Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option then outstanding, without any action on the part of the holder, shall
be converted into the right to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to
the product of (1) the excess of the Consideration over the exercise price
per share, if any, of such Company Stock Option and (2) the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective



 

-11- Time; _provided_ that the Company shall be entitled to withhold from such cash
payment any amounts required to be withheld by applicable law. As a condition
to the right to receive such payment, each holder shall deliver to the
Acquiror an acknowledgement and waiver (in form and substance reasonably to be
mutually agreed by the Acquiror and the Company prior to the Effective Time)
that (i) confirms the cash amount to which such holder is entitled under such
holders Company Stock Options and (ii) releases the Company, the Acquiror and
their respective affiliates, and the officers, directors and employees of the
foregoing, from any and all claims relating to the Company Stock Options upon
payment of the cash amount due. Each Company Stock Option to which this
paragraph applies will be cancelled by the Company and shall cease to
exist automatically as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall take all necessary actions, including adopting resolutions of
the Company Board, of the board of directors of the Bank or of a committee
established under a Company Stock Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock
Resolutions_ "), if applicable, to effect the foregoing.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys
knowledge, any other party thereto is in default under any such Contract, and
there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving
of notice or both, would constitute such a default. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has waived or repudiated any material provision of any

(n) _Employee Benefit Plans_. (1) The Company has Previously Disclosed a

-23- contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of
current or former officers, employees or directors or the beneficiaries or
dependents of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Compensation Plans_
") other than plans, programs or arrangements that cost less than $50,000 per
annum to maintain in the aggregate.

 

(2) With respect to each Compensation Plan, if applicable, the Company has
provided to the Acquiror, true and complete copies of the existing: (A)
Compensation Plan documents and amendments thereto; (B) trust instruments and
insurance contracts; (C) with respect to any employee stock ownership plan,
any loan agreements and (D) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with the U.S.
Department of Labor.

(3) Except as Previously Disclosed, each of the Compensation Plans has
been administered and operated in material compliance with the terms thereof
and with applicable law, including ERISA, the Code and the Securities Act.
Except as Previously Disclosed, each of the Compensation Plans that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(" _Pension Plan_ ") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
IRS (or may rely upon a favorable determination letter issued to the sponsor
of a master, prototype, or volume submitter arrangement) covering all tax law
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within the
applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and the
Company is not aware of any circumstances that would likely result in the
revocation or denial of any such favorable determination letter or the loss
of the qualification of such Compensation Plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or to the knowledge of the
Company an Indemnified Party has engaged in any transaction with respect to
any Compensation Plan that has subjected, or (assuming the taxable period with
respect to the transaction expired as of the date hereof) could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be
material. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Except as Previously Disclosed,
there is no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened litigation or
governmental audit, examination or investigation relating to the Compensation
Plans.

(4) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any "single-employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001
(a)(15) of ERISA) or Multiemployer Plan currently or formerly maintained or
contributed to by any of them, or the single-employer plan or Multiemployer
Plan of any entity (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") that is considered one employer
with the Company under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c)
of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate Plan_ "). No notice of a "reportable
event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to
PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been



 

-24- required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the
12-month period ending on the date hereof. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan, and, to the
Companys knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk that
such proceedings will be instituted. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect
to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).

 

(5) Except as Previously Disclosed, all contributions, premiums and payments
required to have been made under the terms of any of the Compensation Plans
or applicable law have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Compensation Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the financial
statements contained in the Companys SEC Documents. Neither any of the
Pension Plans nor ERISA Affiliate Plans has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
Pension Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) or
Section 412(n) of the Code.

(6) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior
to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the plans
most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of
the assets of such plan. Under each of the Pension Plans, there has been no
adverse change in the financial condition of any Pension Plan (with respect to
either assets or benefits) since the last day of the most recent plan year.

(7) There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, litigation relating to the Compensation Plans. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health
and life benefits under any Compensation Plan, except as Previously Disclosed.
The Company or the Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any
time without incurring any liability thereunder. Except as Previously
Disclosed, there has been no communication to employees, former employees or
their spouses, beneficiaries or dependents by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that promised or guaranteed such employees retiree health or life
insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis or promised or
guaranteed that any such benefits could not be modified, eliminated or
terminated. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have no liability with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than as an employee, or with respect to
any employee leased from another employer.

(8) Except as Previously Disclosed, there has been no amendment to,
announcement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any Compensation Plan which would
materially increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the



 

-25- level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recently ended fiscal
year. Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (v) entitle any employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (w) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase
the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any
of the Compensation Plans, (x) limit or restrict the right of the Company to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Compensation Plans, (y) cause the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to record additional compensation expense on its
income statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other equity-
based award or (z) result in payments under any of the Compensation Plans
which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the
Code.

(9) The Company has Previously Disclosed a complete list stating the current
base salary, 2005 earned incentive compensation and 2006 target incentive
compensation, and additional payments triggered by the Merger and the
Companys estimate of the excise tax gross-up for each such amount for all
current officers, employees and directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(10) Since December 31, 2005, the Company has not taken any action which, if
taken after the date hereof, would be prohibited by Sections 4.01(f) and (g).

(o) _Labor Matters_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, including
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, any such laws respecting
employment discrimination, disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity,
affirmative action, workers compensation, employee benefits, severance
payments, labor relations, employee leave issues, wage and hour
standards, occupational safety and health requirements and unemployment
insurance and related matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or is bound by any collective bargaining Contract with a labor
union or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any such Subsidiary has
committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company or any such Subsidiary to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment,
nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, nor is the
Company aware of any activity involving it or any of its Subsidiaries
employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other
organizational activity. The consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not entitle any third party
(including any labor union or labor organization) to any payments under any
Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party. The
Company has not incurred any liability or obligation under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ "), or any similar state or local
law which remains unsatisfied.

right of termination under, any law, rule or regulation or any judgment,
decree, order, governmental permit or license, or Contract of the Acquiror or
of any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound, (B) constitute a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Constitutive Documents of the Acquiror
or any of its Subsidiaries or (C) require any consent or approval under any
such law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or
license or Contract.

(e) _Funds_. At the Effective Time, the Acquiror will have the funds
necessary to consummate the Merger and pay the Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(f) _Interim Operations of Acquiror Sub_. Acquiror Sub will be formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and, as of
the Closing Date, will have engaged in no business other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Acquiror Sub will be a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror.



 

-31- (g) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by the Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a
brokerage commission, finders fee or other, like payment with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that the Acquiror has
employed SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in connection with this transaction.

(h) _Litigation_. No litigation, claim or other proceeding before any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending against the Acquiror or any
of its Subsidiaries and, to the Acquirors knowledge, no such litigation,
claim or other proceeding has been threatened, that would materially impair
the ability of the Acquiror to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or otherwise materially threaten or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(i) _Disclosure_. The information Previously Disclosed or otherwise provided
to the Company in connection with this Agreement, when taken together with
the representations and warranties contained herein, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

6.01  _Reasonable Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Company and the Acquiror agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or
advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as
promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with, and furnish
information to, the other party hereto to that end.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.01(a), the Company agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or approval of all
persons party to a Contract with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to
the extent such consent or approval is required in order to consummate the
Merger or for the Surviving Corporation to receive the benefits of such
Contract.

6.02 _Shareholder Approvals._ The Company agrees to take, in accordance with

by the



 

-32- Companys shareholders for consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or postponement, the "
_Company Meeting_ "), and to solicit shareholder approval, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof. The Company Board has adopted a resolution
contemplated by GBCC Section 14-2-1103 recommending that the shareholders
approve this Agreement (and will keep such resolution in effect) and take any
other action required to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The obligation of the Company to hold the Company Meeting shall not
be affected by any Acquisition Proposal or other event or circumstance and the
Company agrees that it will not submit any Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders for a vote, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms.

6.03 _Proxy Statement_. (a) The Acquiror and the Company will cooperate in the
preparation of a proxy statement and other proxy solicitation materials of
the Company (the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Acquiror agrees to provide as
promptly as reasonably practicable all necessary information for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees to file the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. The
Company will advise the Acquiror promptly of the time when the Proxy Statement
and any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement has been filed, and of
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional

consultation with the Acquiror, to respond promptly to all such comments of
and requests by the SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other
party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and each
party will provide the other party with a copy of such filings with the SEC.

(b) Each of the Company and the Acquiror agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement that, at
the time and in the light of the circumstances under which such statement is
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
false or misleading or necessary to correct any earlier statement in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of the Company and
the Acquiror further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the
Effective Time of any information furnished by it that would cause any of the
statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein not false or misleading, to inform promptly the other
party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press
release in such form agreed to in advance by the parties, and thereafter each
of the Company and the Acquiror agrees that it will not, without the prior
approval of the other party, issue any press release or written statement for
general circulation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby (except
for any release or statement that is required by law or regulation and as to
which the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be, has used its best
efforts to discuss with the other in advance, provided that such release or
statement has not been caused by, or is not the result of, a previous
disclosure by or at the direction of the Company or the Acquiror, as the case
may be, or any of its representatives that was not permitted by this
Agreement).

6.05 _Access; Information._ (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall
afford the Acquiror and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives, such access during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records
(including credit files, Tax returns and work papers of independent auditors),
properties, personnel and to such other information as it may reasonably
request and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly (1) a
copy of each material report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant
to the requirements of federal or state securities or banking laws and (2) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
Acquiror may reasonably request.

(b) Each of the Company and the Acquiror agrees that it will not, and will
cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.05 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of
law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to
keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.05, and, with respect to the Company, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, unless such information (1) was already
known to such party, (2) becomes available to such party from other sources
not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (3) is
disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such
information pertains, (4) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published
information or trade sources or (5) is such that such party is required by law
or court order to disclose. If either party is required or reasonably
believes that it is required to disclose any information described in this
section by (i) law, (ii) any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) any
inquiry or investigation by any governmental, official or regulatory body
which is lawfully entitled to require any such disclosure, such party (the "
_Required Party_ ") shall, so far as it is lawful, notify the other party of
such required disclosure on the same day that the Required Party (a)
is notified of a request for such disclosure from the relevant authority,
body or other entity or (b) determines that such disclosure is required,
whichever is earlier. Immediately thereafter, and to the extent practical on
the same day, and subject to applicable laws, the parties shall discuss and
use their reasonable best efforts to agree as to the mandatory nature, the
required timing and the required content of such disclosure. The Required
Party will furnish only that portion of the information described in this
section that is legally required to be disclosed and will



 

-34- exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain an order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information
described in this section so furnished. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise
fail to be consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of
documents or extracts thereof containing information and data as to another
party hereto to be returned to the party which furnished the same, or at the
other partys request, destroyed.

(c) No investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the other
shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to
either partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any person to whom the Company has provided documents,
data or other materials relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the consideration of any business combination involving the
Company to return or destroy any such documents, files, data or other
materials in accordance with the confidentiality agreement between the Company
and such person.

6.06 _Acquisition Proposals._ The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries representatives not to,
solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect
to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any
tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest
in, or a substantial portion of the business, assets or deposits of, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (any of the foregoing, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ");
_provided_  that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; (ii) before the date
of the Company Meeting, providing (or authorizing the provision of)
information to, or engaging in (or authorizing) such discussions or
negotiations with, any person who has made a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal received after the date hereof which did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.06; or (iii) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to its
shareholders if and only to the extent that, in the case of actions referred
to in clause (ii) or (iii), (x) such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, (y) the Company Board, after having consulted with and considered
the advice of outside counsel to the Company Board, determines in good
faith that providing such information or engaging in such negotiations or
discussions, or making such recommendation is required in order to discharge
the directors fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders in
accordance with the GBCC and (z) the Company receives from such person making
such Acquisition Proposal a confidentiality agreement substantially in the
form of the Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "
_Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal by a third party on
terms that the Company Board determines



 

-35- in its good faith judgment, after receiving the advice of its financial and
legal advisors (including with respect to prospects for approvals by
Governmental Authorities), to be materially more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Company and its shareholders than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein, taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing
terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and
any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law, after giving the
Acquiror at least five business days to respond to such third-party
Acquisition Proposal once the Board has notified the Acquiror that in the
absence of any further action by the Acquiror it would consider such
Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, and then taking into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Acquiror. The
Company also agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of
this Agreement with any parties other than the Acquiror, with respect to any
of the foregoing. The Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise the
Acquiror following the receipt by it of any Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and advise the Acquiror of any developments (including
any change in such terms) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly
upon the occurrence thereof. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of or
release any of its rights under any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it is a party. The Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including, but not limited to, by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction.

Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or any other provision of this
Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from notifying any
third party that contacts the Company on an unsolicited basis after the date
hereof concerning an Acquisition Proposal of the Companys obligations under
this Section 6.06.

6.07 _Takeover Laws and Provisions._ No party hereto shall knowingly take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from,
or if necessary challenge the applicability or validity of, any purportedly
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. No party hereto shall
knowingly take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated
hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions and each of them shall take
all necessary steps within its control to make those transactions comply with
(or continue to comply with) the Takeover Provisions.

6.08 _No Rights Triggered._ The Company shall take all reasonable steps
necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or



 

-36- combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not
and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person (a) under the
Constitutive Documents of the Company or (b) under any material Contract to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except, in each case, as
Previously Disclosed or contemplated by this Agreement. 

6.09 _Regulatory Applications._ (a) The Acquiror and the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Acquiror and the Company
will promptly file applications, notices or other materials required to be
filed with Governmental Authorities by applicable law in connection with the
Merger and promptly file any additional information requested as soon as
practicable after receipt of request thereof. Each party shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable to consult with the other
party, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party
or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, the parties agree to
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of the Acquiror and the
Company agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect
to the obtaining of all material consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of
material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) Each of the Acquiror and the Company agrees, upon request, to furnish the
other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority.

6.10 _Indemnification._ (a) Following the Effective Time and for a period of
six years thereafter, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time (each, a " _Claim_ "), to the fullest extent that the Company is
permitted to indemnify its directors and officers under applicable law and its
Constitutive Documents in effect on the date hereof (and the Acquiror shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the person to
whom expenses are



 

-37- advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification); _provided_
that any determination required to be made with respect to whether such an
officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable law and the Companys Constitutive Documents shall be made by
independent counsel reasonably acceptable to both the Indemnified Party and
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) For a period of three years from the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide) that portion of directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and officers
arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, which
insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided
by the Company; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Acquiror be
required to expend more than twice the current amount spent by the Company
(the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure such directors and
officers insurance coverage; _provided, further,_ that if the Acquiror is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.10(b),
the Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
_provided, further,_ that officers and directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the Acquirors insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.10(a), upon learning of a Claim, shall promptly notify the Acquiror
thereof; _provided_ that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Acquiror under Section 6.10(a) unless and to the extent
that the Acquiror is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. In the
event of a Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (1)
the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Acquiror shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between the
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided, however,_ that the Acquiror shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (2) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (3)
the Acquiror shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
_provided, further,_  that the Acquiror shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction



 

-38- shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

(d) If the Acquiror or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquiror
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to benefit, and may be
enforced by, all Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
representatives.

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters._ (a) Each of the Company and the
Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event
or circumstance known to it that would reasonably be expected, individually
or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it,
(1) to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein without giving effect to
any Material Adverse Effect qualifications.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify the Acquiror of any written notice or
other bona fide communication from any person alleging that the consent
of such person is or may be required as a condition to the Merger.

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the
Closing Date, notify its insurers in writing of all known incidents, events
and circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim
against the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

6.12 _Employee Benefits._

(a) The Acquiror agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with pension and welfare
benefits under employee benefit plans that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will cease participation
in the Companys benefit programs and become eligible members of the
Acquirors or its Affiliates benefit programs.

(b) The Acquiror will cause each employee benefit plan of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, the prior service
of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service
were with Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such
service was credited



 

-39- under a comparable plan of the Company. The Acquiror will (1) waive any
preexisting condition and waiting periods under employee benefit plans
applicable to the Acquiror in which the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are eligible to participate (other than requirements that become
applicable because the employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries seeks to
increase the scope or level of his or her benefits) and (2) cause such
employee benefit plans to honor any expenses incurred by the employee and his
or her beneficiaries under similar plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
during the portion of the calendar year in which he or she became an employee
of the Acquiror for purposes of satisfying applicable calendar year
deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket expenses, coordinated with the employee
benefit plans of the Acquiror, as appropriate. Employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will retain credit for vacation pay which has been accrued as
of the Effective Time and for purposes of determining the entitlement of such
employees to vacation pay following the Effective Time, the service of such
employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be treated as if such
service was with Acquiror and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate the FLAG Financial Corporation Retirement Plan effective as of
the day prior to the Closing Date, including adopting resolutions of the
Company Board.

(d) The Company shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all
notifications, benefits and liabilities to employees and Governmental
Authorities required by the WARN Act or by any other applicable law relating
to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that are required
to be provided before the Effective Time as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and Acquiror shall be responsible for any and
all such matters following the Effective Time. The Company shall cooperate in
preparing and distributing any notices that Acquiror may desire to provide
prior to the Effective Time, in connection with actions by Acquiror after the
Effective Time would result in a notice requirement under such laws.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all steps necessary (1) to amend the First Capital Bancorp, Inc. Directors
Deferral Plan (the " _Deferral Plan_ ") to provide that any additional
amounts deferred under the Deferral Plan from the date hereof through the
Closing Date shall not be notionally invested in shares of Company Stock and
that any dividends paid on shares of Company Stock in the Rabbi Trust (within
the meaning of the Deferral Plan) shall not be reinvested under the Plan or
the Rabbi Trust and (2) to terminate the Deferral Plan effective as of the
Closing Date.

6.13 _Certain Adjustments._ Upon the request of the Acquiror, the Company
shall (a) consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and
regulatory accounting principles, use its best efforts to record any
accounting adjustments required to conform the (1) loan, litigation and other
reserves (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) and (2) real
estate and securities valuation policies and practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries so as to reflect consistently on a mutually satisfactory basis
the policies and practices of the Acquiror and (b) make reasonable adjustments
to the corporate structure of



 

-40- the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries and transfer assets or
liabilities between the Company and its Subsidiaries or between Subsidiaries;
_provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be obligated to record any
such accounting adjustments (1) unless and until the Company shall be
satisfied that the conditions to the obligation of the parties to consummate
the Merger will be satisfied or waived on or before the Closing Date and (2)
in no event until the day prior to the Closing Date.

6.14 _Certain Contracts_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (a) shall
cause any Contracts with Related Persons (other than Compensation Plans)
specified by the Acquiror to be terminated (effective immediately prior to or
as of the Effective Time) without any penalty or other adverse consequences to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Contracts with third parties reasonably requested by the
Acquiror to be terminated (effective immediately prior to or as of the
Effective Time) without any penalty or other adverse consequences to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to be amended in the manner reasonably
requested by the Acquiror; _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be
obligated to cause any such Contract to be terminated unless and until the
Company shall be satisfied that the conditions to the obligation of the
parties to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or waived on or before the
Closing Date, and such terminations shall be conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger.

6.15 _Regulatory Compliance_. In consultation with the Acquiror, the Company
will take all reasonable measures to ensure that the Surviving Corporations
subsidiary depository institutions will perform at a level of at
least "satisfactory" under the CRA and that the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiary depository institutions should be deemed "well managed" by their
"appropriate Federal banking agency" (as such term is defined in Section 3(q)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act).

6.16 _Formation of Acquiror Sub_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Acquiror shall cause Acquiror Sub to be duly
organized as a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Acquiror and
to become a party to this Agreement by executing and delivering a supplement
hereto.

6.17 _Post-Closing Merger_. The Company acknowledges that following the
Effective Time, Acquiror intends to effect the merger of the Company and
the Bank with and into RBC Centura Bank (the " _Post-Closing Mergers_ ").
Prior to the Effective Time, upon the Acquirors request, and at the
Acquirors sole cost and expense, the Company shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, so as to permit consummation of the Post-Closing Mergers
and shall cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the Acquiror to
that end, including entering into such Contracts and filing such
applications, notices and other documents with Governmental Authorities as
necessary to effect the Post-Closing Mergers; _provided_ that the
effectiveness of any such Contracts shall be contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement.

-43- ARTICLE VIII

Termination

8.01 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned:

(a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent of the Acquiror and the Company, if the Board of Directors of each so
determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.

(b) _Breach_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Acquiror or the
Company (and with written notice to the other party), in each case if its
Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event of either: (1) a breach by the other party of any
representation or warranty contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching
party of such breach; or (2) a breach by the other party of any of the
covenants or agreements contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not
been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the breaching
party of such breach and which breach, individually or in the aggregate with
other such breaches, would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a)
or (b), in the case of a breach or breaches by the Company, or Section 7.02(a)
or (b), in the case of a breach or breaches by the Acquiror, not to be
satisfied or would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company or the Acquiror to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Delay_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Acquiror or the
Company (and with written notice to the other party), in each case if its
Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by March 31,
2007 (the " _Permitted Termination Date_ "), except to the extent that
the failure of the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results
from the action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.01(c).

(d) _No Approval_. By the Company or the Acquiror (and with written notice to
the other party), in each case if its Board of Directors so determines by a
vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in the event the
approval of any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been
denied by final nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority.

 

(e) _Failure to Recommend, Etc_. By the Acquiror (and with written notice to
the Company), if (1) at any time prior to the receipt of the approval of the
Companys shareholders contemplated by Section 7.01(a), the Company Board
shall have failed to recommend that the shareholders give such approval,
withdrawn such recommendation or modified, qualified or changed
such recommendation (or publicly announced its intention to withdraw, modify,
qualify or change) in a manner adverse to the interests of the Acquiror or (2)
the Company Board takes any of the actions described in clause (ii) or (iii)
of the proviso to Section 6.06.

breaching party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement giving
rise to such termination.

8.03 _Termination Fee._ (a) In addition to any other rights that the Acquiror
has under this Agreement and/or otherwise, the Company shall pay to the
Acquiror $18,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") (it being understood that
such fee is not intended as liquidated damages), if:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Acquiror pursuant to (A) Section
8.01(b) with respect to a breach of Section 6.02 or 6.06 on the part of the
Company or (B) Section 8.01(e); or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f);
or

(iii) a Fee Payment Event shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of a Fee

months after termination of this Agreement if such termination follows the

the Company Board shall have recommended that the shareholders of the Company

20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the term
" _beneficial ownership_ " for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder);

(iii) The shareholders of the Company shall have voted and failed to approve
this Agreement at a meeting which has been held for that purpose or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, or such meeting shall not have been held
or shall have been canceled prior to termination of this Agreement if,
prior to such meeting (or if such meeting shall not have been held or shall
have been canceled, prior to such termination), it shall have been publicly
announced that any person (other than the Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries)
shall have made, or disclosed an intention to make, a bona fide proposal to
engage in an Acquisition Transaction;

(iv) The Company Board shall have withdrawn, modified, qualified or changed
(or publicly announced its intention to withdraw, modify, qualify or changed)
in any manner adverse in any respect to the Acquiror its recommendation that

Agreement in anticipation of engaging in an Acquisition Transaction, or the
Company shall have authorized, recommended, proposed (or publicly announced
its intention to authorize, recommend or propose) an agreement to engage
in an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than the Acquiror or its
Subsidiary;

(v) Any person other than the Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary shall have
filed with the SEC a registration statement or tender offer materials with
respect to a potential exchange or tender offer that would constitute an
Acquisition Transaction (or filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC
with respect to a potential vote by its shareholders to approve the issuance
of shares to be offered in such an exchange offer);

(vi) The Company shall have willfully breached any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement after an overture is made by a third party to
Company or its shareholders to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, and
following such breach the Acquiror would be entitled to terminate this
Agreement (whether immediately or after the giving of notice or passage of
time or both); or

(vii) Any person other than the Acquiror or any Acquiror Subsidiary, without
Acquirors prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice
with any regulatory or antitrust authority regarding an Acquisition
Transaction. 



 

-46- (d) The term " _Fee Payment Event_ " shall mean any of the following events or
transactions occurring after the date hereof:

(i) The acquisition by any person (other than the Acquiror or any Acquiror
Subsidiary) of beneficial ownership of 40 percent or more of the then
outstanding Company Common Stock; or

(ii) The occurrence of the Tolling Event described in clause (i) of the
definition of the term "Tolling Event", except that the percentage referred to
in clause (z) of the definition of the term "Acquisition Transaction" shall be
25 percent.

(e) Any payment required to be made under Section 8.03(a)(i) shall be payable
within three business days following such termination; any payment required

shall be made prior to or contemporaneously with such termination; and any
payment required to be made under Section 8.03(a)(iii) shall be
payable within three business days following the Fee Payment Event. In any
case such payment shall be made, without setoff, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Acquiror.

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and are cumulative with, and not intended to limit, other remedies that may be
available, and that, without these agreements, the Acquiror would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Acquiror commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment set forth in this Section 8.03, the Company shall pay
the Acquirors costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on any amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.03 from the date such amount becomes payable until the date of such
payment at the prime rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date
such payment was required to be made plus two percent.

(g) The Company shall notify the Acquiror promptly in writing of the
occurrence of any Tolling Event or Fee Payment Event, it being understood that
the giving of such notice by the Company shall not be a condition to the
Acquirors rights pursuant to this Section 8.03.

(together with the Disclosure Schedule, the Exhibits and the Annexes hereto)
represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to
all the matters encompassed or contemplated herein or agreed to in
contemplation hereof and this Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or
written agreements heretofore made. Except for Section 6.10, insofar as such
Section expressly provides certain rights to the Indemnified Parties named

confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or

thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith in
an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to
effect the original intent of the parties.

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. All of the parties hereto irrevocably waive any
and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
