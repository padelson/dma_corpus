ARTICLE III

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition
Sub:

(a)  _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Common Stock held by
the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _3.1(a)_ hereof) shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in
cash, without interest, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to _Section 3.1(d)_. The holders of certificates or
book-entry shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Common Stock (respectively, the " _Certificates_ " and " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Stock
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with 
_Section_ _ _ _3.2_ of this Agreement.

 



3 (c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of
a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (other
than cash dividends paid on the Series A Serial Preferred Stock pursuant to
_Section 6.1(c)_ of this Agreement), the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change to provide Parent and the holders of
Common Stock the same economic benefit as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to any such event; _provided_ that the Company may not effect such change
except as permitted by this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a national bank or trust company as
paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of
appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the
payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ _ _ _3.1(b)_.
Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or before the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an
amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (all cash deposited with
the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _3.1(b)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount
which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.
The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit
of the holders of Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the
payments pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _3.2(c)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _3.2(c)_ , except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry

 



4  Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and/or
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the
number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which
instructions shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify).

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to the instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ ,
by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable
in respect thereof), and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _3.1(b)_ ; _provided_ that such holder of Book-Entry
Shares has delivered, or the Company shall possess, information sufficient to
effect payment to such holder of the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. Each registered holder of
one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically, subject to the proviso in
the immediately preceding sentence, upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Common Stock represented by such
holders Book-Entry Shares that were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. The Paying
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of all or any portion of the Merger
Consideration in respect of cancelled Common Stock is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have 

 



5  paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates or Book
Entry Shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax is not applicable.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
or its designee, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article_ _ _ _III_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent, or such designee, as general creditor thereof for payment
of their claims for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be
entitled.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal
Requirement. 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article_ _ _ _III_ , (ii) to the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, Parent shall, in accordance
with _Section 3.2(a)_ , promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock in
the amount of such losses, (iii) no such investment shall have maturities that

Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units._

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option, in
consideration for the right to receive at or as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time a cash payment, if any, with respect
thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share of Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, less any required withholding Taxes and without interest
(the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, all Company
Options (whether vested or unvested) shall no longer be

 



6  outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Option Cash Payment, if any. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to any Company Option
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, then the holder of such Company
Option shall receive no consideration in respect thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate
this _Section_ _ _ _3.3(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Share Units_. As of the Effective Time, each
Restricted Share Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive at or as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash equal
to the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes and without
interest (the " _Restricted Unit Payment_ "). As of the Effective Time, all
Restricted Share Units shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
cease to exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Unit Payment.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all amounts payable in
respect of a Restricted Share Unit shall be paid in accordance with the terms
of the applicable Company Plan and award agreement, except as may be (i)
necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional Taxes or penalties in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, or (ii) required under a
payment election made by an individual award holder in respect of the
applicable Restricted Share Unit. For purposes of the foregoing, each
outstanding award of Restricted Share Units that is subject to a performance-
based vesting requirement shall become fully vested and converted as provided
above based upon the number of units at the "target" level of performance
applicable to such award. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3(b)_.

 

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable cash
in the amount necessary to make the payments required under _Section_ _ _
_3.3(a)_ and _Section 3.3(b)_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
make the payments required under  _Section_ _ _ _3.3(a)_ and _Section 3.3(b)_

cash in the amount necessary to make the payments required pursuant to
the Series A Serial Preferred Stock Transactions.

Section 3.5 _Debt Offer_. At the Closing, the Company shall (a) accept
for payment (with funds to be advanced or contributed by Parent) all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the date of Closing pursuant
to the Debt Offer, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
the Debt Offer; and (b) if Parent has not delivered to

 



7  the Company a written request to commence the Debt Offer and Consent
Solicitation pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 6.18(a)_ (and has not
itself commenced the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation), or withdraws
such request after it is given, or the Debt Offer is not consummated because a
condition thereto has not been satisfied (provided that Parent has provided
the documentation contemplated by _Section 6.18(b)_ ), (A) mail or cause to
be mailed a notice of redemption (the " _Notice of Redemption_ ") to the
holders of the Notes in accordance with Sections 3.03 and 3.07(c) of the Notes
Indenture and Section 5(c) of the Notes, (B) irrevocably deposit (with funds

Indenture Trustee the officers certificate and opinion of counsel (which
opinion shall be provided by Parent) specified in Section 12.04 of the Notes
Indenture, and (E) request in writing that the Indenture Trustee acknowledge
in writing the discharge of the Notes and the Notes Indenture with respect to
the Notes (the " _Acknowledgment_ "); _provided_ , that any failure of the
Indenture Trustee to provide the Acknowledgment shall not constitute a breach
by the Company of this _Section 3.5_.

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an Affidavit of Loss of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent in their
respective reasonable discretion, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _III_.

 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed and
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
will cease to have any rights with respect to any Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Legal Requirements.
If Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer
following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the
Merger Consideration, as provided for in this _Article_ _ _ _III_ , for each
share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. All cash paid
upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article_ _ _ _III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject,
however, to Parent and the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time.

Section 3.8 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable to the holders of Common Stock,

 



8  Company Options and Restricted Share Units pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax
Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
deducted, withheld and paid over amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB

 

Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Ultimate
Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub (i) is a corporation or legal
entity duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing, under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation, (ii) has the
requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have
such power or authority or such governmental

 



27  approvals would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing that would not have, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 5.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct
copy of the certificate of incorporation, By-laws (or equivalent
organizational documents), and other organizational documents, agreements or
arrangements, each as amended to date, of each of Ultimate Parent,
Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub (collectively, " _Parent Organizational
Documents_ "). The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and
effect. None of Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent, Acquisition Sub or, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto are in violation of any
provision of the Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Ultimate Parent,
Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent
and Acquisition Sub and the consummation by Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent
and Acquisition Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
of Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent or
Acquisition Sub or their respective stockholders are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the
Merger, (x) the adoption of this Agreement by Operating Parent in its capacity
as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, which adoption shall occur
immediately following the execution of this Agreement, and (y) the filing of
the Articles of Merger with the Department of State). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent
and Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub,
enforceable against Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Legal Requirements of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights, and by general equitable principles).

Section 5.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent,
Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub does not, and the performance of this
Agreement

 



28  by Ultimate Parent, Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub will not, (i)
conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or By-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of (A) Ultimate Parent, (B) Operating
Parent or (C) Acquisition Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and
authorizations specified in _Section_ _ _ _5.4(b)_ have been received and the
waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition precedent
to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been satisfied,
conflict with or violate any Legal Requirements applicable to Parent or
Acquisition Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition
Sub is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other contract, agreement,
lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or Acquisition Sub is a party or by which Parent or Acquisition Sub or
any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub is bound or affected, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences of the type referred to
above which would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Ultimate Parent, Operating
Parent and Acquisition Sub do not, and the consummation by Ultimate Parent,
Operating Parent and Acquisition Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority,
except for applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act,
Blue Sky Laws, the HSR Act and other Antitrust Approvals, filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the FBCA and the
rules of the NASDAQ or other stock exchange, if applicable, and except where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, would not have, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no
claim, action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against either Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their
respective properties or assets at law or in equity, and there are no
Orders before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority, in each case as would
have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
(i) an executed debt financing commitment letter, dated as of the date of
this Agreement (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from
time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section_ _ _
_6.10_ , the " _Commitment Letter_ "), from the lenders (including any
lenders who become party thereto by joinder) party thereto

 



29  (collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt
amounts set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, together with any permitted Alternative Debt Financing, is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_ ") and
(ii) the fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter (redacted in a
customary manner, which redacted terms would not decrease the amount of or
increase the conditionality of the Debt Financing) (the " _Fee Letter_ "),
each as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to
time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section_ _ _ _6.10_.
Except as set forth in the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter delivered to
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or
any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of
the Debt Financing. There are no other agreements, side letters
or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing to which Parent or any of its
subsidiaries is a party as of the date of this Agreement (other than customary
engagement letters and fee discount letter). As of the date of this Agreement,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default, event of default or breach on the part of Parent
or Acquisition Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto,
under the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, in each case, that would
adversely affect or delay in any material respect the availability of the Debt
Financing at Closing. Assuming no breach by the Company of its representations
and/or obligations hereunder, in either case, such that the closing
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would fail to be
satisfied, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has any reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition to closing to be
satisfied by it in the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter on or prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter have not been modified, altered or amended on or prior to the date of
this Agreement. None of the commitments under the Commitment Letter have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter are in full force and effect as of the date
of this Agreement and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent (or
the Affiliate of such Parent party thereto), enforceable against such Parent
(or the Affiliate of such Parent party thereto) and, to the knowledge of
Parent, each other party thereto, in each case, in accordance with their
terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting generally the
enforcement of creditors rights and remedies and principles of equity.

 

(c) The proceeds of the Debt Financing, if funded, together with available
cash of Parent and its subsidiaries, will constitute sufficient funds for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this
Agreement on the Closing Date, including the payment of the Total Common
Merger Consideration and all other amounts to be paid on the Closing Date
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _3.2_ , _Section_ _ _ _3.3_ and _Section 3.4_ and
the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Merger (including
any 

 



30  repayment, redemption or refinancing of the Notes and any other Indebtedness
of the Company required in connection therewith). Without limitation to
_Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.4(b)_ , the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding the ability of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, or any other person, to obtain financing for the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Operating Parent.
Acquisition Sub does not have outstanding any option, warrant, right or other
agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may acquire any
equity interest of Acquisition Sub. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not
conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the
Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission payable by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent.

 

Section 5.9 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities; FBCA Section_ _ _
_607.0901_. None of Parent or any of its subsidiaries is the "beneficial
owner" (as defined in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA) of any shares of Common
Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic
interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company. Neither
Parent nor any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (each as defined in Section
607.0901 of the FBCA) is, or has been at any time with the last three (3)
years, an "interested shareholder" as defined in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA.
Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has taken, or authorized or
permitted any its Representatives to take, any action that would cause Parent
or any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (each as defined in Section
607.0901 of the FBCA) thereof to be deemed an "interested shareholder" as
defined in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA or otherwise render Section 607.0901
of the FBCA inapplicable to the Merger.

Section 5.10 _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent and
Acquisition Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it
is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and will
not, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, omit to state any material
fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders Meeting which
shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of
the foregoing documents or any statements or omissions based upon such
information.

 



31 Section 5.11 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations
and Warranties_. Parent and Acquisition Sub each acknowledge and agree that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article
IV this Agreement or in the certificate referenced in _Section 7.2(c)_ ,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Representatives, nor any other person on behalf of the Company, makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with
respect to any other information made available to Parent or Acquisition Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
and Acquisition Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty except
for those expressly set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges
that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation
of the condition, operations and business of the Company and its subsidiaries
and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
has relied on the results of its own independent investigation.

delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (and in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is
executed) make its respective filings required under the HSR Act, and
thereafter promptly make any other filings required to obtain any other
Antitrust Approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take (and to cause their subsidiaries
to take) promptly any and all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment and obtain all Antitrust Approvals that may be required
by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority so as to
enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable and in any event before the Outside Date. Such
actions shall include (i) each of Parent and the Company complying
substantially with any requests for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws; (ii) Parent

 



36  proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, committing to and effecting), by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective subsidiaries; (iii) Parent proposing,
negotiating, or offering to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,
committing to and effecting) actions that limit its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries;
and (iv) each of Parent and the Company taking any and all other actions
reasonably necessary in order to ensure that the waiting period under the HSR
Act has expired or been terminated and that any other required Antitrust
Approvals have been obtained and that no decree, judgment, injunction
(preliminary or permanent), temporary restraining order or any other order in
any suit or proceeding relating to any Antitrust Laws would preclude
consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date; for the avoidance of any
doubt, such actions shall include all necessary actions to appeal that decree,
judgment, injunction (preliminary or permanent), temporary restraining order
with an appellate court or other appellate Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction unless and until a final, non-appealable order has
been issued. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in
this _Section_ _ _ _6.2_ , and only if requested in writing by Parent,
the Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliates agree to take, or cause to be
taken, any action reasonably in furtherance of the foregoing, so long as such
action is conditioned upon the Closing. Furthermore, and for the avoidance of
doubt, none of Parents Affiliates (other than Parents subsidiaries) shall
be required to take or agree to take any action or actions in furtherance of
this _Section 6.2(b)_.

 

(c) The Company shall give (or shall cause its subsidiaries to give) any
notices to third parties, and Parent shall use, and cause each of its
subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company
in its efforts, to obtain any third-party consents not covered by paragraph
(a) above that are necessary or proper to consummate the Merger;  _provided_
that the Company shall not be required to make any payments to a third-party
to obtain any consent or approval of such third-party prior to the Closing,
and shall not agree to make any such payments without Parents prior written
consent. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in
responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately
informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making
any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying
each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings (other than the
HSR Notification and Report Form) or substantive communications between either
party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement;
_provided_ that such materials may be redacted to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company and as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege concerns. Each party will give the other party the
opportunity to attend any meetings, or to participate in any substantive
communications with, a Government Authority to the extent permitted by such
Government Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any third-party
consents pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not be considered a condition
to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger.

 



37 Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on
which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1_ , to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, upon reasonable notice, the
Company will provide to Parent and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, Debt Financing
Sources, agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_
"), subject to the other restrictions in this _Section 6.3_ , reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Companys employees, properties,
books, contracts and records, Tax Returns and other information as Parent may
reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees,
Taxes and other aspects of the Company (but not including access to perform
physical or environmental examinations or to take samples of the soil, ground
water, air or products without the prior written consent of the Company);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (i) in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, any contract or applicable
Legal Requirement requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to
such documents or information, or (iii) in the reasonable good faith judgment
of the Company, such access would violate any obligations of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality obligations to any
third party. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information to
Parent in a way that would not violate the foregoing restrictions, including
by (A) using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required
consent of any third party necessary (in the Companys good faith judgment)
to provide such disclosure or (B) providing such information in redacted form
as is necessary to preserve such a privilege or comply with such Legal
Requirement, or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements,
to the extent possible, that are reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section_ _ _ _6.3_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction of any property or
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

(b) The information provided pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _6.3_ shall be
used solely for the purpose of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their or their Affiliates respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to _Section_ _ _
_6.3(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the parties agree that (i) a Partial Company Transaction that is
entered into in accordance with _Section 6.5(e)_ shall not be deemed an
Alternative Transaction (as

 



38  defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) the standstill provisions in
Section 12 of Confidentiality Agreement applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their respective Affiliates shall not terminate upon the Companys entry
into an agreement providing for a Partial Company Transaction in accordance
with _Section 6.5(e)_ and (iii) in the event that the Company enters into a
Partial Company Transaction in accordance with  _Section 6.5(e)_ , the
standstill provisions set forth in Section 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in effect until the later to occur of (A) the expiration of the
period set forth in Section 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof and (B) the date that is six (6) months following the
consummation of such Partial Company Transaction; _provided_ that in no event
shall such provisions terminate any later than June 30, 2017. The
provisions in the foregoing sentence shall automatically cease to apply with
respect to any Partial Company Transaction (or any agreement with respect
thereto) that, following the Companys entry into such agreement in accordance
with _Section 6.5(e)_ , is amended or modified in a manner that has the
effect of materially reducing the purchase price payable with respect thereto.

 

Section 6.4 _Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof (and in any event,
but subject to Parents timely performance of its obligations under _Section
6.4(b)_ , within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof or such later
date as to which Parent consents in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), the Company shall prepare
and shall cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement
on Schedule 14A relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Except
as expressly contemplated by _Section 6.5(e)_ , the Proxy Statement shall
include the Company Recommendation, the Fairness Opinion and any materials
required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
FBCA. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing
of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the
time of the Stockholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to information supplied by Parent or Acquisition Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to
satisfy all rules of NASDAQ. The Company shall promptly notify Parents
counsel upon the receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC, or any request from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly
provide Parents counsel with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC
or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company
shall consult with Parent and its counsel prior to submitting to the SEC or
the staff of the SEC any response to any such 

 



39  comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement or the dissemination
thereof to the holders of Common Stock, or submitting to the SEC or the staff
of the SEC any response to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents and responses,
and the Company will consider, in good faith, incorporating any such comments
of Parent and/or its counsel prior to such filing, dissemination or
submission.

 

(b) Parent shall provide to the Company in writing all information
concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub as is customarily included in a Proxy
Statement prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by
this Agreement and as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the
Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments
of the SEC or its staff related thereto. Parent will cause the information
relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub supplied by it for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or
warranty is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to information
supplied by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Parent will furnish to
the Company in writing the information relating to it and Acquisition Sub
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement promptly
following written request therefor from the Company.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements
(including the FBCA), its constituent documents (including the Company
Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws) and the rules of NASDAQ (i)
establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of the stockholders
of the Company, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement
(the " _Stockholders  Meeting_"), and (ii) mail to the holders of Common
Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting a Proxy
Statement (the date the Company elects to take such action or is required to
take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ "). The Company shall duly call, convene
and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall such
meeting be held later than forty-five (45) days following the date the Proxy
Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the Company other than in the case
in which the Company is required to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC or
its staff or a court of competent jurisdiction has instructed the Company is
necessary under applicable Legal Requirements or Order and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
holders of Common Stock prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may, with
or without the consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone the Stockholders
Meeting only if (A) the Company has determined in good faith after 

 



40  consultation with its outside counsel that the failure of the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to
be a violation of applicable Legal Requirement, (B) as of the time for which
the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Stockholders Meeting or insufficient proxies returned to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, and Parent requests such an
adjournment or postponement, or (C) after consultation with Parent, to
the extent reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and/or mailing of any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
that the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with its
outside counsel is required under applicable Legal Requirement and for such
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to and
reviewed by the stockholders of the Company in advance of the Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company may only adjourn or postpone the Stockholders meeting
under this _Section 6.4(c)_ for an aggregate period of no more than thirty
(30) days after the day on which the Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement); _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company shall not be permitted in any circumstance to adjourn or postpone
the Stockholders Meeting to a date that is on or after the date that is five
(5) Business Days prior to the Outside Date. Once the Company has established
a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Legal Requirements or the Companys constituent documents
(including the Company Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws). The Company
shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements
(including all applicable rules of NASDAQ and the FBCA) and, unless the
Company Board shall have made a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.5(e)_ , the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies from the holders of Common Stock for the adoption and
approval of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation,
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall submit this Agreement to the holders of Common Stock as
promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, upon the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent in writing at least on a daily
basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their respective
officers or directors is known by the Company which, pursuant to the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent.
Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading.

 



41 Section 6.5 _Solicitation; Change of Recommendation_. 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
its and their Representatives to, and shall direct its and their Affiliates
to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any persons that
may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal and, until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _8.1_ , not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing Proposal; (ii)
participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, any Competing Proposal; (iii) engage in
discussions with any person with respect to any Competing Proposal; (iv)
approve or recommend any Competing Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any
Competing Proposal; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar Takeover Statute, or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the Company Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of
the Company, inapplicable to any person other than Parent and its Affiliates
or to any transactions constituting or contemplated by a Competing Proposal;
or (vii) adopt resolutions to do any of the foregoing or agree to do any of
the foregoing. The Company shall take such action as is necessary to enforce,
and not, without Parents prior written consent, terminate, amend, modify or
waive any standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality or other
agreement with such person; _provided_ that the Company hereby waives all
standstill provisions in Section 12 of the Confidentiality Agreement
applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that taking such action to
enforce or the failure to take such other action described above in this
sentence would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements, the Company may, upon delivery of advance
written notice to Parent, waive any such standstill or similar provisions
solely to the extent necessary to permit a third-party to make, on a
confidential basis to the Company Board, a Competing Proposal, conditioned
upon such third-party agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from
providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Competing
Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this  _Section
6.5_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in  _Section_ _ _ _6.5(a)_ ,
if, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Companys receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives receives an unsolicited written
Competing Proposal that did not result from any breach of this _Section_ _ _
_6.5_ and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors that such Competing
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result, after the
taking of any of the actions referred to in either clause (x) or (y) below, in
a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish
information to the third-party making such Competing Proposal ( _provided_
that the Company makes such information available to Parent substantially
simultaneously to the extent such information was not previously
made available to Parent) and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
the third-party with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case

 



42  of (x) and (y), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company receives from the third-party an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement as of the date it was executed (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that promptly (but in
no event more than thirty-six (36) hours) following the Company taking such
actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, the Company shall provide
notice to Parent (orally and in writing) of such determination of the Company
Board as provided for in clauses (i) or (ii) above. From and after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall notify Parent (orally and in
writing) promptly (but in any event within thirty-six (36) hours) of the
receipt by it, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives of any Competing Proposal and (A) if it is in writing, deliver
to Parent a copy of such Competing Proposal and any related draft agreements
and other written material setting forth the terms and conditions of
such Competing Proposal or (B) if it is oral, provide to Parent a reasonably
detailed summary of the material terms and conditions thereof including of the
identity of the person (and the identity of such persons beneficial owners)
making such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material details
(including any change to the price) of any such Competing Proposal and with
respect to any material change to the terms of any such Competing Proposal
within thirty-six (36) hours of such material change.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ _ _ _6.5(d)_ or _Section
6.5(e)_ , neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may (i)
withdraw or withhold, rescind, amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse
to Parent the Company Recommendation or make any public announcement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or publicly propose to do any
of the foregoing, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment thereof, (iii) approve, adopt, endorse, declare the
advisability of or recommend any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal,
(iv) take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, subject to _Section 6.5(d)_ ), (v) following the date any
Competing Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public,
sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press
release that expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days following Parents written request to do so (any action
described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) whether taken by the
Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof, being referred to as a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "), (vi) cause, authorize or permit the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement-in-principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to or
providing for any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, or otherwise breach, this
Agreement or (vii) publicly propose or announce an intention to take any of
the foregoing actions.

 



43 (d) Nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_  shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or its subsidiaries from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making
any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) thereunder) or to prohibit the Company from
making any disclosure if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Legal
Requirements, nor shall any such action be deemed to constitute a breach of
the Companys obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section_ _ _ _6.5(d)_ shall permit the Company to effect
a Change of Recommendation (including in compliance with Rule 14e-2, Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
other applicable Legal Requirements) without complying with _Section_ _ _
_6.5(e)_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such disclosure that does not
reaffirm the Company Recommendation (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall constitute a Change of Recommendation.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Companys
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may: (i) make a
Change of Recommendation in response to (A) the Company receiving an
unsolicited, written Competing Proposal that did not result from any breach
of this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ that the Company Board has concluded in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors
constitutes a Superior Proposal, or (B) an Intervening Event, in each case,
if the Company Board has concluded in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel and financial advisors that the failure of the
Company Board to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements); or
(ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _8.1(i)_ , pay, simultaneously with and as a condition
precedent to such termination (provided Parent provides wiring instructions
for such payment), the Company Termination Fee and enter into a binding
written agreement (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") with respect to
an unsolicited, written Competing Proposal received not resulting from any
breach of this _Section 6.5_ that the Company Board has concluded in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial
advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to taking the action set forth in clause (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, (x)
the Company (A) shall have complied with this _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ in all
material respects and (B) first provided prior written notice to Parent in
advance of its intention to take such action (a " _Company Board Notice_ ")
which notice shall specify (1) in the case of such an action taken
in connection with a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal (including the final draft of the Superior Proposal
Agreement, if applicable) and the identity of the person (and the identity of
such persons beneficial owners) making such Competing Proposal or (2) in the
case of such an action taken in connection with an Intervening Event, all
available information with respect to such Intervening Event, and (y) for a
period of five (5) Business Days following Parents receipt of the Company
Board Notice, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company one or more
proposals for amendments to this Agreement and the Company shall

 



44  negotiate with Parent in good faith with respect thereto, and, after such
five (5) Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors,
taking into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement proposed by
Parent, that the Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, or, in the
case of a Company Board Notice that is related to an Intervening Event, that
the failure to make such Change of Recommendation continues to be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements.
Any subsequent modification to the material terms and conditions of such
Competing Proposal (including any revision to price), or any change to the
material facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, as
applicable, shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Company
Board Notice and again comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_
with respect to such revised Competing Proposal or Intervening Event, except
that the period referred to in clause (y) above shall be deemed to be the
longer of (I) three (3) Business Days and (II) the period remaining under the
notice period under clause (y) above immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice pursuant to this sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company may simultaneously give notice of its intention both to make a Change
of Recommendation and to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Superior
Proposal Agreement and the notice and negotiation periods set forth in this
_Section_ _ _ _6.5(e)_ for such actions may pass simultaneously.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, bona fide proposal for (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries), or expression by any person or "group" (as defined
for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) for: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities,
direct or indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer,
exchange offer or other similar transaction in which (x) a person or "group"
(as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of
persons directly or indirectly acquires, or if consummated in accordance with
its terms would acquire, beneficial or record ownership of
securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class
of voting securities of the Company or more than 20% of the aggregate voting
power of the Company; or (y) the Company issues securities representing more
than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of voting
securities of the Company or more than 20% of the aggregate voting power of
the Company; or (ii) any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer,
acquisition or disposition of any assets or business of the Company and of
the subsidiaries of the Company (whether in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions) (A) that constitutes or accounts for more than 20% of
the consolidated net revenues of the Company, or (B) for a price that is more
than 20% of the enterprise value of the Company giving effect to the amount of
the Merger Consideration; or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the
Company.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona
fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the
definition of Competing Proposal increased to 70%) on terms that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel and financial advisors, would be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company than the transactions

 



45  contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all factors the Company
Board acting in good faith considers to be appropriate, including (i) any
proposal by Parent in writing to amend or modify the terms hereof, (ii) the
identity of the person (and the identity of such persons beneficial owners)
making such Competing Proposal, and (iii) the consideration, terms,
conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of such Competing Proposal.

(h) In the event that (i) this Agreement is amended to provide for a
Partial Company Transaction with Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including
in connection with an exercise of Parents right to propose amendments to this
Agreement in accordance with  _Section 6.5(e)_ (a " _Partial Company Parent
Transaction_ "), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated and Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on
the other hand, enter into an agreement that provides for a Partial Company
Parent Transaction, in either case at any time following delivery of a Company
Board Notice in connection with a Competing Proposal related to a Partial
Company Transaction, then, notwithstanding Section 12 of the Confidentiality
Agreement, so long as this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(i)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ), Parent and any of its subsidiaries shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to, and the Company shall take such
actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to allow Parent and any of
its subsidiaries to (including by terminating or waiving any standstill or
similar provision in any confidentiality or other agreement), (x) commence,
conduct and consummate a tender offer to acquire Common Stock or (y) otherwise
offer to, agree to and consummate a transaction to acquire the Company, in
each case on terms determined by Parent provided that (A) the per share price
shall be no less than (I) the Merger Consideration minus (II) the amount of
any dividends or other distributions declared or paid with respect to the
Common Stock from and after the date hereof, if any, (B) the consummation of
such tender offer or other transaction shall be conditioned on the
consummation of the Partial Company Parent Transaction, and (C) Parent and the
Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such
tender offer or other transaction does not materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Partial Company Parent Transaction. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Section 6.5(h)_ , Parent acknowledges that the
Company Board may make any recommendation (or take any similar position)
with respect to any such proposed tender offer or other transaction as the
Company Board determines in its sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 6.5(h)_ does not modify or limit in any way the rights of Parent
and obligations of the Company set forth in _Section 6.5(e)_ , with respect
to a proposed Partial Company Transaction or otherwise, including with respect
to Parents right to propose amendments to this Agreement in connection with a
Competing Proposal and the notice requirements and related time periods set
forth therein.

Section 6.6 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification and advancement for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of any
Indemnitee as provided in the articles or

 



46  certificates of incorporation or By-laws (or comparable organization
documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates or in any
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect with respect to such Indemnitee. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect
to all acts or omissions by them, in their capacities as such at any time
prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Legal
Requirements and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provisions of
the Company Articles of Incorporation or By-laws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and any indemnification agreement of the Company or its
subsidiaries or other applicable contract that has been made available to
Parent as in effect on the date of this Agreement in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _6.6(a)_ , during the
period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee
against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Merger, this Agreement
and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section_ _ _ _6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this 
_Section_ _ _ _6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with 

 



47  terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies;
_provided_ that the premium for such "tail" insurance shall not exceed 300%
of the annual premium currently paid by the Company (in which case Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain as much comparable insurance
as available for 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company).
If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no
less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300%
of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance;
_provided_ _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_. The provisions of this
_Section_ _ _ _6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and
his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay
all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ shall be
in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Legal Requirements or insurance
policy or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in  _Section_ _ _ _9.1_ or
_Section_ _ _ _9.6_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees
and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such

 



48  consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_.

 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent, and Parent
shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify the
Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) the discovery by
such party of any fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which could reasonably be expected, individually or taken
together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known to such
party, to cause or result in any of the conditions of the obligations of such
party to consummate the Merger not to be satisfied or the satisfaction of
which to be materially delayed. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _6.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations
or warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties hereunder.

 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Legal Requirements, court
process or any listing agreement with or rules of the NYSE, NASDAQ or other
stock exchange on which securities of Ultimate Parent or the Company is
listed; _provided_ that Parent and the Company may make any public statement
in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so
long as such statement is substantially similar to previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company
(or individually, if approved by the other party); and _provided_ , _further_
, that Parent and Acquisition Sub may make public statements regarding any
Competing Proposal that has been made public or in response to public
statements of any person (other than research analysts and proxy advisory
firms) recommending or encouraging stockholders of the Company not to adopt
and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, after consulting with the Company and considering in good faith any
comments provided by the Company with respect to such public statements to
the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, court process or any listing
agreement with or rules of the NYSE, NASDAQ or other stock exchange on which
securities of Ultimate Parent or the Company is listed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to _Section 6.5_ , the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any public statement made or proposed to be
made by the Company or Parent in connection with or following a Change
of Recommendation.

 



49 Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date until the second
anniversary thereof (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Company Employee (as defined below)), Parent shall provide or shall
cause one of its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, to provide to each employee of the Company and any of its
subsidiaries who continues his or her employment with Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and any of its subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Company Employees_ "), following the Closing Date, with:
(i) base salary that is not less than the base salary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that are not less favorable than that in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that cash compensation may
be substituted for equity compensation for purposes of long-term incentive
compensation), and (iii) employee benefits (excluding, for this purpose, any
defined benefit or supplemental pension plan (whether or not tax-qualified),
and post-termination health, life or other welfare benefits, in each case,
except as required by a Company Benefit Plan or by applicable Legal
Requirements) that are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than the
employee benefits provided to such Company Employee as of the Effective Time;
_provided_ that a change in employee benefits shall not be deemed to violate
this clause (iii) if such change results from a change in the applicable
program for all similarly-situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries
in the applicable jurisdiction so long as (A) Parent and its subsidiaries
continue to offer benefits to employees (including Company Employees) that
include medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance, and a
matching program comparable to the Companys 401(k) Plan or, as applicable, a
Company subsidiarys existing defined contribution plan, and (B) the aggregate
employee benefits provided to the employee are not less favorable than the
aggregate employee benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent
and its subsidiaries in the applicable jurisdiction. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall (x) honor or
cause to be honored the Elizabeth Arden, Inc. Severance Policy in accordance
with its terms (in effect on the date hereof, and as it may be amended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company Disclosure
Letter) and (y) with respect to any Company Employee who does not participate
in the Elizabeth Arden, Inc. Severance Policy and whose employment with the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates terminates prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, honor or cause to be honored any severance
policy or program applicable to such Company Employee as of the date of this
Agreement (as set forth in the plans or descriptions of plans in Section
4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including the Elizabeth Arden, Inc.
Non-Executive Severance Policy, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and as it may be amended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter), including by taking into
account service and compensation following the Effective Time. Parent shall
honor or cause the Surviving Corporation to honor any fiscal year 2017 bonus
program and any long-term incentive awards, in each case implemented or
granted by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



50 (b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Company Benefit
Plans and the Employee Benefit Plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Corporations subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and for purposes of
accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New
Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, before the
Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan;
_provided_ that the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for
purposes of each such New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence
of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
of such New Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in
such New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Following the date of this Agreement, no new offering periods shall be
commenced for purposes of the Companys 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall each provide, and shall cause each of
their respective subsidiaries to provide, and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause each of their respective representatives,
including legal, human resources and regulatory, to provide, all cooperation
reasonably requested by any other party hereto in connection with satisfying
legal obligations, including all notifications and consultations and other
processes necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, which
shall include any required notifications and consultations and
other processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union
or similar body. Prior to the Effective Time, except as necessary to comply
with any applicable Legal Requirement, neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Parent, enter or offer
to enter into any agreement with any works council, economic committee, union
or similar body which would have the effect of making any changes in the terms
and conditions of employment or pension benefits of any of the Company
Employees.

 



51 (e) Parent and the Company (and their respective subsidiaries) shall
reasonably cooperate and use good faith efforts in all matters reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 6.9_.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _9.8_ , the provisions
of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.9_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee or any other employee or service
provider of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or Affiliates (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ _ _ _6.9_ shall create such
rights in any such persons. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates
to terminate the employment or service of any Continuing Employee or other
employee or service provider at any time and for any reason or without reason;
(ii) require Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plans,
or other compensation or benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements or
arrangements, or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof;
(iii) amend any Company Benefit Plans or other compensation or benefit plans,
programs, policies, agreements or arrangements; or (iv) except as specifically
provided in this _Section 6.9_ , require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates to provide any Company
Employee with any particular level of compensation or benefits.

Section 6.10 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing at Closing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement
(subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.10(a)_ ), in accordance
with their terms, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) (or if available, on other terms that are
acceptable to Parent and would not (x) adversely affect the ability of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (y)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay fees and expenses and (z) add any new (or adversely
modify any existing) condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing as
compared to those in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect of the
date of this Agreement in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) satisfy (or, if
deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions in the Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and the Definitive Agreements
and otherwise comply with all of its obligations thereunder. In the event
that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or
waived and Parent is required

 



52  to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2_ , Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Lender to fund its respective
committed portion of the Debt Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ that nothing contained in
this _Section 6.10_ shall require either Parent or Acquisition Sub to bring
any enforcement action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source to
enforce its respective rights under the commitment to procure Debt Financing
pursuant to the applicable Commitment Letter and Fee Letter. Neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub shall, without the prior written consent of the Company,
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
(including any remedy) under, or replace (it being understood that
any Alternative Debt Financing shall not be deemed a replacement for purposes
of this sentence), the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment,
modification, or waiver or replacement (w) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing as compared to
those in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (x) adversely affects the ability of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to enforce their rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letter, Fee Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof or in the
Definitive Agreements, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
below the amount required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses, or (z)
would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt no consent from the
Company shall be required for: (A) any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification of the Commitment Letter that is limited to adding lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (including in
replacement of a Lender), (B) implementation or exercise of any "flex"
provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as of the date hereof, or
(C) any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to the Commitment
Letter or Definitive Agreements so long as such action would not be prohibited
by the foregoing clauses (w)-(z).

 

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor (other than a breach by the
Company of this Agreement which prevents or renders impracticable the
consummation of the Debt Financing) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub will
(1) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative debt
financing from the same or other source (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_ ")
(in an amount sufficient, when taken together with available cash on hand, and
any then-available Debt Financing pursuant to any then-existing Commitment
Letter, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) on
terms not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those contained in
the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter that the alternative financing would
replace (taking into account any flex provisions) and (2) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall require Parent
to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Fee Letter.

 



53 (c) For purposes of the foregoing  _Sections_ _ _ _6.10(a)_ and _(b)_ ,
(i) the term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any commitment
letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt financing
arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letters remaining in
effect at the time in question), (ii) the term " _Fee Letter_ " shall be
deemed to include any fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any
alternative debt financing arranged in compliance with this _Section_ _ _
_6.10_ , and (iii) the term " _Lenders_ " shall be deemed to include any
lenders providing the alternative debt financing arranged in compliance
herewith. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company with prompt
notice of any breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements of which Parent or Acquisition Sub gains knowledge and
termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements or any provision thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event will Parent or Acquisition Sub be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if
Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts
to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

 

Section 6.11 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) At all times from and after the date hereof to and through the Closing
Date, at the sole expense of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
respective officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and
accounting advisors, of the Company and its subsidiaries to, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent such

(iv) assisting in the preparation of and executing and delivering

ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing; and

(x) subject to the occurrence of the Closing, taking all corporate actions
necessary to permit consummation of the Debt Financing;

_provided_ , in each case under this _clause (a)_ , that nothing herein shall
require (1) such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, or (2) the
taking of any action that would conflict with or violate (x) the Company
Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, in each case that are not contingent
upon the Effective Time or (y) any applicable Legal Requirement. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its subsidiaries logos as may
be reasonably necessary in connection with the Debt Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ _ _ _6.11_ to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to

(other than any information provided in writing by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries specifically for use therein), in each case other than to the
extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors or employees.

 



56 (c) The Company shall deliver to Acquisition Sub on or prior to the
Closing Date, payoff letters with respect to (i) the Third Amended and

the Debt Financing to the extent that such information would, when taken as a
whole in the absence of such an update, contain untrue statements of material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading. In addition, if, in connection
with a marketing effort contemplated by the Commitment Letter, Parent
reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant
to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect
to the Company, which Parent reasonably desires to include in a customary
offering memorandum for the Debt Financing, then the Company shall discuss in
good faith whether the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K or
similar document containing such material non-public information.

 

Section 6.12 _Acquisition Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to
(a) cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Closing, Acquisition Sub shall not

contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any Indebtedness.

Section 6.13 _No Control of the Company_ __ _s Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
subsidiaries operations.

 



57 Section 6.14 _Rule_ _ _ _16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to ensure that the
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
control the defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company (i) shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
proceedings and correspondence relating to such litigation, (ii) shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate with the Company regarding the defense
or settlement of any such litigation, (iii) shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such litigation and (iv) shall not compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any settlement solely
for monetary damages paid entirely from proceeds of insurance, except for any
applicable deductible), or consent to the same without the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 6.16 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Legal
Requirements and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to cause the delisting of
the Company and of the Common Stock from the NASDAQ as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 

Section 6.17 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal
Requirements becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then Parent, the Company and their
respective boards of directors or managers, as applicable, shall take all
reasonable action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and otherwise
to minimize, the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.18 _Treatment of Certain Indebtedness_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt by the Company of
any written request by Parent to do so, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following receipt of such written request (provided that Parent
has provided the documentation contemplated by _Section 6.18(b)_ ), the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take the following
actions on such terms and conditions that are consistent with the requirements
of the Notes Indenture and the Notes and otherwise reasonably specified, from
time to time, by Parent: (i) make an offer to purchase with respect to all of
the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes

 



58  (the " _Debt Offer_ ") and (ii) commence a related consent solicitation (the
" _Consent Solicitation_ ") to amend the Notes Indenture to remove the
negative covenants and default provisions therefrom that are required to be
removed to effect the Merger. On the Closing Date, the Company shall accept
for purchase (with funds to be advanced or contributed by Parent) each Note
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offer, subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Debt Offer. Upon Parents
written request, the Company shall withdraw and terminate, amend or extend, or
cause to be withdrawn and terminated, amended or extended, any Debt Offer and
Consent Solicitation. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed
that the price to be paid in connection with the Debt Offer, conditionality,
ability to terminate, amend or extend the Debt Offer, and the form and
substance of the amendments to the Notes and the Notes Indenture to take
effect on the Closing Date, and the decision by Parent to terminate or extend
the Debt Offer, shall be within Parents sole discretion. None of the Notes
shall be required to be repurchased prior to the Closing Date. To the extent
Parent does not deliver to the Company a written request pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 6.18(a)_ (and has not itself commenced the Debt
Offer and the Consent Solicitation), or withdraws such request after it is
given, or the Debt Offer will not be consummated because a condition thereto
will not be satisfied or waived on or prior to the Closing, then at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent
shall determine the amount (the " _Indenture Discharge Amount_ ") that will be
required to be irrevocably deposited in trust with the Indenture Trustee to
effect the discharge of the Notes Indenture and the Notes pursuant to Section
11.01 of the Notes Indenture, assuming the mailing of the Notice of Redemption
on the Closing Date (the " _Optional Redemption_ ", and together with the
transactions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the " _Notes
Refinancing_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the closing of any Notes
Refinancing shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and funded
(including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
related thereto) by amounts provided, advanced or contribution by Parent or
Acquisition Sub, and (y) the Company and its subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any action in violation of Legal Requirements or the Notes
Indenture or the Notes in connection with the Notes Refinancing. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives and advisors to, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Notes Refinancing,
including entering into, upon the closing of the Consent Solicitation (or on
such earlier date as may be provided in the Debt Offer and Consent
Solicitation materials) and receipt of the requisite consents of noteholders,
one or more supplemental indentures (to be effective upon the execution
thereof, with the operative provisions thereof to take effect from and after
the date of the initial acceptance by the Company of Notes for purchase in the
Debt Offer) reflecting the amendments to the Notes Indenture approved in such
Consent Solicitation, and using its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Indenture Trustee, as trustee under the Notes Indenture, to promptly enter
into such supplemental indenture or supplemental indentures. Such cooperation
shall be subject to the same limitations, restrictions and conditions set
forth in _Section 6.11_ with respect to the Debt Financing cooperation.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation
(including, if applicable, all mailings to the holders of the Notes) in
connection with the Notes Refinancing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and

 



59  Parent. Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Debt Offer Documents and such other related
documentation, which shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by,
the Company. If at any time prior to the completion of the Notes Refinancing
any information should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to Debt Offer Documents and such
other related documentation, so that such documentation shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent (subject
to the review of, and comment by, the Company) describing such information
shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the
Notes.

 

(c) In connection with the Debt Offer, Parent may select one or more dealer
managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to provide assistance in connection therewith. The
Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with such parties so selected, including
entering into customary agreements with such parties in order to effectuate
the Debt Offer and the Consent Solicitation; _provided_ , that such
cooperation shall be subject to the same limitations, restrictions
and conditions set forth in _Section 6.11_ with respect to the Debt Financing
cooperation.

 

(d) Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Offer (which agents shall be selected by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company) upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-
pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company for all
of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the Debt Offer (including any
action taken to enforce Parents reimbursement obligation
hereunder), including fees of outside counsel, accountants and advisors.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and its
and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents,
advisors and representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Debt Offer and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than any information provided in writing by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries specifically for use therein), in each case other than to the
extent any of the foregoing arises from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a

 



68  whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "made
available to Parent" and words of similar import refer to information posted
to the electronic data room for Project Rouge and maintained by the Company
for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
delivered to Parent or a Representative of Parent (including by e-mail or by
specific identification of filing or exhibit to a filing available on the
SECs Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system) no later than
5:30 p.m. New York Time on June 13, 2016. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any statute defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
statute, as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America. For the purposes of applying a reference to a monetary sum expressed
in "dollars" or "$" to an amount paid in a currency other than currency of the
United States of America, such monetary sum shall be converted at an exchange
rate equal to the mid-point closing rate for converting "dollars" or "$" into
such other currency on the applicable date as quoted by Bloomberg. References
to "wholly owned subsidiaries" of the Company shall include any subsidiary of
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the equity interests.

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual
agreement of the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of, or
authorized by, their respective board of directors at any time prior to
the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, _Section 8.3(b)_ , _Section 8.4(b)_ ,
_Section 8.4(c)_ , _Section 9.8_ , _Section 9.9_ , _Section 9.10(b)_ ,
_Section_ _ _ _9.11(c)_ and _Section_ _ _ _9.13_ and this _Section 9.4_ (and
any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement,
waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the substance of
such Sections) may not be amended, supplement, waived or otherwise modified in
any manner that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any respect to the Debt
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources.

Section 9.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Legal Requirement, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by any other party with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



69 Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Legal
Requirement, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto
(whether by operation of a Legal Requirement or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, except that the Agreement may be
assigned by Parent or Acquisition Sub to an Affiliate of such party or any
source of financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that the party making such assignment shall not be released from
its obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the shares of
Acquisition Sub may be transferred to any person of which Parent is directly
or indirectly a wholly owned subsidiary or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of such person; _provided_ that such transfer shall not release
Parent or Acquisition Sub from their obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the annexes, exhibits and schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and except for (a) the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ hereof and
(b) as to any Debt Financing Source, the provisions of _Section 8.3(b)_ ,
_Section 8.4(b)_ ,  _Section 8.4(c)_ , _Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.9_ ,
_Section 9.10(b)_ , _Section_ _ _ _9.11(c)_ , _Section_ _ _ _9.13_ and this
_Section 9.8_ (which shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Debt
Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections), is not intended to and shall not
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
_Section_ _ _ _9.5_ without notice or liability to any other person. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons
other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the laws of the State of Florida shall govern any matters pertaining to the
internal

 



70  corporate governance of the Company, including, the interpretation of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger.

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to _Section 9.10(b)_ , the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Subject to _Section 9.10(b)_ , each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings a legal
proceeding to enforce the terms and provisions hereof, the Outside Date may,
to the extent determined to be appropriate by the court of competent
jurisdiction presiding over such legal proceeding, be extended by any time
period established by such court.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
Company or any other person be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger unless:

 

(i) with respect to the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration,
the Marketing Period has expired and all the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied (and remain satisfied) or
waived;

(ii) Parent (either directly or through its subsidiaries) has received the
full amount of the Debt Financing and/or Parent (either directly or through
its subsidiaries) has entered into Definitive Agreements in accordance with
_Section 6.10(a)_ and the full amount of the Debt Financing will be available
to Parent (either directly or through its subsidiaries) at the Closing (in
each case, other than as a result of willful breach by Parent or Acquisition
Sub of _Section 6.10_ hereof), subject only to consummation of the Closing;
and

(iii) the Company has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the
Closing will occur (and the Company has not revoked such confirmation).

 



71 For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee.

 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any
other court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State
of Delaware), for the purpose of any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect to such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party and nothing in this  _Section_ _ _ _9.11_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law,
(b) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware and any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat in any manner such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final
judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company Related
Parties and each of the other parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in New York County, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action brought against any Debt Financing Source in connection
with the Debt Financing, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to
the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court, (ii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding against any Debt Financing Source arising out of or relating to the
Debt Financing, this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any New York State court or in any such Federal court, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient

judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to you or us at the addresses set forth above shall be effective
service of process for any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court.

 



72 Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment) in two
(2) or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND
EACH COMPANY RELATED PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS
OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF OR IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE
DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING ANY LENDER OR OTHER PROVIDER THEREOF, INCLUDING
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE.
EACH PARTY (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
