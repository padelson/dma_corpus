PURCHASE AGREEMENT   THIS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the
"Agreement"), dated as of the 26th day of July, 2006, is by and among MATRIA
HEALTHCARE, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), FACET TECHNOLOGIES, LLC,
a Georgia limited liability company (the "Company"), and FACET ACQUISITION
LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("Purchaser").   WITNESSETH:  
WHEREAS, the Company is an engineering and manufacturing organization
that designs, develops, assembles and distributes products (including
microsampling devices for blood glucose monitoring) for the medical device
and drug delivery industry (the "Business");   WHEREAS, Seller is the owner
of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of
the Company (the "Interests"); and   WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell, and
Purchaser desires to purchase all of the Interests, all upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and
conditions contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE
I  Purchase and Sale of the Interests   SECTION 1.1 Purchase and Sale of
the Interests.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, all of the Interests, free and
clear of all Liens, and Purchaser shall pay to Seller as consideration
therefor the cash sum of (i) $122,000,000; minus (ii) the amount of the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' Indebtedness as of the Closing as shown on
the Closing Statement (as defined in Section 1.2(a) below and as prepared in
accordance with the provisions thereof) (the "Closing Indebtedness"); plus
(iii) the amount (if any) by which the Company\'s Working Capital as of 11:59
p.m. local time on the day prior to the Closing Date as shown on the Closing
Statement (the "Closing Working Capital Amount") is more than the Target
Working Capital Amount; minus (iv) the amount (if any) by which the
Company\'s Closing Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Working
Capital Amount; minus (v) the amount, if any, of the Cap Ex Shortfall (such
aggregate result, the "Purchase Price").   (b) At the Closing, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller in the manner described in Section 2.2 below an amount
equal to the Purchase Price as estimated in good faith by Purchaser and
Seller (the "Estimated Purchase Price") not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.     SECTION 1.2 Purchase Price Adjustment. The
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:   (a) Within forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare, in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the Statement of Adjustment Methods and
the Company\'s 2005 year end consolidated financial statements, and deliver
to Seller a written statement (in its final and binding form, the "Closing
Statement") setting forth the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working
Capital Amount, including the basis for such determinations and all
supporting calculations. The parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes
of determining adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
1.2, the Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
definitions, procedures, methodologies, judgments, assumptions and estimates
set forth on Exhibit A (the "Statement of Adjustment Methods").   (b) Upon
receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller shall have forty-five (45) days (the
"Review Period") to review such Closing Statement and related computations of
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Working Capital Amount. In connection with
the review of the Closing Statement, Purchaser shall give, and shall cause
its Representatives to give, to Seller and its Representatives reasonable
access to the books, records and other related materials of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the personnel of, and work papers (subject to execution
and delivery by Seller of a customary hold harmless letter in favor of the
Person(s) preparing such work papers) prepared by or for, Purchaser,
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives,
including, without limitation, to such historical financial information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as Seller or its Representatives
may reasonably request, in each case, in order to permit the timely and
complete review of the Closing Statement in accordance with this Section
1.2(b). If Seller has accepted such Closing Statement in writing or has not
given written notice to Purchaser setting forth any objection of Seller to
such Closing Statement (a "Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, then such Closing Statement shall be final and binding
upon the parties. In the event that Seller delivers a Statement of Objections
during the Review Period, which Statement of Objections shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement being
asserted, Purchaser and Seller shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve
in writing any differences which they may have within thirty (30) days
following the receipt by Purchaser of the Statement of Objections. If the
parties are unable to reach an agreement as to such amounts and
adjustments within such thirty (30) day period, then the matter shall be
submitted as promptly as practicable to PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if
PricewaterhouseCoopers is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, to
such other independent accounting firm agreed to by the parties (such
accountant, the "Settlement Accountant"), who shall resolve the matters (and
only such matters) still in dispute and establish the Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Working Capital Amount; provided, however, that the Settlement
Accountant may not (x) assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or
Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item
assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, (y)
determine an amount of Closing Working Capital in excess of that claimed by
Seller or less than that claimed by Purchaser or (z) determine an amount of
Indebtedness in excess of that claimed by Purchaser or less than that claimed
by Seller. The Settlement Accountant\'s determination shall be based solely
on presentations by Purchaser and/or Seller which are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this    2    Agreement. The
Settlement Accountant shall make such determination within forty-five (45)
days following the submission of the matter to the Settlement Accountant for
resolution, and such determination shall be final and binding upon Seller and
Purchaser and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Seller and Purchaser agree that neither party will have any right to, and
will not, institute any action of any kind challenging such determination,
except that the foregoing shall not preclude an action to enforce such
determination. With respect to any particular matter addressed by
this Section 1.2, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification under Article VIII to the extent that such matter has been
otherwise specifically addressed and resolved pursuant to an adjustment under
this Section 1.2.   (c) In the event any dispute is submitted to the
Settlement Accountant for resolution as provided in Section 1.2(b) of this
Agreement, the fees, charges and expenses of the Settlement Accountant shall
be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser.   (d) In the event
that the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 is
greater than the Estimated Purchase Price (such excess, the "Excess"),
Purchaser shall pay to Seller within five (5) Business Days of the
determination of the Excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to such Excess, together with interest thereon for the period
from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment,
at the prime rate as quoted in the Money Rates Section of The Wall Street
Journal on the Closing Date (the "Applicable Rate").   (e) In the event that
the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.2 is less
than the Estimated Purchase Price (such deficiency, the "Deficiency"), Seller
shall pay to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days of the determination of
the Deficiency, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to such Deficiency, together with interest thereon for the period from
(and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment, at
the Applicable Rate.   (f) If any amount is required to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1.2 and is paid later than the dates specified in Section 1.2(d)
or Section 1.2(e), interest at a rate of the Applicable Rate plus 5% per
annum (e.g., if the Applicable Rate is 3.0%, the interest rate applied
pursuant to this Section 1.2(f) shall be 8.0% per annum) shall be added to
such amount, for the period from (and including) such fifth (5th) Business
Day following the determination of the final amounts to (but excluding) the
date of payment.   ARTICLE II  The Closing   SECTON 2.1 Closing Date. The
closing of the sale and transfer of the Interests (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Troutman Sanders LLP, 600 Peachtree Street, N.E.,

Ancillary Documents to  which Seller is a party; and   (iii) such other

liabilities that are not otherwise  expressly provided for in this

a foreign company, as the case may be, in the jurisdictions set forth in
Schedule 3.1, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is transacting

Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.2 Authority.   (a) The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Seller and the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or limited liability company action on the part of Seller

by Seller and the Company at the Closing will be duly executed and delivered
by Seller and the Company at the Closing and when so executed and delivered

Company, as the case may be, enforceable against such party in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally, and except that the availability of the remedy of
specific performance or other equitable relief is subject to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.   (b) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the Company, and the
execution and delivery by Seller and the Company of the Ancillary Documents
to be executed by Seller and the Company at the Closing, the consummation by

set forth on Schedule 3.2(b) and (B) in the case of clause (ii), for any such
conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(c), no consent,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by either
Seller or the Company in connection with the execution and   
5    delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for
(i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, and (ii) those the failure
of which to obtain or make would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.3

liability company interests of the Company. The authorized, issued
and outstanding limited liability company interests of the Company are as set
forth on the attached Schedule 3.3, and except as set forth in Schedule 3.3,

in the Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3, and except for the

compliance with all laws, regulations, rules and orders of all Governmental
Entities applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, except where the

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from a Governmental
Entity alleging any non-compliance in any material respect with any such
laws, regulations, rules or orders. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has at any time made any bribes, kickback payments,

program, policy or arrangement, in each case currently maintained or
contributed to by Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on behalf
of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (all the foregoing

any of their affiliates maintains, contributes to or has any liability or
obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Section 302

Company has made available to Purchaser true and correct copies of (A) each
Seller Benefit Plan or (B) the most recent summary plan description

under any Environmental Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not

transported, handled, exposed any Person to, or released any Hazardous
Substance, or owned or operated any property or facility (and no such
property, including the Leased Real Property, is contaminated by any
Hazardous Substance) so as to give rise to any material liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) or obligations pursuant to any Environmental Law.
Seller has furnished to Purchaser all environmental audits, reports and other
material environmental documents relating to the past or current properties,
facilities or operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their

to the Company, and the Company have filed all material Tax Returns that they
were required to file. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all

Tax Return. Neither Seller, with respect to the Company, nor the Company has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency.   (b)

the Company, is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are
no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the

the Company, have withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid, and all required forms have been properly completed
and timely filed.    13    (c) No foreign, federal, state, or local tax
audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are pending or being
conducted with respect to the Company or the Seller, with respect to the
Company. Neither the Company nor the Seller, with respect to the Company, has
received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority
(including jurisdictions where neither the Company nor the Seller, with
respect to the Company, has filed Tax Returns) any written (i) notice
indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for
information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by
any taxing authority against the Company or the Seller, with respect to the
Company.   (d) Neither the Company nor the Seller, with respect to the
Company, is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has

foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.  
(e) Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor the
Seller, with respect to the Company, has incurred any material liability for

such laws, regulations, rules and orders relating to wages, hours, collective
bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, immigration,
workers\' compensation, layoffs, and the collection and payment of
withholding Taxes and similar Taxes, except where    14    the failure
to be in compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonable likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (d) The listed
persons on Schedule 11.1(a) do not have any actual knowledge that any
executive or any key employee of the Company (other than himself or herself)
or any group of employees of the Company has any plans to terminate his or

of its Subsidiaries have received any written notice, or to the Knowledge of
Seller, oral statement from any supplier or customer listed on Schedule 3.19
that such supplier or customer intends to (or is considering or evaluating
whether to) after the date of this Agreement (a) stop or materially decrease
the rate of, or materially and adversely change the terms with respect to,

services to the Company with respect to which practical alternative sources
of supply or service are not generally available on comparable terms and
conditions in the marketplace.   SECTION 3.20 Products.   (a) During the
past two (2) years, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
suffered any material product liability or product warranty claims or any
product recalls. Neither Seller, the Company nor any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries has received any adverse written or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
any oral, notice within the past two (2) years that any Governmental Entity
has commenced, or has threatened to initiate, any action to withdraw
its approval or request the recall of any product of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.   (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, there are no
products being marketed, distributed, manufactured, sold or otherwise

have a Material Adverse Effect, all products commercially distributed by the
Company in any jurisdiction meet the applicable legal requirements of such
jurisdiction with respect to manufacture, sale, labeling, storing, testing,
distribution and marketing. Seller has made available to Purchaser all
written communications between Seller and/or the Company and the FDA or any
other Governmental Entity with respect to legal compliance matters involving

reports or other submissions to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity
prepared or maintained to comply with the requirements of the foregoing with
respect to the Business. Neither Seller nor the Company has committed any
act, made any statement or failed to make any statement that would breach in
material respect the FDA\'s policy with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements
of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities" set forth in 56 Fed. Reg.
46191 (September 10, 1991) and any amendments thereto. Neither the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof, nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any officer or key

exclusion under 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7 or any similar law or regulation.

in the aggregate, would not materially impair the ability of Purchaser to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.   (c) No consent, approval,
license, permit, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by
Purchaser in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, except for (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR

perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.  
SECTION 4.3 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no claim,
action, suit proceeding or governmental investigation pending or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser, by or before any

acknowledges that any information being provided to it or its Representatives
by Seller or any of its affiliates or Representatives pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.  
SECTION 5.3 HSR Act Filings.   Each of Purchaser and Seller shall on July
28, 2006, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice, the notification and report form under the HSR
Act required for the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent that the
parties have not filed such notification and report form prior the execution
of this Agreement) and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Each party will bear its own costs for the
preparation of any such filing and responding to any inquiries or information
requests, and Purchaser and Seller shall be responsible on a 50/50 basis for
the payment of any applicable filing fees.   SECTION 5.4 Expenses.  
Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection

counsel, lenders, financial advisors and other representatives

books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts and other properties and
assets of the Company that it and its Representatives have requested, and
(ii) the opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of the Company
to discuss the Business. Purchaser also acknowledges that it has conducted
its own independent review and analysis of the Company. Seller acknowledges
and agrees, however, that nothing in this Section 5.6, or otherwise, shall
affect Purchaser\'s right to rely on the representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement.   SECTION 5.7 Cooperation of the Parties;
Regulatory Approvals.   Purchaser and Seller shall be responsible for
obtaining all regulatory approvals necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (with it being understood that
Purchaser and Seller shall be responsible on a 50/50 basis for the payment of
any applicable filing fees relating to the HSR Act or any other regulatory
filing fees). The parties shall cooperate with each other and with their
respective Representatives in connection with any acts or actions required to
be taken as part of or as a condition to their respective obligations under
this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and all applicable laws and regulations, each of the
parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions to the Closing and to do or cause to be done
all things necessary to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the execution
and delivery of all agreements required hereunder to be so executed and
delivered. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to give any required
notices of this transaction to third parties under the Material Contracts and
to obtain the Third Party Approvals.   SECTION 5.8 Ancillary Documents.  
Seller and Purchaser agree to execute and deliver at Closing a
Transition Services Agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the
"Transition Services Agreement") (the "Ancillary Documents").   
22     SECTION 5.9 Notification.   Each party shall give prompt written
notice to the other parties of (i) any breach of any of its representations
or warranties contained in Articles III or IV, as the case may be, (ii) any
breach of any covenant hereunder by such party and (iii) any other material
development affecting the ability of such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that (A) in the case of
clause (i) or (ii) above, if the matter or matters described in such written
notice shall have, individually or in the aggregate, resulted or would be
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, Purchaser
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, in accordance with
Section 7.1(a)(vi), in which event the parties shall not have any further
obligations or liabilities to one another except as otherwise provided herein
and (B) such written notice shall not be deemed to have amended or
supplemented any section of the Schedules or modified any representation or
warranty or covenant or cured any breach of representation, warranty or
covenant for purposes of determining Purchaser\'s right to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2.   SECTION 5.10 Post-Closing Access
to Information.   (a) Following the Closing Date for a period of seven (7)
years thereafter, Purchaser shall upon reasonable notice by Seller (a) afford
promptly to Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books and records, facilities, Contracts,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and (b) furnish to Seller or
any Subsidiary of Seller such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Company that is reasonably available to the
Company, provided that, (i) such access is (A) in connection with any third
party audit, investigation, dispute or litigation not involving the Company
or its Subsidiaries and/or (B) necessary to comply with any applicable legal
requirements or any request of a Governmental Authority and (ii) such access
is with respect to any period ending on or before the Closing Date and for
any period beginning on or prior to and ending after the Closing Date.  
(b) Following the Closing, Purchaser (or an affiliate of Purchaser) may seek
to issue debt or equity securities the issuance of which may require the
preparation of an offering document or registration statement (the
"Offering Document"), which Offering Document might be required to include
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"S-X Financials"). Accordingly, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser any
information or documents reasonably available to Seller that are necessary
for completion of the S-X Financials and Seller agrees, following the
Closing, to execute any reasonably requested management representation
letters and certifications (it being understood that Seller shall not be
required to make any untrue representations or certifications therein) to
permit Purchaser\'s independent accountants to issue unqualified reports with
respect to the S-X Financials to be included in the Offering Document and any
amendments thereto. In addition, Seller will make available its personnel and
otherwise provide support in connection with the preparation of the Offering
Document and the S-X Financials to the extent reasonably requested by
Purchaser; provided that, in connection with any request under this Section
5.10(b) Purchaser shall reimburse any reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by Seller in complying with such request. In addition, upon the request of
Purchaser, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause KPMG,
LLP (Seller\'s accountants) to    23    agree to be engaged by
Purchaser, its Affiliates and/or its independent accountants (at the cost and
expense of Purchaser, its Affiliates and/or its independent accountants) to
assist in preparing and to support the preparation of the Offering Document,
the S-X Financials and the unqualified reports of Purchaser\'s independent
accountants with respect thereto and to provide to Purchaser, its Affiliates
and/or its independent accountants the work papers and other information and
documents in the possession of KPMG, LLP related to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (subject to execution and delivery by Purchaser of a customary
hold harmless letter in favor of the Person(s) preparing such work papers).
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller\'s Indemnified Persons
from and against any and all claims, liabilities or Losses arising out of,
based upon or relating to the Offering Document and/or the S-X Financials.  
SECTION 5.11 Tax Matters.   (a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for (i) any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
(a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") that are due (including extensions) after the
Closing Date and (ii) for any taxable period beginning on or prior to and
ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, Seller shall treat items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the prior practices and positions of the Company.
Seller shall deliver such Straddle Period Tax Returns to the Purchaser
fifteen days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns for Purchaser\'s
review. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period").  
(b) Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify the
Company, Purchaser and its affiliates and hold them harmless from and against
any Losses attributable to (A) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including any Taxes related to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any Straddle Period, (B) all Taxes of any member of an
Affiliated Group of which the Company or Seller (or any predecessor of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law or regulation), and (C) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company or Seller, with respect to the Company, as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing Date. The indemnification under this Section 5.11 shall
not be subject to the indemnification deductible and other limitations set
forth in Section 8.4(a). Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any Taxes of
the Company or any Subsidiary which are the responsibility of Seller pursuant
to this Section 5.11 at least 5 days prior to the payment of such Taxes by
Purchaser or the Company. Purchaser shall be responsible all Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Periods, including any
Taxes relating to the post-closing portion of any Straddle Period. In the
case of any Straddle Period, (i) income taxes or other Taxes based on
receipts shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (provided, however, that items such as
depreciation shall be calculated in a matter described as item (ii) of this
sentence) and (ii) any other Taxes shall be apportioned between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post Closing Tax Period based on a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period   
24    ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days during the taxable period.   (c) Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, Purchaser, without Seller\'s prior written
consent shall not file, nor allow to be filed, any amended Tax Return of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any
Straddle Period.   (d) Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, agree to give prompt notice, in reasonable detail, to each other of any
dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of Seller (with respect to the
Company), the Company or its Subsidiaries claimed or raised by any
Governmental Entity (a "Tax Claim") with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. In the case of any Tax Claim relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and
shall have the right to settle such Tax Claim without the consent of the
Purchaser; provided, however, such settlement shall not adversely affect the
Purchaser for any Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period. In the case of any
Tax Claim relating to the Taxes of any Straddle Period, Seller and Purchaser
may each participate in the audit or proceeding at their own expense, and the
audit or proceeding shall be controlled by the party who would bear the
burden of the greatest portion of the adjustment; provided, however, that the
party controlling the Straddle Period Tax Claim shall not settle such audit
or proceeding without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. In the case of any Tax Claim relating to the Taxes
of any Post-Closing Period or any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and shall have the right to
settle such Tax Claim without the consent of Seller; provided, however, such
settlement shall not adversely affect the Seller for any Taxes for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period.   (e) Any Tax refund or overpayment (including any
interest in respect thereof) relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be for the
account of Seller (and any such Tax refund, if received by the Purchaser,
shall be payable to the Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
Purchaser\'s receipt) and any Tax refund or overpayment (including any
interest in respect thereof) relating to any Post-Closing Tax Period or the
post-Closing portion of any Straddle Period shall be for the account of
Purchaser (and any such Tax refund, if received by Seller, shall be payable
to Purchaser within fifteen (15) Business Days of the Purchaser\'s
receipt).   (f) Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, examination, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Seller and the Purchaser agree, upon request, to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereunder).   (g) Purchaser shall prepare an
allocation of the purchase price consideration and the liabilities (and all
other capitalized costs) of the Company and its Subsidiaries among the   
25    assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Acquired Assets")
in accordance with the allocation principles set forth on Schedule 5.11(g).
Purchaser shall deliver such allocation to Seller within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall report, act,
and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such
allocation prepared by Purchaser (except as provided below). Seller shall
timely and properly prepare, execute, file, and deliver all such documents,
forms, and other information as Purchaser may reasonably request in preparing
such allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall not take any position (whether in
audits, tax returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation
unless required to do so by applicable law. If Seller disagrees with any
material aspect of the allocation of the Purchase Price described in this
Section 5.11(g) or any other material aspect of the required forms, Seller
and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such disagreement
within ten (10) days. If Seller and Purchaser cannot resolve any
disagreement, the matter shall be referred to the Settlement Accountant. The
Settlement Accountant will have thirty (30) days to carry out a review
pursuant to such procedures as it may require and prepare a written statement
of its determination regarding the disputed item(s) which shall be final and
binding upon the parties. Any cost, fees and expenses of the Settlement
Accountant incurred in resolving the disputed item(s) pursuant to this
Section 5.11(g) shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by
Seller. Purchaser and Seller agree to act in accordance with the decision of
such Settlement Accountant in the preparation, filing, and audit of any Tax
Return.   (h) Except to the extent such treatment is inconsistent with
other provisions of this Agreement, any payments made by Purchaser or Seller
to the other party pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by both
Purchaser and Seller for income tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.   (i) Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, Purchaser and
the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.  
SECTION 5.12 Obligations with Respect to Employees of the Company.   (a)
Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause all of the active
employees of the Company (referred to herein as "Transferred Employees") to
remain employed by (or remain the responsibility of, as applicable)
the Company as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause the Company to
employ Transferred Employees in comparable positions and at comparable rates
of total cash compensation (including base salary and sales commission
arrangements, as applicable), as in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and shall provide Transferred Employees with benefits (except for
equity arrangements) which are in the aggregate similar to those provided by
Seller to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes
of this Section 5.12, the term "active employees" shall include all full-time
and part-time employees, employees on military leave, maternity leave, short-
term disability and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. No
individual who retires or has retired or otherwise terminates or has
terminated employment as an employee of the Company on or prior to the
Closing Date (each a "Former Employee") shall be deemed to be a Transferred
Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of Purchaser, the
Company, or any    26    of their affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee at any time following the Closing Date
and for any reason, including without cause, or limit the ability of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their affiliates to amend or change its
benefit plans or programs or the providers thereof, or (subject to the terms
of any applicable employment agreements) to change any other employment
terms; provided, however, that: (i) Purchaser shall be responsible for any
severance compensation, change in control payments or other liabilities
arising as a result of such termination and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller\'s Indemnified Persons from any and
all liabilities arising from such actions. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall not enforce against any Transferred Employee any non-
solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality or nondisclosure obligation
that any such Transferred Employee owes to Seller or any Subsidiary thereof
if, by so enforcing any such obligation against such Transferred Employee,
the performance capabilities of such Transferred Employee with respect to the
Company and/or the Business would be restricted, limited or otherwise
adversely affected (with it being understood that Seller may enforce any such
obligations against any Transferred Employee to the extent such obligations
relate to operations of the Seller that are not related to the Business).  
(b) Purchaser will give credit for prior service with Seller and the Company
with respect to vacation benefits, severance benefits and for purposes of
determining participation and vesting service under the applicable
employee benefit plans, arrangements or other perquisites of Purchaser.  
(c) Except to the extent provided herein or in the Transition
Services Agreement, Transferred Employees shall not accrue benefits under any
Seller Benefit Plan after the later of the Closing Date or the date specified
in such Seller Benefit Plan. Any Transferred Employee who is on short term
disability or on a leave of absence of the type described in Section 5.12(a)
above shall remain the liability of Seller and shall continue to receive
benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans (as applicable) until such time as
the Transferred Employee actively returns to work with the Company. Seller
shall remain solely liable for the payment of any and all wages, salaries,
bonuses, incentives and compensation of any kind payable to any Transferred
Employee for any period ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent
properly accrued and reflected on the Closing Statement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser agrees that Seller will have no liability for the payment of
any management bonuses with respect to any period beginning on or after
January 1, 2006. Purchaser shall cause the Company to assume the accrued
vacation pay of any Transferred Employee to the extent properly accrued and
reflected on the Closing Statement.   (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall
cause duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to a
Transferred Employee under any employee benefit policies, plans,
arrangements, programs, practices, or agreements. References herein to a
benefit with respect to a Transferred Employee shall include, where
applicable, benefits with respect to any eligible dependents
and beneficiaries of such Transferred Employee under the same employee
benefit policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement.   (e)
Any individual who would otherwise be a "Transferred Employee" but who is
receiving or entitled to receive long-term disability benefits under
any Seller Benefit Plan on or prior to the Closing Date shall become or
remain the sole responsibility of Seller and shall    27    not be
considered a Transferred Employee for any purpose hereunder, unless and until
such individual becomes reemployed by the Company on or before December 31,
2006.   (f) As soon as practical after the Closing Date, but not later than
90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish a savings plan to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "Purchaser Savings Plan").
Each Transferred Employee who was eligible to participate in the Seller
Savings Plan shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser Savings Plan
on or after the effective date of the Purchaser Savings Plan. As soon as
practical after the establishment of the Purchaser Savings Plan, Seller shall
cause the trustees of the Seller Savings Plan to transfer to the trustees of
the Purchaser Savings Plan, and Purchaser shall cause the trustees of the
Purchaser Savings Plan to accept, the amounts representing the account
balances (both vested and unvested) of the Transferred Employees as of the
Closing Date plus gains and losses through the actual date of transfer (the
"Transfer Date"). Such account balances shall be transferred in cash except
that the portion of any such account that is attributable to a participant
loan shall be transferred in kind. Seller and Purchaser agree not to place
any participant loan with respect to the transferred accounts into default
during the period beginning on the Closing Date through the Transfer Date, as
long as each participant continues making loan repayments on a timely basis,
in accordance with reasonable procedures acceptable to Seller during such
period.   (g) Seller shall be solely responsible and liable for any and
all claims under any Seller Benefit Plan incurred on, prior to or after the
Closing Date by any Former Employee, Transferred Employee, or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) a claim for
health benefits (including, without limitation, claims for medical,
prescription drug and dental expenses) will be deemed to have been incurred
on the date on which the related medical service or material was rendered to
or received by the individual claiming such benefit, (ii) a claim for
sickness, accident or disability benefits based on an injury or illness
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date will be deemed to have been
incurred prior the Closing Date, and (iii) in the case of any claim for
benefits other than health benefits and sickness, accident or disability
benefits (e.g., life insurance benefits), a claim will be deemed to have been
incurred upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to such claim.   (h)
Seller shall become and remain solely responsible and liable for satisfying
the continuation coverage requirements for group health plans under Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") for
(i) all Former Employees (and their respective beneficiaries and
dependents) who are receiving COBRA continuation coverage as of the Closing
Date and (ii) all Former Employees and Transferred Employees (and their
respective beneficiaries and dependents) who are entitled to elect such
coverage on account of a qualifying event occurring on or before the date
group health plan coverage ceases under the Transition Services Agreement.
Effective as of the date group health plan coverage ceases under the
Transition Services Agreement, all Transferred Employees who participated in
a group health plan shall become eligible to participate in a group health
plan (as defined for purposes of COBRA) which shall be established and
maintained by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall be responsible and liable for
satisfying the continuation coverage requirements under COBRA for all
Transferred Employees (and their respective beneficiaries and dependents) who
are entitled to elect such coverage on account of a qualifying event
occurring after the date group health plan coverage ceases under the
Transition Services Agreement.    28     (i) Nothing in this Section
5.12, express or implied, shall create a third party beneficiary relationship
or otherwise confer any benefit, entitlement, or right upon any Person other
than the parties hereto.   (j) Seller and its affiliates shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons from (i) any and all
liabilities under any Seller Benefit Plan and any other employee benefit plan
of any Person that together with the Company constitutes a controlled group
of entities with the Company under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, (ii) any and all employment and employee benefits-related claims of
Former Employees arising at any time, and (iii) any and all employment and
employee benefits-related claims of Transferred Employees for time periods
ending on the Closing Date. Except for liabilities retained by Seller under
Seller Benefit Plans, Purchaser and its affiliates shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller\'s Indemnified Persons from any and all liabilities under
any employee benefit plan covering Transferred Employees after the Closing
Date and from any and all employment and employee benefits-related claims of
Transferred Employees for time periods beginning on the Closing Date.   (k)
Purchaser and Seller agree that the payroll tax reporting obligations of the
Transferred Employees shall be treated in accordance with the Alternate
Procedure of Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53.   SECTION 5.13
Resignation.   As of the Closing, Seller shall cause each Person nominated
by Seller who serves as an officer, manager, director or in any other similar
capacity of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof to deliver a written
resignation from all such positions with the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof effective as of the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.14 Distributions.  
Subject to Section 5.20 below, nothing contained herein shall prevent
or impair Seller\'s rights to cause the Company to make lawful distributions
to Seller consistent with past practices of any income properly received by
the Company from and after the date of this Agreement until Closing.  
SECTION 5.15 Payment of Company Indebtedness; Releases.   On the Closing
Date, Seller will cause all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including any inter-company liabilities owed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to Seller or any of its Affiliates) to be paid in full
or extinguished. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall obtain a
release of the Company from any and all liabilities and obligations under the
Bank of America Revolver and Term Loan, including, but not limited to, a
release of the Company as a guarantor under the Bank of America Revolver and
Term Loan and a release of any and all liens encumbering any of the assets of
the Company in connection with the Bank of America Revolver and Term
Loan.   SECTION 5.16 Guarantees of Seller.    29     The parties
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts in order
that, effective as of the Closing Date, any and all guarantees, deposits,
letters of credit, assurances or similar obligations of Seller or any of its
Affiliates set forth on Schedule 5.16 in respect of any obligations
or liabilities of the Company (collectively, the "Seller Guarantees") shall
be released. Purchaser or the Company shall execute any customary
substitute guarantees and make any other reasonable arrangements on the part
of Purchaser or the Company necessary to obtain the release of any such
Seller Guarantees as of the Closing Date. If the parties are unable to cause
any of the Seller Guarantees to be released prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its respective affiliates from
and against any and all amounts becoming payable under or with respect to any
such Seller Guarantees following the Closing.   SECTION 5.17 Exclusivity.
Until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(a) or the Closing, Seller and the Company will not, and Seller and the
Company will cause their respective Affiliates, representatives (including,
without limitation, investment bankers and other advisors), officers,
employees, directors or agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i) submit,
solicit, initiate, invite, encourage or discuss any proposal or offer from
any Person (other than the Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) or enter into any agreement or accept any offer relating
to or consummate any (a) reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
recapitalization of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) merger
or consolidation involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, (c) purchase or
sale of any assets or capital stock (or any rights to acquire, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, any such capital stock) of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or (d) similar transaction or business combination
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or
assets (each of the foregoing transactions described in clauses (a) through
(d), a "Company Transaction") or (ii) furnish any information (including
information contained in any electronic dataroom) with respect to, assist or
participate in or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any
Person (other than the Purchaser) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing.
Seller and the Company will, and will cause their related parties to,
terminate all discussions with all third parties (other than Purchaser and
its affiliates) regarding any of the foregoing (and will prohibit any such
third parties\' access rights to any electronic data room relating to the
Company). The Company, its Affiliates and the Seller agree to notify the
Purchaser immediately if any Person makes any proposal or offer, with respect
to a Company Transaction. Seller shall not vote, in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of the Company, in favor of such Company Transaction.   SECTION
5.18 Actions Prior to Closing.   On or before Closing, the Company will
assign to Seller all of its rights, title and interest in and to (i) the
Retention Agreements listed on Schedule 5.18 and (ii) the Lease Agreement by
and between Gainor Medical USA, Inc. and Century-Lenze Development, LLC dated
November 12, 1996 (the "Vacated McDonough Lease"). Seller will assume all
liabilities and obligations of the Company under the Retention Agreements and
the Vacated McDonough Lease and will discharge its obligations under the
Retention Agreements and the Vacated McDonough Lease. Seller and Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the landlord
under the Vacated McDonough Lease prior to Closing. However, in the event
that such consent is not obtained prior to Closing, then the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, such further actions
as reasonably necessary to evidence and    30    effectuate an
alternative agreement which relieves the Company of the burdens
of performance and other obligations thereunder. On or prior to the Closing,
Seller shall enter into an assignment, the effect of which is to convey title
of the Trade Show Booth to the Company.   SECTION 5.19 Bank Accounts;
Collection of Accounts Receivable.   On or prior to Closing, Seller shall
cause the Company to cooperate with Purchaser\'s efforts to establish at the
Company as of the Closing separate (a) bank accounts and (b) lock boxes for
the remittance of Accounts Receivable in the name of the Company for the
purpose of remitting, after the Closing, Accounts Receivable directly to the
Company rather than to bank accounts and lock boxes controlled by Seller. If
at any time on or after the Closing Date, Seller receives any payment on any
Accounts Receivable, or other asset which the Company is entitled after the
Closing, then Seller shall promptly forward within two (2) Business Days of
the receipt the amount of such payment or asset, along with copies of any
remittances or other documentation accompanying such payment, to the
Company.   SECTION 5.20 Cap Ex Shortfall.   For the period beginning on
July 1, 2006 and ending on the Closing Date, the Company will make capital
expenditures in an amount equal to $218,000 (the "Cap Ex Contribution"), with
it being understood that such amount is intended to be used by the Company to
fund certain capital expenditures committed to by the Company prior to the
date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 5.14 above, Seller shall not cause the Company to
distribute any portion of such Cap Ex Contribution to Seller unless an
additional contribution by Seller (or an additional retention of earnings by
the Company) offsets the amount of such distribution. For purposes of Section
1.1(a) above, if prior to the Closing, the Company makes capital expenditures
pursuant to this Section 5.20 in an amount less than $218,000, the amount of
any such shortfall shall be deemed to be the "Cap Ex Shortfall."   ARTICLE

all Losses arising out of, based upon or relating to:   (a) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or any of the
Schedules attached hereto or in any certificate delivered by Seller to
Purchaser pursuant to Article VI above (other than to the extent the subject
matter of any such representation or warranty is otherwise covered by Section
8.2(c) below);   (b) the nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or other
obligation of Seller set forth in this Agreement or any of the Schedules or

obligation or cause of action (including all contract claims, tort claims,
statutory claims, controversies, actions, declaratory judgment actions,
cross-claims, counterclaims, demands, equitable relief, whether in law or in
equity, whether past, present or future and whether or not now or heretofore
known, suspected or claimed, matured or unmatured) of the Seller or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller against the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates (including Purchaser and Water Street
Capital Partners, L.P.), relating to, or arising from, any matter existing at
or prior to the Closing, that involves, arises from or is related to (i)
Seller\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' direct or indirect ownership
of securities of the Company, (ii) any intercompany debts or other
obligations owed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries, (iii) any management, administrative or advisory
services provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) any other relationship between Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (but excluding
Seller\'s rights under this Agreement and any of the other agreements
executed and delivered in connection herewith and any obligations or
liabilities arising out of the on-going commercial relationship between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and EU Medical); provided, however, that
Seller reserves the right, in the event the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries asserts any claim against the Seller, its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, to make any counterclaim against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which counterclaim shall not be subject to the
indemnification obligations of this Section 8.2(d).    38     SECTION
8.3 Indemnification by Purchaser.   Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates
("Seller\'s Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Losses arising
out of, based upon or relating to:   (a) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement or any of the Schedules attached
hereto or in any certificate delivered by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to
Article VI above; or   (b) the nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or
other obligation of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or any of the
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto.   SECTION 8.4 Indemnification
Limitations.   (a) Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons may not assert any Claim
for Losses under Section 8.2(a) (other than with respect to the
Fundamental Representations) until the aggregate amount of all such Claims
under this Agreement exceeds $850,000 (the "Deductible"), and then
Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons may only assert Claims for the excess of
such aggregate Claims over such amount. In no event shall the aggregate
liability of Seller for all Claims for Losses under Section 8.2(a) (other
than with respect to the Fundamental Representations and other than with
respect to the Intellectual Property Representations included in Section
3.12(c) as the same relate to Intellectual Property Rights under issued
patents) exceed $12,500,000 (but with it being understood, however, that
nothing in this Agreement (including this Section 8.4) shall limit or
restrict any of the Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons\' right to maintain or
recover any amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon
intentional misrepresentation or fraud). No Claim for Losses under
Section 8.2(a) may be made, and no Losses shall be applied against the
Deductible set forth above, with respect to any Claim or group of similar or
related Claims that does not cause Losses in excess of $50,000, exclusive of
attorneys\' fees, court costs and costs of litigation. For purposes of
determining whether there has been any breach of a representation or warranty
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII and for purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses with respect thereto, such representations
and warranties alleged to have been breached shall be construed as if any
qualification or limitation with respect to materiality, whether by reference
to the terms "material," "in all material respects," "in any material
respect," "Material Adverse Effect," or any similar words or phrases, were
omitted from the text of such representations and warranties (it being
understood that for purposes of determining whether a breach of a
representation or warranty constitutes intentional misrepresentation or fraud
that such qualifications and limitations with respect to materiality, whether
by reference to the terms "material," "in all material respects," "in any
material respect," "Material Adverse Effect," or any similar words
or phrases, shall not be omitted from the text of such representations
and warranties).   (b) All Losses recoverable by an Indemnified Party under
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 shall be net of insurance proceeds and recoveries
from third parties actually received by such Indemnified Party. If such
Losses are covered by a Pre-Closing Insurance Policy, Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate with Seller, at Seller\'s request and at
Seller\'s    39    expense, in any reasonable manner in connection with
Seller\'s efforts to recover the amount of available coverage from the
applicable insurer (but with it being understood that Seller\'s
indemnification obligations hereunder shall not be contingent upon or
otherwise subject to any such insurance recovery). In addition, and for the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that neither Purchaser
nor the Company shall have any obligation to seek to recover any amounts
under insurance policies purchased at or after the Closing in order to
mitigate or otherwise reduce the amount of any Losses. Purchaser and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable and good faith efforts
consistent with reasonable business judgment to collect amounts that may be
reasonably recoverable from third parties in respect of Losses (and shall
exercise substantially the same degree of effort and prudence that such
parties would be expected to exercise under the circumstances if such Losses
were not recoverable under Section 8.2), but (i) such efforts shall not
include any requirement of Purchaser or the Company to commence any
litigation or arbitration proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party and (ii) Seller\'s
indemnification obligations hereunder shall not be contingent upon or
otherwise subject to any such third party recovery.   (c) The amount of any
indemnification payment related to a Loss arising under Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3 shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax savings actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss in the taxable year in which such Loss is incurred or in any
preceding taxable year as a result of the use of net operating loss
carrybacks. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party shall (i) be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction, or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of
any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of
any indemnified Loss and (ii) take into account any related tax costs and
expenses. In the event that the Indemnified Party does not realize any net
Tax savings in the taxable year in which such Loss is incurred (or in any
preceding taxable year), but does realize a net Tax savings in any of the two
subsequent years, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such net Tax savings when actually
realized.   SECTION 8.5 Manner of Payment. Any indemnification of the
Purchaser\'s Indemnified Persons or the Seller\'s Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Article VIII shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may
be, to an account designated by any Purchaser\'s Indemnified Person or
Seller\'s Indemnified Person, as the case may be, within 15 days after the
determination thereof. Any such indemnification payments shall include
interest at the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over 360, from the date any such Loss is suffered or
sustained to the date of payment.   SECTION 8.6 Claims.   (a) Upon the
occurrence of any event that a party hereto (the "Indemnified Party") asserts
to be the basis for a claim for indemnification against the other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") under this Article VIII (a "Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall promptly give notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party
thereof in writing, which Claim Notice shall set forth (i) a particular
description of the event or condition that is the basis for the Claim; and
(ii) the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Claim; provided, that,
the failure to so    40    notify an Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have caused the
Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to be greater than such
Losses would have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party
prompt notice hereunder.   (b) If the Claim involves the claim of any third
Person (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to assume and control the defense of the Third-Party Claim at such
Indemnifying Party\'s expense with counsel of its own choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, so long as the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party of such defense in writing within thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim;
provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming control of such
defense it shall first notify the Indemnified Party in writing that such
Indemnifying Party shall be fully responsible (with no reservation of any
rights) for all Losses relating to such Claim (but subject to the dollar
limitations otherwise set forth herein) and that it shall provide
indemnification (whether or not otherwise required hereunder but subject to
the dollar limitations otherwise set forth herein) to the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Claim; and provided further that:   (i) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel, at its  sole cost and expense, and
participate in the defense of the Third-Party  Claim, except that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party  shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if the  Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest  exists between
the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party; and   (ii) notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section  8.6(b), the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume control of  such defense (unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by the Indemnified  Party) if (A) the claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in  connection with any criminal or quasi criminal
proceeding, action,  indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) the claim
seeks an injunction  or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (C)
the Indemnified  Party has been advised by counsel that a conflict of
interest exists  between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party;
(D) upon petition  by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that
the Indemnifying  Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or
defend such claim;  (E) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the
Losses relating to  such claim for indemnification to be paid by the
Indemnified Party (taking  into account the dollar limitations otherwise set
forth herein) would  exceed the amount of Losses relating to such claim for
indemnification to  be paid by the Indemnifying Party (taking into account
the dollar  limitations otherwise set forth herein); or (F) the Third Party
Claim  involves one of the Company\'s customers or suppliers and the
Indemnified  Party reasonably believes that (and notifies Seller in writing
to the  effect that) an adverse determination with respect to the action,
lawsuit,  investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim
for  indemnification, or the defense thereof by the Indemnifying Party,
would  reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the
Indemnified  Party\'s relationship with such customer or supplier. In the
event (x) the  Indemnifying Party does not have the right to assume and
control the  defense of a Third-Party Claim    41     pursuant to this
Section 8.6(b)(ii), then the Indemnifying Party shall have  the right to
retain separate counsel, at its sole cost and expense, and  participate in
the defense of the Third-Party Claim and (y) the  Indemnifying Party does not
have the right to assume and control the  defense of a Third-Party Claim by
virtue of clause (F) of this Section  8.6(b)(ii), then the Indemnifying Party
shall only be responsible for 85%  of the Losses in respect of such Third
Party Claim that Seller would  otherwise be responsible for (and Purchaser or
the Company shall bear the  other 15%).   (c) So long as the Indemnifying
Party has assumed and is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim
pursuant to Section 8.6(b): (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by
the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable
relief upon the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).   (d) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not or does not
have the right to, assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 8.6(b), the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with or obtain any
consent from the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith). However, in the
event that the Indemnifying Party does not have the right to assume and
control the defense of a Third-Party Claim by virtue of clause (F) of Section
8.6(b)(ii) above, and the parties agree or a court of competent jurisdiction
has determined that any settlement entered into by the Indemnified Party and
its customer or supplier in connection therewith was not on commercially
reasonable terms, then the Indemnifying Party shall only be responsible for
the lesser of (i) 85% of the total amount of such settlement, and (ii) 100%
of the amount of the settlement that the parties agreed upon or the
aforementioned court determined was commercially reasonable (subject to the
dollar limitations otherwise set forth herein).   (e) Whenever the
Indemnified Party shall have given a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim for indemnification set
forth in such Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice"). If, with respect to the
claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice, no Dispute Notice is
given to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period, the Claim
shall be deemed valid, and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay
to the Indemnified Party the amount specified in the Claim Notice with
respect to such Claim.    42     SECTION 8.7 Exclusive Remedy. Other
than with respect to any action or claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation or fraud or any claim for injunctive or equitable relief,
Purchaser and Seller hereby acknowledge and agree that, from and after the
Closing, their sole remedy with respect to any and all claims arising under
this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Article VIII. In furtherance of (but subject to) the foregoing,
Purchaser and Seller and their respective related parties and affiliates
hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action they may have against
any other party hereto or its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and affiliates, except those arising pursuant to Sections 8.2
and 8.3, respectively.   SECTION 8.8 Certain Waivers. In no event shall the
Company have any liability to Seller whatsoever for any breaches of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants hereunder, and Seller
shall not in any event seek indemnification or contribution from the Company
for any breaches of the Company\'s obligation to Purchaser or in respect of
any payments required to be made by Seller pursuant to this Agreement.  
ARTICLE IX  Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.  
SECTION 9.1 Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation.   (a) Seller hereby acknowledges
that it is familiar with the Company\'s trade secrets and with other
Confidential Information. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Company
would be irreparably damaged if, during the Non-Compete Period, Seller or any
of its Affiliates were to compete with the Company or its Subsidiaries or
otherwise engage in a business similar to the business that is conducted by
the Company on the Closing Date, and that such competition by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries would result in a significant loss of the goodwill of the
Company and its Subsidiaries purchased by Purchaser hereunder. Seller further
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this
Section 9.1 were a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that Purchaser would
not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement
as specifically negotiated by the parties if Seller breached the provisions
of this Section 9.1. Therefore, in further consideration of the Purchase
Price to be paid to Seller hereunder for the Interests and the goodwill of
the Company and its Subsidiaries being sold by Seller, and for other good and
valuable consideration, Seller agrees that from the Closing Date until the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period") it shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates not to) directly or indirectly own any
interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as a partner, agent,
representative or otherwise), consult with, render services for, or in any
other manner engage in the Restricted Business anywhere in the world;
provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates from:   (i) distributing, marketing, supplying and selling
microsampling  devices or diabetes related components (including lancets,
lancing devices,  safety lancets and diagnostic lancets) to health plans or
individuals as a  part of its health enhancement, European diabetes supply or
women\'s health  business units;    43     (ii) engaging in the
marketing, supply or distribution (but not  the design, development,
manufacturing or assembly) of microsampling  devices or diabetes related
components (including lancets, lancing devices,  safety lancets and
diagnostic lancets) through EU Medical;   (iii) acquiring or combining with
a business (by merger or  otherwise), a component of which engages in the
Restricted Business so long  as the Restricted Business:   (A) does not
constitute more than $10,000,000 in annual sales as  of the date of
acquisition or combination; and   (B) does not exceed 25% of the annual
sales of the acquired  business as of the date of acquisition or combination;
provided, that  Seller and its Subsidiaries may also acquire or combine with
a  business or Person where a portion of such business or Person engages  in
the Restricted Business if both:   (1) the annual sales of such business
engaging in the  Restricted Business:   (x) does not exceed more than
$20,000,000 in annual  sales as of the date of acquisition or  combination,
and   (y) does not exceed 35% of the annual sales of the  acquired business
as of the date of acquisition or  combination; and   (2) Seller or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, uses reasonable  efforts to divest the portion of
such business engaging in the  Restricted Business within one (1) year after
its acquisition;  provided further, that Seller shall notify Purchaser and
give  Purchaser the opportunity to participate in the bidding or other 
process for such divesture or sale during such period on a basis 
substantially equal to the other interested parties and, if  Purchaser offers
an amount equal to or more than other interested  parties, will negotiate in
good faith to sell such business to  Purchaser;   (iv) being a passive
owner of not more than 5% of the outstanding  voting stock of a corporation
which is publicly traded and is engaged in  any aspect of the Restricted
Business; or   (v) fulfilling for the benefit of Purchaser or on its behalf
any  obligation pursuant to this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement.  For purposes hereof, the term "Restricted Business" means the
design, development, manufacture, assembly, marketing, supply or distribution
of microsampling devices or diabetes related components (including lancets,
lancing devices, safety lancets and diagnostic lancets).   (b)
Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary in Section 9.1(a) above,
during the Non-Compete Period, Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including for the avoidance of doubt, EU Medical) not
to, directly, or indirectly through another Person:   (i) induce or attempt
to induce any employee of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries to leave
the employ of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, or in any way   
44     interfere with the relationship between the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries and any employee thereof; provided, that the term "induce or 
attempt to induce" shall not include generalized, non-targeted searches for 
employees through: (A) the publication of an advertisement or other public 
announcement; or (B) the use of a recruiting or employment agency to which 
the name of an individual employed by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date has not been provided;   (ii) hire any person who was
employed by the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries either (A) in the
position of a Vice President or higher  or (B) at an annual salary in excess
of $75,000, in any case at any time  during the one hundred twenty (120) day
period immediately prior to the  date on which such hiring would take place
(it being conclusively presumed  so as to avoid any disputes under this
Section 9.1(b) that any such hiring  within such one hundred twenty (120) day
period is in violation of clause  (i) above); or   (iii) call on, solicit
or service any customer, supplier,  licensee, licensor or other business
relation of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries in order to induce or
attempt to induce such Person to cease  doing business with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or in any way  adversely interfere with the
relationship between any such customer,  supplier, licensee, licensor or
other business relation and the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries
(including making any negative statements or  communications about the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).   (c) If, at the time of enforcement of
the covenants contained in this Section 9.1 (the "Restrictive Covenants"), a
court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein
are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that
the court shall be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained
herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. Seller
has consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants and
based on such consultation has determined and hereby acknowledges that the
Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area
restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Company\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' business and the substantial investment in the Company
made by Purchaser hereunder. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the
Restrictive Covenants are being entered into by such Person in
connection with the sale by Seller of the goodwill of the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' business pursuant to this Agreement.   (d) The obligations
of Seller pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall terminate:   (i) As to any
Subsidiary of Seller and transferee of such  Subsidiary, upon the closing of
the sale of such Subsidiary, provided that  none of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates holds more than a 5%  equity interest in such
transferee;   (ii) As to any transferee of Seller or transferee of a
Subsidiary  of Seller who purchases a business or division of Seller or
such  Subsidiary, provided that none of Seller or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates  holds more than a 5% equity interest in such transferee;
and/or   (iii) In the event of a Change of Control. For purposes herein, a 
"Change of Control" shall mean (i) the consummation of a stock purchase 
transaction involving Seller\'s outstanding capital stock, a merger or 
consolidation of Seller with or into another    45     entity, or any
other corporate reorganization involving Seller, if, in any  such case,
Persons who were not stockholders of Seller immediately prior to  such
transaction, merger, consolidation or other reorganization own  immediately
after such transaction, merger, consolidation or other  reorganization more
than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding  securities of each of (A)
the continuing or surviving entity and (B) any  direct or indirect parent
corporation of such continuing or surviving  entity or (ii) the sale,
transfer or other disposition of all or  substantially all of the Seller\'s
consolidated assets.   (e) If Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a
breach of, any of the Restrictive Covenants, Purchaser shall have the right
and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any
court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or
threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury
to the Company and Purchaser and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to the Company or Purchaser. The foregoing rights and
remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to Purchaser at law or in equity.   (f) In the event of
any breach or violation by Seller of any of the Restrictive Covenants, the
time period of such covenant shall be tolled until such breach or violation
is resolved.   SECTION 9.2 Confidentiality.   (a) If the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, Seller agrees not to disclose or use at
any time (and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees and representatives not to use or
disclose at any time) any Confidential Information. The covenant contained in
the preceding sentence shall apply: (i) with respect to information and data
included in Confidential Information which constitutes a "trade secret" under
applicable law, at all times such information or data constitutes a "trade
secret" under applicable law and (ii) with respect to all other information
and data included in Confidential Information which does not constitute a
trade secret under applicable law, for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing Date.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge
and agree that "Confidential Information" does not include information which:
(i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, agents, employees and representatives in breach of this
Agreement; or (ii) becomes available to Seller or its Subsidiaries on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, agents, employees and
representatives.   (c) In the event that Seller is required by law to
disclose any Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify the Company
and Purchaser in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the
legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall
cooperate with Purchaser and the Company to preserve the confidentiality of
such information consistent with applicable law.    46     ARTICLE X

in sections corresponding to the sections and paragraphs of Article III shall

THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT

AND AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN
A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.  
SECTION 10.9 Publicity. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other
party or parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or
regulations of a national securities exchange in the United States, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other party or parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of its issuance. The parties agree that the initial
press release or releases with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this    49    Agreement shall be issued on the date hereof (or within
two (2) Business Days of the date hereof) and shall be mutually agreed upon
by the parties prior to the issuance thereof.   SECTION 10.10 Assignment.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder (including any rights, interests or obligations under Article VIII)
shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other party or parties hereto; provided, however, that Purchaser, (i) may
assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or in part, to any of its Affiliates (provided that (A) any assignment to
more than one Affiliate shall require the prior written consent of Seller
which shall not be unreasonably withheld and (B) such Affiliate(s) assumes
and agrees to perform, discharge and satisfy all of Purchaser\'s liabilities,
duties and obligations hereunder and Purchaser shall not be released and
shall remain primarily liable for and obligated to perform, discharge and
satisfy all of Purchaser\'s liabilities, duties and obligations hereunder);
(ii) at any time after Closing, may assign its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any
subsequent purchaser of Purchaser or a portion of its assets or business
(whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a
merger or otherwise) and (iii) may assign its rights, interests and
obligations for collateral security purposes, to any lender or lenders
providing financing to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the
date hereof and all extensions, renewals, replacements, refinancings and
