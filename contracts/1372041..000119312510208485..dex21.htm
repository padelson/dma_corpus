terms are defined in the Company Charter), respectively, with respect to such
share minus (y) such shares pro rata portion of the Senior Preferred SPP
Amount (which pro rata portion shall be determined by dividing such shares
Series C Liquidation Preference or Series D Liquidation Preference by the
aggregate amount of the Series C Liquidation Preference or Series D
Liquidation Preference payable with respect to all such shares). "Senior
Preferred Merger Consideration" shall mean the

 



 

17  aggregate amount payable to all holders of Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D Preferred Stock under this Section 2.4(c)(i).

 

(ii) _Junior Preferred Stock_. To the extent the Base Merger Consideration
exceeds the Senior Preferred Merger Consideration, each holder of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
(whether upon consummation of the Merger or upon the release of the portion
thereof held as Reserve Amount or Escrow Amount), upon the delivery of a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal, with respect to each share of Series A
Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, held by such
Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, ratably in
accordance with the Company Charter in proportion to the aggregate unpaid
Junior Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Company Charter) on all
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
(the aggregate amount payable to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock under this Section 2.4(c)(ii), the " _Junior
Preferred Merger Consideration_ ", and together with the Senior Preferred
Merger Consideration, the " _Preferred Stock Merger Consideration_ ").

(iii) _Common Stock_. To the extent the Base Merger Consideration exceeds the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, each holder of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive (whether upon consummation of the Merger or upon the
release of the portion thereof held as Reserve Amount or Escrow Amount), upon
the delivery of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, with respect to each
share of Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the Per Common Share Merger Consideration.

 

(iv) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each share of Common Stock that is held by a Company Stockholder
(i) who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing,
(ii) who shall have properly demanded in writing appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Section 262_ ") and (iii) who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
the right to such payment (each such share, a " _Dissenting Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive any portion of the consideration specified in Section 2.4,
but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Company Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 then the right of such Company Stockholder to be paid the
fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the
consideration specified in Section 2.4. The Company shall serve prompt notice
to Purchaser of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of
any such shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



 

18 (v) _Company Options and Warrants_. Subject to Section 3.8(c) below, all
rights to purchase any shares of the capital stock of the Company under the
terms of the Cavalier Telephone Corporation Third Amended and Restated
Incentive Plan (such plan, the " _Option Plan_ ", and any such rights, "
_Options_ "), whether vested or unvested, that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall terminate and be cancelled at
the Effective Time of the Merger in exchange for the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, in accordance with this Section
2.4(c)(v) the "net value" (as defined in the Plan), which could be zero, that
a holder of such Options would receive in connection with the Merger if such
holder had exercised his or her Options immediately prior to the Merger.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall elect
by resolution to take such actions reasonably necessary to effect the
treatment of the Options as described above. All warrants to purchase Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger ("
_Warrants_ ") shall be adjusted and cancelled as of immediately following the
Effective Time of the Merger in exchange for the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, in accordance with this Section 2.4(c)(v),
a lump sum cash payment (net of applicable taxes) in the amount, if any, equal
to the Per Common Share Merger Consideration less the purchase price per
share of such Warrant (which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, may equal
zero). In the event that the exercise price or purchase price per share with
respect to any share of the Companys common stock issuable under
a particular Option or Warrant, as the case may be, is equal to or greater
than the Per Common Share Merger Consideration, such Option or Warrant shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof, and shall thereupon have no further force or effect.

2.5 _Stock Certificates_. Each certificate that, before the Effective Time,
represented shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock will be, from and after
the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive
the applicable portion of the cash consideration, if any, as described in
Article III.

the Escrow Agent or from the Reserve Account for the benefit of the Company

Executive Officer of the Company (the " _CEO_ ") shall deliver to Purchaser a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries estimated as of
the Adjustment Time (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") together with
a schedule and worksheet (the " _Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation_
") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of the Base Merger
Consideration (the " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ "), including a
presentation of the calculations of the items comprising (i) Closing Working
Capital ascertained from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (as may be
adjusted as described in the following proviso, the " _Estimated Closing
Working Capital_ "), (ii) Net Company Indebtedness (which, for the avoidance

above will be, to the extent necessary, adjusted by the Company (and by
delivery of such adjustments by the CEO of the Company on the Closing Date
and prior to the Effective Time to reflect the good faith estimates of the
actual amounts on such date (for example, if the Estimated Net Company
Indebtedness was initially estimated as of the date immediately prior to the
actual Closing Date (because the parties anticipated Closing to occur on such
date) then such schedule and worksheet shall be updated to reflect any
additional Net Company Indebtedness). In connection with the foregoing, the
Company shall provide to Purchaser, within a reasonable period of time prior
to the preparation of such estimate, copies of, or access to, all books,
records, receipts and other information and documentation reasonably necessary
for Purchaser to understand how the Company computed the Estimated Merger
Consideration, including the Estimated Closing Working Capital, Estimated Net
Company Indebtedness, Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, Estimated
Company Closing Bonuses and Company Financing Costs. In accordance with
Section 3.2(b), if the amount of the Closing Working Capital reflected on the
Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation prepared pursuant to this Section
3.3 is less than the Target Working Capital Amount, then such shortfall shall
be deducted from the Estimated Merger Consideration, and if the Closing
Working Capital reflected on the Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation
prepared pursuant to this Section 3.3 is greater than the Target Working
Capital Amount, then such excess shall be added to the Estimated Merger
Consideration. The Company shall prepare the Estimated Merger Consideration
Calculation (including the determinations included therein) in accordance
with  _Annex A-3_.



 

21 (b) In connection with the delivery of the Estimated Merger Consideration
Calculation described in clause (a) above, the CEO shall deliver to
Purchaser, based upon the estimates described in such clause (a), a schedule
(the " _Merger Consideration Disbursement Schedule_ ") setting forth (which
schedule shall be updated at the Closing to the extent any such estimates
have been updated, and to the extent no update is necessary the CEO of the
Company shall provide written notice that the following items are accurate and
complete as of the Closing and such updated schedule or written notice shall
be ratified by the Stockholder Representative at such time):

(i) each Company Stockholders ownership of shares of Preferred Stock and
Common Stock (by series and class, as applicable) as of the Effective Time;

 

(ii) each holder of Options total holdings of Options (including the
applicable exercise price for such Options) as of the Effective Time;

(iii) each holder of Warrants total holding of Warrants (including the
applicable per share purchase price for such Warrants) as of the Effective
Time;

(iv) the applicable portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration, if any, to
be paid to each Company Securityholder pursuant to Article II (as adjusted by
this Article III);

 

(v) the amount of the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses set forth next to
the name of each Person receiving such portion of the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses;

(vi) the amount of the Company Closing Bonus to be paid to each recipient
thereof (assuming no failure of any of the conditions to each such recipients
receipt of a Company Closing Bonus prior to the Closing, which conditions are
set forth in the Sale Participation Program attached hereto as  _Annex B_ );

(vii) the Escrow Pro Rata Share of each of the Company Securityholders and
individuals listed on _Exhibit C_.

_provided_ , that, next to each Persons name on such Merger
Consideration Disbursement Schedule, the Company shall set forth detailed
wire instructions (or last known address) for each such Person who is not a
Business Employee. For purposes of illustration only, _Exhibit D_ hereto sets
forth an example of the Merger Consideration Disbursement Schedule,
calculated as if the Closing were occurring as of the date of this Agreement.

3.4 _ Deposit with Escrow Agent_. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, dated and
executed the date hereof and attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative have appointed
CSC Trust Corporation of Delaware as the escrow agent (in such capacity, the
" _Escrow Agent_ ") to hold the Escrow Amount. At the Closing,

 



 

22  Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The portion of the Escrow Amount
equal to the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be held in a segregated sub-
account solely for the payment of any post-closing adjustment in Purchasers
favor to the Estimated Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III and
as the exclusive source of any such payment, and shall be disbursed in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the
Escrow Amount equal to the Specified Matter Escrow Amount (if any) shall be
held in segregated sub-accounts with respect to each Specified Matter
Amount described on _Annex A-2_ and the amount deposited in each such sub-
account shall be held solely with respect to such Specified Matter and shall
be disbursed in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Annex A-2_ and
the Escrow Agreement.

3.5 _Company Indebtedness under Credit Facility_. On the Closing Date,
simultaneously with the Closing, Purchaser shall repay, or cause to be
repaid, for the account of the Company and its Subsidiaries, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, all Company Indebtedness then outstanding
under the Credit Facility, as directed by the Payoff Letter provided to
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date or any other Company Indebtedness which,
by its terms would be required to be paid by reason of, and at the time of,
the Effective Time as directed by the Company prior to the Closing. 

3.6 _Company Transaction Expenses and Company Closing Bonuses_. Simultaneously
with the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (a) all Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses for the account of each recipient thereof, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts provided by the Company and (b)
an amount equal to the sum of the Estimated Company Closing Bonuses, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Companys payroll account, for
further payment (net of applicable withholding Taxes) to each recipient
thereof.

3.7 _Reserve Account_. The Stockholder Representative may establish a reserve
account from the Estimated Merger Consideration (the " _Reserve Account_ ")
on account of the Company Securityholders in accordance with their Escrow Pro
Rata Shares in an aggregate amount determined by the Stockholder
Representative prior to the Closing in its sole discretion but not to exceed
$1,000,000 (the amount so established, the " _Reserve Amount_ ") to pay costs,
fees and expenses incurred by or for the benefit of the applicable Company
Securityholders on or after the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the written request of the Stockholder
Representative given to Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing, at the Closing Purchaser shall wire transfer the Reserve Amount to
an account designated by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of certain
Company Securityholders in accordance with their Escrow Pro Rata Shares. To
the extent amounts placed into the Reserve Account are not used, or in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative are not expected to be used, to pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement including costs associated with any post-Closing issues
or disputes, such remaining amount, together with all earnings thereon, shall
be distributed to the applicable Company Securityholders in proportion to
their respective Escrow Pro Rata Shares. The Stockholder Representative shall
have sole and exclusive authority to disburse and pay amounts placed into the
Reserve Account consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.



 

23 3.8 _Surrender and Payment to Company Securityholders_.

 

(a) _Deposit With Paying Agent_. The Company shall act as the paying agent (in
such capacity, the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Share
Certificates, Option Certificates and Warrant Certificates for the Base Merger
Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.4 and this Article
III, including the Merger Consideration Disbursement Schedule. Prior to the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Company Securityholders entitled to
payment of any of the Base Merger Consideration to which a Company
Securityholder thereof is entitled pursuant to the express terms of this
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds on behalf of all
Company Securityholders, an amount equal to the Estimated Merger Consideration
(as set forth in the Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation) _less_ the
_sum_ of (A) the Escrow Amount and (B) the Reserve Amount (such amount
required to be deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment of
the Base Merger Consideration and shall not be subject to any claim of
Purchaser, including claims under Section 3.9. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term obligations of the U.S.
government, (ii) certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company
having combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, (iii) short-term
money market instruments or (iv) such other investments as directed by joint
written notice of Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investment shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains unclaimed by the Company Securityholders as of the first anniversary
of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and the
Company Securityholders shall thereafter look, as general creditors thereof,
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the applicable portion of the
Base Merger Consideration with respect to their shares of capital stock of the
Company (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Reserve Amount or any
Additional Consideration paid to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to
Section 3.9(d), payment in respect of which, to the extent any Company
Securityholder is entitled, such Company Securityholder shall look solely to
the Stockholder Representative). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither the Stockholder Representative nor any other Party
shall be liable to a former holder of capital stock of the Company for any
cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable escheat
or abandoned property Laws.

(b) _Share Exchange Procedures_. At or after the Closing, each Company
Stockholder shall surrender to the Paying Agent the certificates evidencing
such Persons shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (the " _Share
Certificates_ ") for cancellation, together with a completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), upon which the Paying Agent shall pay from the
Payment Fund to the holder of each such Share Certificate, in exchange
therefor, the amount of cash in immediately available funds which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock or Common
Stock formerly represented by such Share Certificate pursuant to Section
2.4(c), as applicable, and the Share Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
relevant portion of the Base Merger Consideration may be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Share Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Share Certificate representing such shares shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the relevant portion of the Base Merger
Consideration 



 

24  to a Person other than the registered holder of such Share Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, may in its discretion and as a condition
to the issuance of the relevant portion of the Base Merger Consideration,
require the holder who is the owner of such unregistered shares of capital
stock to deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct against any
claim that may be made against Purchaser or Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to such shares. If any Share Certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder claiming such
Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed as provided in the Letter
of Transmittal, the Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser will issue in
consideration of the shares of Company Stock or Preferred Stock represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate the Base Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to the express
terms of this Agreement, _provided_ that, if required by the Surviving
Corporation or Purchaser and as a condition to the issuance of the relevant
portion of the Base Merger Consideration, such holder shall indemnify the
Surviving Corporation or Purchaser against any claim that may be made in
respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Share Certificate and shall, upon the request of Purchaser, deliver
a bond in such amount as may reasonably direct against any claim that may be
made against Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to such shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.8(b), each Share Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (or
at such other applicable time) such portion of the Base Merger Consideration
to which the holder of such Share Certificate is entitled pursuant and subject
to Article II and this Article III. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to the Company Securityholders on account of their Share
Certificates under Article II or this Article III.

(c) _Option and Warrant Exchange Procedures_. At or after the Closing, each
Company Optionholder and Company Warrantholder shall surrender to the Paying
Agent a copy of the agreement and/or instrument evidencing an Option (an "
_Option Certificate_ ") or Warrant (a " _Warrant Certificate_ "), together
with a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, upon which the Paying
Agent shall pay from the Payment Fund to the holder of such Option or Warrant,
in exchange therefor, the amount of cash in immediately available funds which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(v).

3.9 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

(a) No later than the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date,
Purchaser will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Adjustment Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Purchasers calculation of the
Base Merger Consideration and each of the components thereof, including a
reasonably detailed presentation of the items comprising Purchasers good
faith determinations of the Closing Working Capital (the " _Proposed Closing
Working Capital_ "), Net Company Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses,
Company Closing Bonuses and Company Financing Costs. Purchaser will prepare
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the
determinations included therein) in accordance with _Annex A-3_.



 

25 (b) During the forty-five (45)-day period immediately following
the Stockholder Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement or in the event Purchaser shall fail to deliver the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement within the ninety (90)-day period
described in Section 3.9(a) (in which case, at the Stockholder
Representatives option, the Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation
delivered in accordance with Section 3.3 will be treated as the Closing
Statement for all purposes hereof), the Stockholder Representative and its
representatives (i) will be permitted to review, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice, the Companys and the Purchasers books and
records and the working papers related to the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included
therein), and (ii) will be given access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to knowledgeable employees and accounting professionals of
Purchaser and the Company in order to facilitate the Stockholder
Representatives review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including
the determinations included therein) will become final, binding and
conclusive upon Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (a) on the 45th
day following the Stockholder Representatives receipt thereof, unless and
only to the extent that Purchaser receives from the Stockholder Representative
prior to such forty-fifth (45th) day written notice of the
Stockholder Representatives disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") with any
account or determination set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing
Statement or (b) on such earlier date as the Stockholder Representative
notifies Purchaser that it does not dispute the Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice will specify in reasonable detail the
nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted (collectively, the "
_Disputed Items_ "). If the Stockholder Representative timely delivers a
Dispute Notice, then the determination of the Base Merger Consideration (in
accordance with the resolution described in clause (x) or (y) below, as
applicable) will become final, binding and conclusive upon Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative on the first to occur of (x) the date on which
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y) the date on
which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative in writing are finally resolved in writing by the
Independent Accountants in accordance with Section 3.9(c).

(c) During the fifteen (15) days following delivery of a Dispute Notice,
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect to all of the
Disputed Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing by Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will be deemed final, binding and conclusive on
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative. If Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items during such
fifteen (15)-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree),
then at the end of such fifteen (15)-day (or longer) period Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will submit all unresolved Disputed Items
(collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to KPMG LLP (the " _Independent
Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such matters. Each of the Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative agrees to execute and deliver any engagement
letter reasonably required by the Independent Accountants. The Independent
Accountants will determine each Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not
be more favorable to Purchaser than the related amount reflected in the
Closing Statement nor more favorable to the Stockholder Representative than
the related amount set forth in the Dispute Notice) in accordance with _Annex
A-3_ as promptly as may be reasonably practicable, and Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will instruct the

 



 

26  Independent Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period
of no more than thirty (30) days. The Independent Accountants may conduct such
proceedings as the Independent Accountants believe, in their sole discretion,
will assist in the determination of the Unresolved Items; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative may
otherwise agree, all communications between Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand,
and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in writing with
copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. Provided that
the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation have made available to the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives in a timely manner all
information relating to the Proposed Closing Working Capital reasonably
requested, subject to Section 3.9(b), by the Stockholder Representative, then
the Independent Accountants shall make their determination solely on (x) the
documentation submitted by, and presentations (any such documentation or
presentation must be provided to the other party prior to its submission or
presentation to the Independent Accountants) made by the Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative, (y) the definitions of Closing Working Capital,
Company Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses, Company Closing Bonuses,
Proposed Closing Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Working Capital,
Estimated Net Company Indebtedness, Estimated Company Transaction Expenses,
Estimated Company Closing Bonuses, Company Financing Costs, Base Merger
Consideration, Estimated Merger Consideration, Additional Consideration and
Final Merger Consideration and (z) the accounting principles, policies,
procedures and methodologies reflected on _Annex A-3_ hereto. The
Independent Accountants determination of the Unresolved Items will be final,
binding and conclusive on Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, absent
manifest errors on all parties, and enforceable before a Governmental Body,
effective as of the date the Independent Accountants written determination
is received by Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative. Each of Purchaser
and the Stockholder Representative will bear its own legal, accounting and
other fees and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution
procedure. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred

aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items resolved by the Independent
Accountants in favor of the Purchaser and the denominator of which is the
aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution, shall be allocated to the Stockholder
Representative, and the remainder shall be allocated to the Purchaser (in
each case as finally determined by the Independent Accountants).

 

(d) Upon final determination of the adjustments to be made (if any) to the
Estimated Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.9(b) or (c) (as
applicable) (such amount, the " _Final Merger Consideration_ " and such date
of determination, the " _Final Determination Date_ "), an adjustment to the
Estimated Merger Consideration will be determined and paid as follows:

(i) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, the Stockholder Representative and Purchaser shall within
three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Merger Consideration
issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to
Purchaser the amount of such excess out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
Purchaser.



 

27 (ii) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Additional Consideration_ "),
Purchaser will (x) first, issue a joint written instruction (with the
Stockholder Representative) directing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Persons
set forth on Exhibit C to the Escrow Agreement all amounts held in the sub-
account for the Working Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 3 of

for deposit in the Payment Fund and distribution to the applicable Company
Securityholders, the amount of the Additional Consideration less the Working
Capital Escrow Amount. Any amount payable by Purchaser to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.9(d)(ii) will be paid within three (3) Business
Days of the determination of Final Merger Consideration by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
Stockholder Representative.

 

(iii) Any funds remaining in the sub-account in which the Working Capital
Escrow Amount is held following a distribution pursuant to the foregoing
Section 3.9(d)(i) shall be promptly paid to the Persons set forth on Exhibit C
to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with Section 3 of the Escrow Agreement,
and the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall issue joint
written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to make such payments.

to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.6. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of preparing the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, no
effect will be given to any new accounting pronouncements that may be issued
following delivery of the Estimated Merger Consideration Calculation.

hereof, relating to any transactions or commitments made, or any contracts or
agreements entered into, by either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and such Person, on the other hand.

 

4.27 _Route Information_. _Schedule 4.27_ sets forth detailed information
about the Companys fiber-based services and solutions from their high-
capacity fiber-based network (the " _Fiber Route_ ") including for each
segment, the number of fibers in each segment that the Company owns or to
which it has the right of use (whether by lease, indefeasible right of use or
some other mechanism), the route segment for such fiber, and in the case of
any fiber that is not owned by the Company, the name of any third party
provider. All such information regarding the Fiber Route furnished to the
Purchaser is true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this
Agreement. For any portion of the Fiber Route that is owned in fee by the
Company, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company has a valid and
enforceable easement or right of use with respect to the underlying real
property on which such portion of the Fiber Route is located. For any portion
of the Fiber Route to which the Company has rights as grantees under an
indefeasible right of use, to the Knowledge of the Company, the grantor of
such indefeasible right of use owns or has a valid and enforceable right of
use with respect to the underlying real property on which such portion of the
Fiber Route is located.

 



 

47 4.28 _Auction Process_. The Company and its Board of Directors, informed by
counsel and with advice received from outside legal and financial advisors,
have conducted a reasonably diligent exploration of the Companys strategic
alternatives, including a canvass of the marketplace for the Companys
securities and discussions with various potential acquirors of the Companys
securities, and the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded that the
Company and the Board of Directors have taken reasonable steps to achieve the
highest value for the Companys securities reasonably available under the
circumstances as the basis for agreeing to sell the Company to the Purchaser
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

4.29 _Accounts Receivable_. All of the outstanding accounts receivable of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (i) arose from bona fide transactions in the
Ordinary Course of Business; (ii) are in all material respects, subject to
disputes in the Ordinary Course of Business, valid, due and owing from third
parties; (iii) are collectible, in all material respects, subject to any
existing allowance for doubtful accounts; and (iv) are not, to the Knowledge
of the Company, subject to any prior assignment or Lien, or any defenses,
offsets or counterclaims, except those that arise in the Ordinary Course
of Business and Permitted Liens and the Liens securing the Credit Facility.
The reserves for doubtful accounts receivable and uncollectible amounts
reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet were established in accordance with
GAAP and, as of the date of this Agreement, are reasonably sufficient to
provide for any losses that may arise in connection with the collection of all
such accounts receivable.

 

4.30 _No Other Representations or Warranties; Schedules_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV (as modified by
the Disclosure Letter) and any other certificates delivered by the Company in
connection with this Agreement, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any
other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the Company disclaims any other representations or
warranties, whether made by the Company, any Company Securityholder or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV hereof (as modified by the Disclosure Letter), the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Company Securityholders hereby disclaim all liability
and responsibility for, or any use by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
representatives of, any representation, warranty, projection, forecast,
statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or
in writing) to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives (including any
opinion, information, projection or advice that may heretofore have been or
may hereafter be made available to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
representatives, whether in any "data rooms," "management presentations," or
"break out sessions", in response to questions submitted by or on behalf of
Purchaser or otherwise by any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant,
or representative of the Company or the Company Securityholders or any of
their respective Affiliates).

and assigns with respect to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by

decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to: (i) authorize the release or delivery to Purchaser of all or any
portion of the Escrow Amount whether with respect to the payment (if any) to
Purchaser or the Company Securityholders resulting from the post-Closing

accomplishment of the foregoing and any other post-Closing matters. As, and by
voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue of the
approval of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any
Person, the Stockholder Representative shall have authority and power to act
on behalf of the Company Securityholders with respect to the disposition,
settlement or other handling of the adjustments contemplated by Section 3.9
and all rights or obligations arising under Section 3.9, and the Company
Securityholders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by
the Stockholder Representative in connection with Section 3.9, and Purchaser
shall be entitled to rely on any action, decision, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative, including as being an act, decision, consent
or instruction of any Company Securityholder. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative may act upon any
instrument or other writing believed by the Stockholder Representative to be
genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person and shall not be
liable in connection with the performance by it of its duties pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder
Representative. As, and by voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger
and/or by virtue of the approval of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of any Person, the Company Securityholders shall be deemed to
have agreed that the Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified and held
harmless (out of funds that otherwise are to be distributed from the Escrow
Amount to the Company Securityholders, if any, as described in the
following sentence) from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or 



 

49  administration of its duties hereunder. As, and by voting in favor of or
consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue of the approval of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of any Person, the Company
Securityholders shall be deemed to have agreed that any out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
actions taken by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms
of Section 3.9 (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of
legal fees and costs) (" _Representative Expenses_ ") shall be the
responsibility of the Company Securityholders based on their Escrow Pro Rata
Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
as, and by voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue of
the approval of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any
Person, the Company Securityholders agree that if (i) the Stockholder
Representative determines that the Reserve Amount and earnings thereon is not
sufficient to pay actual or anticipated Representative Expenses, and (ii) such
Company Securityholders representing Escrow Pro Rata Shares of at least 64%
in the aggregate have agreed in writing to contribute an additional aggregate
amount to the Reserve Account as proposed by the Stockholder Representative in
writing to all Persons listed on  _Exhibit C_ hereto, then each such Company
Securityholder shall be obligated, within ten (10) days after written notice
from the Stockholder Representative, to contribute to the Reserve Account such
Company Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Share of the additional aggregate
amount of such additional Reserve Amount. As, and by voting in favor of or
consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue of the approval of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of any Person, the Company
Securityholders shall be deemed to have agreed that upon final distribution of
the Escrow Amount, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholder
Representative, out of the aggregate Escrow Amount that otherwise are to be
distributed to the Company Securityholders, if any, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, any unpaid Representative Expenses,
and the Stockholder Representative may withhold a disproportionate amount from
any Company Securityholder(s) that were the cause of any Representative
Expenses, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative shall have full power and authority to interpret
all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof, on behalf of all the Company
Securityholders and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

 

(b) As, and by voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger and/or by virtue
of the approval of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
any Person, the Company Securityholders shall be deemed to have appointed and
constituted the Stockholder Representative the true and lawful attorney-in-
fact of the Company Securityholders, with full power in their name and
on their behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement in the absolute discretion of the Stockholder Representative;
and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including, without
limitation, executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other
agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments
contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement.
This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and
shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Company
Securityholder, by operation of law, whether by such persons death,
disability, protective supervision or any other event. Without limiting
the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a
special obligation and, accordingly, by approval of the Merger, each Company
Securityholder shall be deemed to have waived and renounced its, his or her
right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally any time before the day
following the Release Date. As, and by voting in favor of or consenting to

  

 

50  the Merger and/or by virtue of the approval of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of any Person, the Company Securityholders shall be
deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative taken under
the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted in this
Article V, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document
shall be ineffective solely by reason of a Company Securityholder (instead of
the Stockholder Representative) having signed or given the same directly.

 

(c) Company Stockholders who in the aggregate hold at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the Company Stockholders interest in the Escrow Amount
shall have the right at any time prior to the date that the funds deposited
with the Escrow Agent are distributed in accordance with Section 3.9(d) to
remove the then-acting Stockholder Representative and to appoint a successor
Stockholder Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither such removal
of a then acting Stockholder Representative nor such appointment of a
successor Stockholder Representative shall be effective until (x) notice
of such act has been provided to Purchaser, (y) the delivery to the Escrow
Agent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by each such Company
Stockholder constituting a majority of interests with respect to such removal
and (z) appointment, together with an acknowledgment signed by the successor
Stockholder Representative appointed in such writing that it, he or she
accepts the responsibility of successor Stockholder Representative and agrees
to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable
to the Stockholder Representative, with a copy of such acknowledgment being
promptly provided to Purchaser. Each successor Stockholder Representative
shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by
this Agreement upon the original Stockholder Representative, and the term
"Stockholder Representative" as used herein and in the Agency Agreement shall
be deemed to include any interim or successor Stockholder Representative.

(d) It is understood and agreed by each of the parties hereto that nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed or deemed to expand or create any right on
the part of a Company Securityholder, with respect to Purchaser or any of its
affiliates, or any obligation on the part of Purchaser, or any of its
Affiliates, to any Company Securityholder not otherwise expressly set forth
in clear and unambiguous terms in this Agreement (to the extent that there may
be any such provisions herein).

 

(e) Each Company Securityholder, as and by the approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders (as evidenced by the Written Consent) and/or by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any Person, is
deemed to have agreed to release and discharge Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective Affiliates from and against any
liability arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder
Representatives failure to distribute any amounts received by the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of such Company Securityholders and each of
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, each of their respective Affiliates and
the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts
or omissions done or taken by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. 

(f) The Stockholder Representative hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser
that (i) the it has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this



 

51  Agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder, (ii) this
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Stockholder
Representative and (iii) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement enforceable against such Stockholder Representative in accordance
with its terms.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
shall act on its own behalf at all times prior to the Effective Time, shall
sign on its own behalf and shall not appoint any Person as its lawful
attorney-in-fact.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (i) the
Stockholder Representative shall not make any elections or decisions or take
any other actions that would reasonably be expected to have a
disproportionately adverse effect on any individual Company Securityholder as
compared to other Company Securityholders holding the same class or series of
capital stock of the Company, except to the extent such disproportionate
treatment results directly from a post-Closing matter involving such Company
Securityholder and (ii) without the written consent of any Company
Securityholder, the Stockholder Representative shall not have any authority to
increase the post-Closing liability of such Company Securityholder with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement beyond its
Escrow Pro Rata of the Escrow Amount and the Reserve Amount (as increased, if
at all, in accordance with Article V).

performance by it of this Agreement and each Purchaser Document have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of Purchaser.
This Agreement has been, and each Purchaser Document will be at or prior to
the Closing, duly executed and delivered by it and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto)

Debt Commitment Letter, together with all amendments, schedules and exhibits
thereto, pursuant to which the Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser
debt financing in the amount set forth therein (such debt financing described
therein, the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy and completeness of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Article IV and
performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements in this Agreement,
the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing, together with
Purchasers Cash on hand, will be sufficient for Purchaser to make all
necessary payments by it in connection with the consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses. In the event the Debt Commitment Letter is superseded after the date

the only representations and warranties that Purchaser relied on in making
its decision to enter into this Agreement and acquire the Company pursuant to
the Merger.

proceeding by or before any Governmental Body or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser or Merger Sub, threatened against Purchaser or Merger Sub before any
Governmental Body, U.S. or foreign which, if adversely determined, would have
a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS

7.1  _Access to Information_. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be
entitled, through its officers, employees and representatives (including,
without limitation, its legal and financial advisors, Financing Sources and
accountants), to make such investigation of the properties, employees,
businesses and operations of the Company and such examination of the books and

that the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to
allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so would not (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with counsel)) be likely

reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be lost with respect to such
information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior
to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (i)

respect to, all material information relating to it and its Subsidiaries that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Body (including those required under the HSR Act and the Communications Laws)
that are required in order to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section

7.4 _Regulatory Approvals_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
Section 7.3:

practicable and, in any event, within ten (10) business days after the date
of this Agreement in the case of all filings required under the HSR Act, (ii)
comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ") for additional information,
documents, or other materials received by each of them or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Body in respect of such
filings or such transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in
connection with any such filing (including, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing
parties

 



 

60  prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division
or other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. Each such party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental
Body regarding any such filings or any such transaction.

(b) each of Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement and to, (ii) avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall
be required to pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (except each party shall be responsible for payment of its own
attorneys fees) with respect to any inquiries or issues that arise in
connection with the filings contemplated by this Section 7.4.

 

(c) _FCC and State PUCs_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable and in any event, within 10 Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, the parties shall prepare and file all necessary
applications, notifications and related filings for obtaining the Required
Consents from the FCC and State PUCs. Each party shall promptly provide the
other party with all information necessary for the preparation of such
applications, notifications and filings on a timely basis, including those
portions of such applications, notifications and filings which are required to
be completed by each party, counsel to the Purchaser shall prepare
the initial draft of the applications, notifications and any other filings;
and

(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute the FCC and
State PUC applications in good faith and with due diligence before the FCC and
the State PUCs and in connection therewith, take such actions as may be
necessary or reasonably required in connection with the applications,
including the furnishing to the FCC and the State PUCs any documents,
materials, or other information requested by the FCC and the State PUCs in
order to obtain the Required Consents as expeditiously as reasonably
practicable. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (A) promptly notify the other
parties of any material communication to that party from the FCC, any State
PUC or any other Person with respect to the FCC or the State PUC applications,
as applicable; (B) permit a representative of the other party to attend and
participate in substantive meetings (telephonic or otherwise) with the FCC or
any State PUC; and (C) permit the other party to review in advance, as
reasonable, any proposed material written communication to the

 



 

61  FCC or any State PUC. No party shall, without the written consent of the
other party, take, or fail to take, any action if the intent or reasonably
anticipated consequence of such action or failure to act is, or would be, to
cause or materially increase the probability of the FCC or any State PUC not
to grant approval of any FCC application or of any State PUC application or
materially delay any such approval, to the material detriment of the other
parties. If there are any petitions for reconsideration, appeals or similar
filings made seeking to overturn the grant of the FCC Approval or grant of any
of the State PUC Consents, or if the FCC or a State PUC seeks to reconsider
such grant on its own motion, then the parties shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to defend the applicable grants against such actions. Each
party shall be responsible for payment of its own attorneys fees and related
costs and expenses associated with obtaining any such State PUC Consents and
FCC Consents.

7.5 _Further Assurances_. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall (i) execute
and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents and
other instruments and shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all such further
actions as may be reasonably required, necessary or appropriate to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) not in limitation of any other provision
of this Agreement, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including without limitation the condition set
forth in Section 8.1(g)); (iii) prior to the Closing, cooperate in good faith
in connection with meetings and communications with customers, suppliers,
distribution channels and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
(iv) cooperate in good faith prior to and at the Closing to facilitate an
orderly Closing and transition consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

 

7.6 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to
it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Purchaser and
the Company dated May 5, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall not
restrict the disclosure to other Persons of any such information to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby and required to consummate the Merger and the
Debt Financing provided that, unless any provision of this Agreement
(including Sections 7.8 and 7.13) contemplates public disclosure or other
unrestricted disclosure of such information, the recipients of
such information comply with the obligations set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 

7.7 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or
prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers or employees of the Company
(collectively, the " _D andO __Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the
Company or any Subsidiary at any time prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser
agrees that all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or



 

62  omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of the Company as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the DandO Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay any
reasonable expenses of any DandO Indemnitee under this Section 7.7, as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, _provided_ that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause (i) the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the DandO Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors,
officers, employees and agents and indemnification than are set forth as of
the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Company and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to retain
the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors, officers,
employees and agents, which provisions in each case shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnitees.

(c) Each of Purchaser and DandO Indemnitee shall cooperate, and cause
their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 7.7 and each such party shall provide the other access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to purchase and fully pay for a "tail" policy of officers and
directors liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time covering each past and present officer and
director of the Company who are currently covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy (a true and complete copy of which
has been made available to Purchaser). To the extent not otherwise paid in
full prior to the Closing Date, the cost of tail policy that is purchased
shall be included as a Company Transaction Expense. To the extent commercially
reasonable, such tail policy shall be for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time and Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain and pay for such policys premiums during such six (6) year
period. To the extent commercially reasonable, the terms and coverage amounts
of the liability insurance policy shall be at least as favorable as the terms
and coverage amounts of the liability insurance policy in effect on the date
hereof.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.7: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by Contract or otherwise (it being expressly agreed
that the DandO Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.7.

 



 

63 7.8 _Public Announcements_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, except to the extent required by Law (in each case, in the judgment of
the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be), neither the Company nor
Purchaser shall issue, or cause to be issued, any press release or public
announcement of any kind concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
without the consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and in the event any such
press release, public announcement or other disclosure is required by Law or
the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ stock market or the London Stock
Exchanges AIM market rules, the parties will consult prior to the making
thereof and use their best efforts to agree upon a mutually satisfactory
text. None of the foregoing shall adversely affect or limit the Purchasers
ability to comply with its obligations as a public company.

 

7.9 _Employment Matters_. The Purchaser shall provide, or cause an Affiliate
to provide, for a twelve (12)-month period immediately following the Closing
Date, to all continuing Business Employees (for so long as such Business
Employees continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation), base salary
levels, annual bonus opportunities and employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements which, as to each Business Employee, are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the base salary levels, annual bonus opportunities and
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements provided or made available
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser.

7.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Proration of Certain Company Taxes_. All Taxes payable by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, including income, real estate, personal property and
any special Taxes or assessments attributable to the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, for the fiscal year during which the Closing occurs
that are by their nature attributable to the entire Tax period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, shall be allocated proportionately to
the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of
such year or other period after the Closing Date. In making the
foregoing allocation, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income
or receipts shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date ( _provided_ that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be apportioned between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period), and the amount
of other Taxes for the portion of any such period ending on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such period. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any such Taxes allocated to the period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") shall be included on the Closing
Balance Sheet as a current liability to the extent such Taxes remain unpaid as
of the Closing Date, and to the extent so included the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall pay the same when and as due. Any such Taxes allocated to
the period after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Period_ ") shall be
included

 



 

64  in the Companys current assets on the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent
such Taxes have been paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or before the
Closing Date. No such Taxes allocated to the Post-Closing Period shall be
included on the Closing Balance Sheet as a liability. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the prorations set forth herein shall be made in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the Company. 

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice and file or cause to be filed on a timely basis all Tax
Returns for taxable periods that are required to be filed on or before the
Closing Date. The Company shall timely pay all Tax liabilities reflected on
such Tax Returns and shall timely and fully pay all Taxes (including
installments of estimated Taxes) that are due on or before the Closing Date.
The Company shall make available to Purchaser: (i) no less than 10 days prior
to the applicable filing date, copies of the following draft Tax Returns: (A)
net income, alternative or add-on minimum, capital and franchise Tax Returns
that are due after September 23, 2010, and (B) property Tax Returns due
after September 23, 2010, and the Company shall make any reasonable changes
to any such Tax Returns so long as they are received from the Purchaser no
later than five (5) days prior to the filing due date for such Tax Return, and
(ii) no later than the seventh Business Day of each month, copies of the
following draft Tax Returns with respect to the immediately preceding month:
(x) gross receipts, sales, use, excise and occupation Tax Returns due after
October 1, 2010; (y) withholding, payroll, employment, social security and
unemployment Tax Returns due after October 1, 2010; and (z) telecommunications
Relay Service, North America Numbering Plan Administration and Local Number
Portability Support returns due after October 1, 2010, and the Company shall
make any reasonable changes to any such Tax Returns so long as they are
received from the Purchaser no later than three (3) days prior to the filing
due date for such Tax Return. 

(ii) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and file or shall cause to
be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date that relate to any Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date or to any Tax period which includes, but does not end on, the
Closing Date (" _Straddle Tax Returns_ "). Purchaser shall cause each such
Tax Return to be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companys past
practices and procedures, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.
Purchaser shall timely pay all Tax liabilities reflected on Straddle Tax
Returns. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing of any such
income Tax Return, Purchaser shall permit the Stockholder Representative to
review and comment on such Tax Return (or, in the case of a Tax Return that
reports items of income or deduction of other entities in addition to the
Company, the portion of such Tax Return that relates exclusively to the
Company) and shall consider in good faith any revisions to such Tax Return as
the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably request.

(c) _Cooperation and Controversies_. Following the Closing, Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Stockholders and the Stockholder Representative shall,
as reasonably requested by any party hereto: (i) assist any other party in
preparing any Tax Returns relating to 



 

65  the Company which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing;
(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax audit of, or dispute with Taxing
Authorities regarding, and any judicial or administrative proceeding relating

investigation of claims, and in connection with the preparation of financial
statements or other documents to be filed with any Taxing Authority, in each
case, with respect to the Company; (iii) make available to the other parties
hereto and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably requested all information,
records, and documents relating to Taxes relating to the Company (at the cost
and expenses of the requesting party); (iv) provide timely notice to the other
parties hereto in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments relating to the Company for taxable periods for which any such
other party is responsible; and (v) furnish the other parties hereto with
copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in connection
with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any Tax periods for
which any such other party is responsible.

7.11 _Company Stockholder Approval; Notice_.

accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the Companys bylaws,
solicit written consents to obtain the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by required vote of the Company Stockholders. The Company shall
ensure that written consents are solicited from its stockholders, in
compliance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the Companys bylaws,

including Sections 228, 251 and 262 thereof, and otherwise satisfy and
comply with the Companys obligations and duties under Delaware Law (such
document, the " _Information Statement_ "), in each case, with such
information as shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and content to
Purchaser.

 

7.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the Closing, as applicable, the
Company shall not and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the
Majority Stockholder (as defined in the Securityholders Agreement)) and its
and their representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (except with
respect to Purchaser and its Affiliates) (i) solicit or invite any inquiries,
proposals or indications of interest, or enter into any discussions,
negotiations, understandings, arrangements or contracts relating to the direct
or indirect disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of



 

66  all or any material portion of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or assets or (ii) knowingly disclose to any Person
any confidential information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or assets in connection with such
a transaction (as described in clause (i)).

applicable, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
representatives to, cease and terminate immediately any existing discussions
or negotiations with respect to or in furtherance of any transaction described
in clause (a) above. The Company shall request that all third parties who

connection with the consideration of a possible acquisition, return to the
Company, or destroy, all confidential information heretofore furnished to
such third parties by or on behalf of the Company, as promptly as practicable,
subject to the terms of such agreements.

 

7.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
Debt Financing (including a Debt Securities Financing or any alternative debt
financing arrangements) at or prior to the Closing. In the event any portion
of the Debt Financing become unavailable, Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative
sources of third party debt financing on terms reasonably deemed by Purchaser
to be no less favorable to the Surviving Corporation in the aggregate than the
terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of Purchaser and Merger
Sub acknowledge that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to
Purchaser and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (but absence of such condition shall not undermine the
covenants and obligations of the Company included herein).

(b) At Purchasers request, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its officers,
employees, directors and representatives to, cooperate reasonably with the
Purchaser and the _Financing Sources_ in consummating the Debt Financing,
including providing documents and information required to be provided by the
Company pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and other reasonably necessary
documents and information and access to personnel and other assistance and
cooperation. Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable efforts to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing,

diligence, (ii) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources, for public
disclosure, as required, with the Required Financial Statements and with such
other financial and other pertinent information as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser or the Financing Sources to consummate the Debt Financing,
including all Company financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (including any audited financial
statements, but only to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter in
existence on the date hereof and provided to the Company) and the financial
information regarding the Company on a stand-alone basis included in financing
transactions of a similar nature that would allow

 



 

67  Purchaser to comply with the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing
contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
(but no covenant is being made by the Company with respect to the information
including financial information of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries), (iii)
providing reasonable assistance to Purchaser and the Financing Sources in the
preparation of and participation in (A) both a private and public offering
document for any portion of the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating
agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts
for any portion of the Debt Financing including as contemplated by paragraph
7 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter and (v) using reasonable efforts
to cause its independent accountants to provide assistance and cooperation in
the Debt Financing, including (A) participating in a reasonable number
of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions, (B) providing any
necessary consents to use their audit reports, and (C) providing customary
"comfort letters." Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs reasonably
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives in connection with assistance and cooperation under this
Section 7.13. For purposes of this Section 7.13(b), references to "Debt
Financing" include a Debt Securities Financing or any alternative debt
financing arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any
provisions set forth in this Agreement the Company shall not be obligated to
provide information or take actions with respect to any alternative debt
financing arrangements that would be more burdensome to the Company in the
aggregate in any material respect than would be the case with respect to a
financing under the Debt Commitment Letter that is in existence on the date
hereof and provided to the Company. The Company shall, following the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time,
provide Purchaser with copies of all material financial reports which are
provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in the Ordinary Course of
Business, which such materials, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
at the last day of such month which the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to the Purchaser by the twentieth calendar day
of the following month, and shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or representatives shall have any responsibility for, or incur
any liability to any Person under or in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or any alternative financing that the Purchaser or Merger
Sub may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that Purchaser and Merger Sub shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, shareholders, employees
and representatives from and against any and all losses, expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses), costs and other liabilities suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

 

7.14 _Notification_.

 

(a) _By the Company_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall as soon as practicable disclose to Purchaser in writing (in the form of
updated Disclosure Letter, which updated Disclosure Letter shall reasonably
clearly mark any additions or deletions to such Disclosure Letter) its
knowledge of any material failures to be true of, or material breaches of,
the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and of any other
fact or event that would, if not cured, cause or constitute a material breach
of the covenants in

 



 

68  this Agreement made by the Company, in each case to the extent that such
failure or breach would entitle the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement
under Section 9.1(d). Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the delivery of any notice to the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.14 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to any party
hereto. No disclosure pursuant to this Section 7.14 shall be deemed to
constitute an amendment to the Disclosure Letter for any purpose or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by the Company.

 

(b) _By the Purchaser._ From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall as soon as practicable disclose to the Company in writing (in
the form of updated Disclosure Letter, which updated Disclosure Letter shall
reasonably clearly mark any additions or deletions to such Disclosure Letter)
its knowledge of any material failures to be true of, or material breaches
of, the representations and warranties contained in Article VI and of any
other fact or event that would, if not cured, cause or constitute a material
breach of the covenants in this Agreement made by the Purchaser, in each case
to the extent that such failure or breach would entitle the Company to
terminate this Agreement under Section 9.1(e). Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, the delivery of any notice to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 7.14 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available to any party hereto. No disclosure pursuant to this Section
7.14 shall be deemed to constitute an amendment to the Disclosure Letter for
any purpose or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant by the Purchaser.

"Purchaser Response") of its knowledge, as of the date of the Purchaser
Response, of any material breaches of the Companys obligations and the
agreements required by this Agreement that Purchaser reasonably believes would
form the basis for Purchasers assertion that the condition set forth in
Section 8.1(b) has not been satisfied were the Closing to occur on such date
or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of the
Written Demand, and, if the Company elects to deliver a Written Demand, an
officer of the Purchaser shall timely deliver a Purchaser Response and certify

Demand; provided that, the foregoing shall not (i) relieve or otherwise

any matter, event or circumstance of which Purchaser had knowledge on or prior
to the delivery of the Purchaser Response), or (iii) be deemed to cure, or
limit Purchasers remedies with respect to, any breaches or alleged breaches
by the Company identified in the Purchaser Response; provided that it is
understood and agreed that the purpose of this Section 9.2 is to provide the
Company with the opportunity to cure any breaches of covenants, as

terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, then each of the parties shall be

relieve any party hereto from liability for any breach of this Agreement and,

operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any

11.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially

originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except as contemplated by Section 7.7 and, with respect
to the Financing Sources, who shall be third party beneficiaries to Section
11.4(d). No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by either the Company or Purchaser, directly or
indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void. No assignment of any obligations hereunder
shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 

11.10 _Retention of Counsel_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right, at its election, to retain Edwards Angell
Palmer and Dodge LLP (the " _Law Firm_ ") to represent it in such matter.
Purchaser, for itself and the Company and for their respective successors and
assigns, hereby waives and consents to any such representation in any such
matter and Purchaser, for itself and the Company and for their respective
successors and assigns, hereby agrees that the Stockholder
Representative may, prior to the Closing, obtain a copy of written
communications



 

77  between the Law Firm and the Company made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery or Closing under, or any dispute
or proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement between
Purchaser and the Company (for evidentiary purposes in the event of a dispute
between Purchaser, on the one hand and the Stockholder Representative, on the
other hand, or between the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, and
any Company Stockholder, on the other hand). In connection with its
representation of the Stockholder Representative and/or certain of the Company
Securityholders in matters pertaining to the transactions contemplated herein,
the Law Firm may disclose to the Stockholder Representative, the parties to
the Written Consent and to those Persons who are, prior to the Effective Time,
officers of the Company actively involved in the review and preparation of the
documents relating to the transactions contemplated herein, any information
learned by the Law Firm in the course of its representation of the Company,
whether or not such information is subject to the attorney-client privilege
and/or the Law Firms duty of confidentiality, and whether or not such
disclosure is made before or after the Closing. Each of Purchaser, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably waives any right it may have to
discover, obtain or use in evidence any information or documentation relating
to the representation by the Law Firm of the Company in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided however that such waiver
shall not apply with respect to the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation (i)
defending against, or exercising subrogation, contribution or similar rights
with respect to, any derivative actions initiated by Company Securityholders
or (ii) prosecuting or defending claims by or against other third parties in
which the interests of the Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation could
not be reasonably expected to be or become adverse to the interests of the
Stockholder Representative and/or the Company Securityholders.

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.
