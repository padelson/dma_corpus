Section 4.05 Sufficiency of Funds.  Buyer has provided to Seller a correct and complete copy  of an executed commitment letter dated February 7, 2020 (the &#8220;Debt Commitment Letter&#8221;) from the  lenders party thereto (collectively, the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;) relating to the commitment of the Lenders to provide  debt financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the &#8220;Debt Financing&#8221;).  Except as set forth in  the  Debt  Commitment  Letter,  there  are  no  conditions  precedent  to  the  obligations  of  the  Lenders  to  provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount  of the Debt Financing.  As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is valid, binding and in full  force and effect, enforceable in accordance with its terms against Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer,  each  of  the  other  parties  thereto,  subject  to  the  effect  of  any  applicable  Laws  relating  to  bankruptcy,  reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws  relating to or affecting creditors&#8217; rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general  principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or  at law).  As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, altered or modified  (and no such amendment, alteration or modification is contemplated) and (ii) the commitments set forth in  the  Debt  Commitment  Letter  have  not  been  withdrawn  or  rescinded  in  any  respect  (and  no  such  withdrawal  or  rescission  is  contemplated).

As  of  the  date  hereof,  assuming  the  accuracy  of  the  representations and warranties in Article III, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of  time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a material default or material breach or a failure  to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or, to the knowledge of Buyer,  any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter, under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment  Letter other than any such default, breach or failure that has been waived by the Lenders, or otherwise  cured in a timely manner by Buyer or its  Affiliates to the  satisfaction of the  Lenders.  As  of the  date  hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III and assuming the Seller  complies  with  and  performs  in  all  material  respects  all  of  its  agreements  and  covenants  under  this  Agreement, Buyer (i) has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term  or condition of closing to be satisfied by it or its Affiliates contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and  (ii)  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  any  portion  of  the  Debt  Financing  required  to  consummate  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be made available to Buyer on the Closing Date,  including any reason to believe that any of the Lenders will not perform their funding obligations under  the  Debt  Commitment  Letter  in  accordance  with  its  terms  and  conditions.   As  of  the  date  of  this  Agreement, Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant  to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement.  The proceeds from  the Debt Financing (when consummated in accordance and terms of the Debt Commitment Letter), after  netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges provided  under the Debt Commitment Letter, will be sufficient when funded, together with other sources of funds  that  will  be  immediately  available  to  Buyer,  for  Buyer,  if  the  Closing  occurs,  to  (x)  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  to  be  consummated  on  the  Closing  Date  on  the  terms  contemplated by the Transaction Documents (including without limitation the payment of the Purchase                                          34 </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the incurrence by any member of the Company Group of any expense that  would be deemed a Transaction Expense shall not be deemed, solely by reason thereof, to be a breach of  this Section 5.01 to the extent such expense is included in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price as  finally determined in accordance with Section 2.04.  Nothing in this Section 5.01 shall require Seller to  obtain  Buyer&#8217;s  consent  or  approval  with  respect  to  the  pricing  of  Seller&#8217;s  services,  the  offer  and/or  rejection of contractual relationships with Seller&#8217;s customers and prospective customers, the procurement  of supplies, personnel and resources, in each case of the foregoing, in the Ordinary Course of Business,  and  all  modifications  to  the  foregoing  that  taken  together  do  not  represent  a  material  change  in the  Company Group&#8217;s business practices, it being the intent of the parties that until the Closing, Seller and  Buyer will continue to operate as separate businesses at arm&#8217;s length from each other, continue to make  independent decisions and continue to have the right and ability to fully compete with each other in any  and  all  business  activities. From  the  date  hereof  until  the  Closing,  Seller  shall  keep  Buyer  reasonably  informed on a timely basis and, in each case, prior to taking any material action with respect to, each of  the matters set forth on Section 5.01 of the Disclosure Schedules.

Further, Buyer and its Representatives shall not conduct  any testing of soil, groundwater, building materials, equipment or other component of the environment or  the  assets  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Seller  and  subject  to  such  conditions  as  Seller  may  reasonably  require  in  its  sole  discretion.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  neither Seller nor any member of the Company Group shall be required to disclose any information to  Buyer if such disclosure would, in Seller&#8217;s reasonable discretion: (w) cause significant competitive harm  to  Seller,  any  member  of  the  Company  Group  and  their  respective  businesses  if  the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated; (x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal  privilege; (y) disclose confidential employment records, including medical and other information covered  by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; or (z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or  binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, any  severance  benefits  due  and  payable  under  any  Retention  Incentive  Agreement  (as  defined  in  the  Disclosure  Schedules) following  Closing shall  be  the  sole responsibility  of  Buyer  and  its  Affiliates  (including the members of the Company Group).

Section 5.08 Confidentiality. Each  party  hereto  covenants  and  agrees  that,  following  the  Closing, it shall, and  shall cause its  Affiliates to, keep confidential and not disclose  to any Person,  or  otherwise use for any purpose, except in connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing (subject to  customary  confidentiality  arrangements) or  as  may  otherwise  be  contemplated  in  this  Agreement,  any  Confidential Information of the other party hereto or such other party&#8217;s Affiliates (for the avoidance of  doubt, the members of the Company Group will be Affiliates of Buyer following the Closing).

(d)   Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.09 will give rise  to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy, and hereby  agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer shall,  in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach,  be  entitled  to  seek  equitable  relief,  including  a  temporary  restraining  order,  an  injunction,  specific  performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction, without  having to post bond.

In the event  that  any  covenant  contained  in  this Section  5.09 should  ever  be  adjudicated  to  exceed  the  time,  geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then  any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,  in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted  by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 5.09 and each provision hereof are severable  and  distinct  covenants  and  provisions.  The  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of  any  such  covenant  or  provision  as  written  shall not invalidate  or  render  unenforceable  the  remaining  covenants  or  provision  hereof,  and  any  such  invalidity  or  unenforceability  in  any  jurisdiction  shall  not  invalidate  or  render  unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction. No breach of any provision of this  Agreement shall operate to extinguish Seller&#8217;s obligation to comply with this Section 5.09.         (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 5.09 shall not apply to any third  party or its Affiliates (other than Seller and the entities (or successors thereof) which were Affiliates of  Seller immediately prior to the acquisition by such third party as contemplated below) which (i) acquires  a  majority equity interest in Seller or in any Affiliate  of Seller, or (ii) acquires  all or a  portion of the  business or assets of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, regardless of the form of such transaction.

Each party hereto shall cooperate fully with  the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders  and approvals.

Buyer and its Affiliates shall execute any powers of attorney reasonably  requested by Seller on behalf of the Company Group in order for the Representatives selected by Seller to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  preceding  sentence.  All  such  Tax  Returns  prepared  or  caused  to  be  prepared by Seller (including amendments thereto) shall be prepared consistent with the past practice of  the Company Group, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller shall ensure that such Tax  Returns are timely filed and that any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns are paid at the time of  filing. The Company Group&#8217;s final Tax period ending prior to the Closing Date shall end on the close of  business on the Closing Date in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1)  (and  similar  provisions  under  state  law  to  the  extent  available  for  all  income  Tax  purposes).

Buyer shall cause each member of the Company Group to furnish information to  Seller as reasonably requested by Seller to allow Seller to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.12 in  accordance with past custom and practice. Buyer hereby irrevocably designates, and agrees to cause each  of its Affiliates to so designate, Seller as its agent to take any and all actions necessary or incidental to the  preparation and filing of any such Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared and will timely  file or cause to be timely filed all other Tax Returns required in respect of the Company Group, including  any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, but excluding any Tax Return with respect to periods for which the  consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Returns of Seller will include the operations of any member of the  Company  Group. Any such Tax Returns (including amendments  thereto) that include  Pre-Closing Tax  Periods will, unless Seller otherwise consents in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned  or  delayed),  be  prepared  on  a  basis  consistent  with  the  elections,  accounting  methods,  conventions and principles of taxation used for the most recent taxable periods for which Tax Returns  involving similar matters have been filed. The party responsible for the preparation of a particular income  or gross receipts Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a portion of a Straddle Period) shall  make available a draft of such Tax Return (or relevant portions thereof) a reasonable time before the date  the filing is required (and no fewer than twenty Business Days), for review and comment by such non- responsible  party  (but,  if  due  within  thirty  Business  Days  after  Closing,  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable). With respect to any income or gross receipts Tax Return for a Straddle Period, Buyer shall  prepare  (or cause  to be  prepared) such Tax  Return  and  shall  deliver  such Tax  Return to  Seller for its  review at least 45 days (and no fewer than twenty Business Days) prior to the date such Tax Return is  required to  be  filed  (but,  if  due  within  thirty  Business  Days  after  Closing,  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable). If Seller disputes any item on such income or gross receipts Tax Return, it shall notify Buyer  of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection within 10 days of its receipt of such Tax  Return.  Nothing  in  this Section  5.12 shall  obligate  Seller  or  its  Affiliates  to  provide  any  Tax  Return  information relating to any consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of which Seller or its Affiliates  is a member, other than solely with respect to the Company Group.         (b)   Seller shall be responsible for any Pre-Closing Taxes due in respect of any Tax Return  required to be filed before, on or after the Closing Date (except to the extent such Taxes are actually taken  into account as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital or in the calculation of  Indebtedness in computing the adjustment to Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.04, were previously  paid by Seller, its Affiliates or any member of the Company Group prior to Closing as estimated Taxes or  were paid by Seller or its Affiliates as part of a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return of Seller, its  Affiliates or any member of the Company Group), and shall remit payment of such Pre-Closing Taxes to  the applicable taxing authority, no later than five Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due;  provided, however, that Buyer hereby assumes and agrees to pay directly the share of such Taxes relating  to  the  Company  Group  for  the  portion  of  any  Straddle  Period  beginning  after  the  Closing  Date,  in  accordance with the principles set forth in Section 5.12(f).                                          42 </FONT></DIV>

Such refunds  and credits  due to Seller shall not include  any Tax  refund or credit  attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute from a period beginning on or  after the Closing Date arising from an action taken by Buyer or the Company Group after the Closing.  Buyer and each member of the Company Group will be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment  from Seller of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with respect to any taxable period beginning  after  the  Closing  Date  relating  to  the  Company  Group.  Buyer  and  Seller  will  equitably  apportion  any  refund  or  credit  with  respect  to  Taxes  with  respect  to  any  Straddle  Period  in  accordance  with  the  principles  set  forth  in Section  5.12(f).  The  amount  of  any  refund  or  credit  which  Buyer  or  Seller is  entitled to retain or receive pursuant to this Section 5.12(c) shall be reduced to take account of any Taxes  payable as a result of the receipt of such refund or credit, and other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and  expenses incurred in connection therewith. All payments required to be  made pursuant to this Section  5.12(c) shall  be made  within  30  days  after  actually  realized  by  Seller,  Buyer  or  the  Company  (or  its  Subsidiaries), as the case may be (i.e., in the case of a refund, after actually receiving the cash Tax return,  and in the case of a credit, after such credit actually reduces a Tax otherwise due).         (d)   Seller shall not amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return, Tax election  or Tax accounting method with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of  Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Neither Buyer nor any of its  Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return, Tax election or Tax accounting  period, or enter into any voluntary disclosure Contract with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without  the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.         (e)   Buyer and Seller shall provide prompt written notice to the other upon receipt by Buyer,  Seller, any of their respective Affiliates or any member of the Company Group of notice of any pending  or  threatened  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign  Tax  audits,  examinations,  claims  for  refund,  judicial  proceedings  or assessments  which  might affect the Tax liabilities for which  Seller may be  responsible  pursuant to this Agreement (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to any asserted Tax  Liability referred to herein as a &#8220;Contest&#8221;). Seller shall have the right to represent the Company&#8217;s and its  Subsidiaries&#8217; interests in any Contest relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or otherwise relating to Taxes  for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this Agreement (other than Straddle Periods, in each case), to  employ counsel of its choice at its expense and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, Buyer or its  Affiliates shall cause a power of attorney to be issued to Seller&#8217;s or its Subsidiaries&#8217; representatives to  effect such representation. Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any such Contest at its expense, and  any settlement, compromise, or other disposition of any such Contest may only be made with the written  consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Seller does  not elect to control a Contest, fails to notify Buyer properly as provided above of its election to control a  Contest, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of a Contest, Buyer may control such Contest, but  such  Contest  shall  not  be  settled  or  compromised  without  Seller&#8217;s  consent,  which  shall  not  be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the case of a Straddle Period, Seller shall be entitled to  participate at its expense in any Contest relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion  of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and, with the written consent of Buyer, and at Seller&#8217;s  sole  expense,  may  assume  the  entire  control  of  such  Contest,  subject  to  Buyer&#8217;s  right  of  continued  participation.  Neither  Seller  (if  Seller  elects  to  control  such  Contest)  nor  any  of  Buyer,  any  of its  Affiliates or any member of the Company Group (if Seller does not so elect) shall compromise or settle or  otherwise dispose of any Contest relating to a Straddle Period without the consent of the non-controlling  party  unless  such  non-controlling  party shall  have  no  Liability  in  connection  with  such  settlement  or                                         43 </FONT></DIV>

(f)   In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a  &#8220;Straddle Period&#8221;), the portion of any Taxes that are treated as being for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for  purposes of this Agreement shall be: (a) in the case of Taxes other than property or similar ad valorem  Taxes, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if such taxable period ended at the close of  the Closing Date, determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the  Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in  which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and (b) in the  case of property or similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable  period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending  on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.         (g)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by  Law, any Tax or item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit resulting from any transaction engaged in  by any member of the Company Group on the Closing Date after the Closing or at the written direction of  Buyer that is not contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation any transaction engaged  in by any member of the Company Group in connection with the financing of any obligation of Buyer to  make a payment, shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period (or any taxable period or portion  thereof  of  Buyer)  beginning  on  the  day  after  the  Closing  Date  and  shall  not  be  allocated  to  any  Pre- Closing Tax Period nor result in Pre-Closing Taxes for which any member of the Company Group shall  be liable.         (h)   All tax sharing Contracts (or similar Contracts) and all powers of attorney with respect to  the Company Group shall be terminated prior to the Closing, and, after the Closing, no member of the  Company Group shall be bound thereby or have any Liability or obligation thereunder.         (i)   From  the  date  hereof  until  the  earlier  of  the  Closing  and  the  termination  of  this  Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01, no member of the Company Group shall make, change or  revoke any Tax election, surrender any Tax refund or right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction  in Tax Liability, change any annual Tax accounting period, amend any Tax Return, adopt or change any  accounting method in respect of Taxes, enter into any &#8220;closing agreement&#8221; described in Section 7121 of  the Code (or any similar provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law), settle or compromise any Tax audit  or Tax Liability, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any claim or  assessment in respect of any Taxes, or fail to make required payments of any Taxes (including estimated  Taxes).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that  Seller,  as  a  publicly  held  company,  is  subject  to  certain  disclosure  requirements  under  applicable  securities  laws  and  stock  exchange  rules  and,  therefore,  Buyer  agrees  that Seller  may  disclose  this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at any time Seller determines in good faith that such  disclosure is appropriate or desirable under such securities laws or rules; provided, however, that if such  disclosure is in the nature of a press release, Seller may make such disclosure only after complying with  the advance review procedures provided under the first sentence of this Section 5.14.

If an Indemnified Party actually receives any insurance or other third-party payment in connection with  any  claim  for  Loss  for  which  it  has  already  received  payment  under  this Article  VII such  that  such  Indemnified Party received an amount in connection therewith in excess of its related Loss (the &#8220;Excess  Recovery&#8221;),  it  shall  pay  to  the  Indemnifying  Party,  within  30  days  after  such  payment  is  actually  received, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of such insurance or other third-party payment  actually received with respect to such Loss and (ii) the Excess Recovery, in each case of the foregoing,  net of costs of collection, deductibles or premium increases associated therewith and any Taxes incurred  in connection therewith.

(f)   In  no  event  shall  any  Indemnifying  Party  be  liable  to  any  Indemnified  Party  for  any  punitive damages, in each case, unless such damages were actually awarded to a third party in connection  with a Third-Party Claim. In addition, solely with respect to a breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant,  agreement or obligation contained in Section 5.01 or Section 5.19, in no event shall Seller be liable to  Buyer  pursuant  to Section  7.02(b) for  any  incidental,  consequential,  special  or  indirect  damages,  including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business reputation or opportunity, or diminution of  value or any damages based on any type of multiple, unless such breach or non-fulfillment was the result  of, or was committed in, bad faith by Seller.          (g)   Each  Indemnified  Party  shall  take,  and  cause  its  Affiliates  to  take,  all commercially  reasonable  steps  to  mitigate  (which  shall  not  be  deemed  to  include  initiating  any  Action  against  any  Person) any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected  to, or does, give rise thereto.         (h)   Buyer shall not have any claim for Losses under this Article VII  to the extent such Loss  was  specifically  reflected  in  the  Closing  Working  Capital  estimate  or  the  Closing  Statement  or  was  actually  taken  into  account  in  the  calculation  of  the  Final  Purchase  Price  as  finally  determined  in  accordance with Section 2.04. No Person shall be entitled to indemnification for the same Loss more than  once under this Agreement, even if a claim for indemnification in respect of such Loss has been made as a  result of a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

The failure to give such prompt written  notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and  only  to the  extent  that  the  Indemnifying  Party  is  actually  and  materially  prejudiced  by  reason  of such  failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, to  the  extent  then  known,  shall  include  copies  of  all  material  written  evidence  thereof,  to  the  extent  reasonably available, and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that                                         54 </FONT></DIV>

Thereafter, the Indemnifying Party shall have  a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation into the facts and circumstances of such Third-Party  Claim and, following such investigation, shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified  Party,  to  assume  and  control  the  defense  of  such  Third-Party  Claim  at  its  expense  and  by  its  own  reputable counsel (and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense) so long as the  Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from  and  against  any  and  all  Losses  (including  Losses  remaining  after  deduction  of  the  then  remaining  Indemnity Escrow Amount, if applicable) arising out of or related to such Third-Party Claim, subject only  to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of Section 7.04(a); provided, however, that in the case of  an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 7.03(c), Buyer shall assume the defense of the Third-Party  Claim  related  thereto  upon  receipt  of  notice  from  the  Indemnified  Party  of  such  Third-Party  Claim.   Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the Indemnifying Party&#8217;s right to participate in the defense  of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume and control the defense  of  such  Third-Party  Claim  to  the  extent  that  (i)  the  Third-Party  Claim  seeks  an  injunction  or  other  equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised  by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim, (iii) the Third-Party Claim relates to or  otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (iv) settlement of, an  adverse judgment with respect to, or conduct of the defense of the Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying  Party is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the Indemnified Party&#8217;s continuing business interests  (including its relationships with current or potential customers, vendors or other parties material to the  conduct  of its  business),  or  (v) the  Indemnifying  Party  fails  to  conduct the  defense  of  the  Third-Party  Claim actively and diligently.  In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third- Party Claim (or is obligated to assume the defense as set forth in this Section 7.05(a)), subject to Section  7.05(b), it shall (x) have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to dispute, defend, appeal or  make  counterclaims  pertaining  to  any  such  Third-Party  Claim  in  the  name  and  on  behalf  of  the  Indemnified Party and (y) keep the Indemnified Party reasonably advised of the status of such Third-Party  Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Indemnified  Party with respect thereto. The Indemnified  Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to  participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying  Party&#8217;s right to control the defense thereof.

If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim (i) without leading to Liability or the creation  of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party, (ii) that does not involve a finding  or admission of wrongdoing or any violation of Law or the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party  or any of its Affiliates, (iii) that provides solely for the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying  Party and does not involve equitable or other non-monetary relief, and (iv) that provides, in customary  form, for the full and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations  in connection with such Third-Party Claim, and  the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to  such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the  Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the  Indemnified  Party  may  continue  to contest  or  defend  such  Third-Party  Claim  and  in  such  event,  the  maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of  such settlement offer.

(c)   Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not  result from a Third-Party Claim (a &#8220;Direct Claim&#8221;) shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the  Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall  not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the  extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such  notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail (to the extent then  known), shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof (to the extent reasonably available)  and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be  sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of such  notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall  allow  the  Indemnifying  Party  and  its  professional  advisors  to  investigate  the  matter  or  circumstance  alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect  of  the  Direct  Claim  and  the  Indemnified  Party  shall  use  reasonable  efforts  to  assist  the  Indemnifying  Party&#8217;s  investigation  by  giving  such  information  and  assistance  (including  reasonable  access  upon  reasonable  advance  notice  during  normal  business  hours,  and  in  a  manner that  does  not  unreasonably  interfere  with  the  normal  business  operations  of  Buyer  or  the  Company  Group,  to  the  Company&#8217;s  premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records that are  reasonably relevant to such investigation) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors  may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the  Indemnifying Party shall be  deemed  to have  rejected such claim, in which  case  the  Indemnified  Party  shall  be  free  to  pursue  such  remedies  as  may  be  available  to  the  Indemnified  Party  on  the  terms  and  subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company Group, agrees  that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such representation and any prior  representation of the Company Group by Thompson Coburn LLP (or any successor) (the &#8220;Seller Group  Law Firm&#8221;) shall not preclude Seller Group Law Firm from serving as counsel to the Seller Group or any  director, manager, member, shareholder, partner, officer or employee of the Seller Group, in connection  with any litigation, claim  or obligation arising out of or relating to this  Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated hereby.               (ii)  Buyer  shall  not,  and  shall  prohibit  any  member  of  the  Company  Group  from,  seeking or having the Seller Group Law Firm disqualified from any such representation based solely upon  the prior representation of the Company Group by the Seller Group Law Firm. Each of the parties hereto  hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, and  each of such parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising  from  such  representation.  Each  of  the  parties  hereto  acknowledges  that  such  consent  and  waiver  is  voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties hereto have consulted with counsel or  have  been  advised  they  should  do  so  in  connection  herewith.  The  covenants,  consent  and  waiver  contained in this Section 9.14 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Seller Group  Law Firm is entitled whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.         (b)   All privileged communications between the Seller Group or the Company Group, on the  one  hand,  and  the  Seller  Group  Law  Firm,  on  the  other  hand,  relating  to  the  negotiation,  preparation,  execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby  (the &#8220;Privileged Communications&#8221;) shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the expectation  of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Seller Group and shall not pass to or be  claimed by Buyer or any member of the Company Group. Accordingly, Buyer shall not have, and shall  prohibit  each  member  of  the  Company  Group  from  having,  any  right  to  access  to  any  Privileged  Communications or to the files of the Seller Group Law Firm relating to such engagement from and after  Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) the Seller Group  (and not Buyer or any member of the Company Group) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client  privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of Buyer or any member of the Company Group  shall  be  a  holder thereof, (ii) to the  extent that files  of the  Seller  Group  Law Firm  in  respect of  such  engagement constitute property of the client, only the Seller Group (and not Buyer nor any member of the  Company Group) shall hold such property rights and (iii) the Seller Group Law Firm shall have no duty  whatsoever  to  reveal  or  disclose  any  such  attorney-client communications  or  files  to  Buyer  or  any  member of the Company Group by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Seller Group  Law  Firm  and  the  Company  Group  or  otherwise.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  a  dispute arises between Buyer or its Affiliates (including any member of the Company Group), on the one  hand, and a third party other than any of the Seller Group, on the other hand, Buyer and its Affiliates  (including  such  member  of  the  Company  Group)  may  assert  the  attorney-client  privilege  to  prevent  disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor  any  of  its  Affiliates  (including  any  member  of  the  Company  Group)  may  waive  such  privilege,  with  respect to any dispute between the parties hereto, without the prior written consent of the Seller Group,  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that Buyer or any  of  its  Affiliates  (including  any  member  of  the  Company  Group)  is  legally required  by  Governmental  Authority or otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged  Communications,  to  the  extent  (x)  permitted  by  applicable  Law,  and  (y)  advisable  in  the  opinion  of  Buyer&#8217;s  counsel,  then  Buyer  shall  immediately  (and,  in  any  event,  within  five  days)  notify  Seller  in  writing so that Seller can seek a protective order.                                         64 </FONT></DIV>
