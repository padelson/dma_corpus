(a) No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, Cantor shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to eSpeed a balance sheet (the "
_Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth Cantors good-faith
estimates of (i) the Closing Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (ii)
the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (iii)
the Closing Net Equity (the " _Estimated Closing Net Equity_ "). Cantor shall
give, and shall cause its advisors, accountants and representatives to give,
eSpeed, the eSpeed Special Committee and their respective advisors,
accountants and representatives access to such books, records, work papers and
personnel of Cantor as may be reasonably necessary to understand the
calculations set forth in the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet.

(b) Within ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, Cantor shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Surviving Corporation a
statement (the " _Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet_ ") setting forth Cantors
calculation of (i) the Closing Cash (the " _Adjusted Closing Cash_ "), (ii)
the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Adjusted Closing Indebtedness_ "), and (iii)
the Closing Net Equity (the " _Adjusted Closing Net Equity_ "). Cantor shall
give, and shall cause its advisors, accountants and representatives to give,
the Surviving Corporation, the Audit Committee of the Surviving Corporation
and their respective  



 

-17-  advisors, accountants and representatives access to such books, records,
work papers and personnel of Cantor as may be reasonably necessary to
understand the calculations set forth in the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the
date on which the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet is delivered to it to assess
the preparation and confirm the accuracy of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Cash, Adjusted Closing
Indebtedness and the Adjusted Closing Net Equity (the " _Review Period_ ").
If the Surviving Corporation believes in good faith that the Adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet (or the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Cash, the Adjusted
Closing Indebtedness or the Adjusted Closing Net Equity) is inaccurate, the
Surviving Corporation may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a written notice to Cantor setting forth, in reasonable detail, each
disputed item or amount and the basis for the Surviving Corporations
disagreement therewith, together with supporting calculations and
documentation (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Surviving Corporation and the
Audit Committee of the Surviving Corporation shall give, and shall cause
their respective advisors, accountants and representatives to give, Cantor and
its advisors, accountants and representatives access to such books, records,
work papers and personnel of the Surviving Corporation and the Audit Committee
of the Surviving Corporation as may be reasonably necessary to understand the
calculations set forth in the Dispute Notice.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation delivers to Cantor a Dispute Notice on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Surviving Corporation and
Cantor shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes properly
identified in such Dispute Notice. If Cantor and the Surviving Corporation
agree in writing on resolution of all disputes properly identified in such
Dispute Notice, then the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, the Adjusted Closing
Cash, the Adjusted Closing Indebtedness and the Adjusted Closing Net Equity,
each as modified by such agreement of the Surviving Corporation and Cantor,
shall be and become final and binding on the Parties. If the Parties are
unable to resolve all disputed items in such Dispute Notice within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the Surviving Corporations delivery of such
Dispute Notice to Cantor, they shall promptly thereafter cause an Accounting
Referee promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Net Equity. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider
only those items or amounts as to which Cantor and the Surviving Corporation
have disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Cantor and the
Surviving Corporation a report setting forth such calculation. Cantor and the
Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Accounting Referee to deliver such report within 30 days following
appointment of the Accounting Referee. Such report shall be final and binding
upon Cantor and the Surviving Corporation. The cost of such review and report
shall be borne in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the
items unsuccessfully disputed by each (as finally determined by the
Accounting Referee) bears to the total amount of the disputed items. Cantor
and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly reimburse the other to the extent
that the other paid more than the amount so required pursuant to the
preceding sentence. " _Accounting Referee_ " shall mean an internationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Cantor and the
Audit Committee of the Surviving Corporation. 



 

-18- (e) Cantor and the Surviving Corporation will, and will cause their respective
independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the calculation of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Equity and in the conduct
of the review by the Accounting Referee referred to in this _Section 2.8_,
including the making available to the extent necessary of books, records,
work papers and personnel.

(f) If (i) the Final Net Equity differs from the Target Closing Net Equity,
(ii) the Final Closing Cash differs from the Target Closing Cash and/or (iii)
the Final Closing Indebtedness differs from the Target Closing Indebtedness,
then Cantor, on the one hand, and the Opcos, on the other hand, shall pay
an amount of cash to the other as is necessary so that the Closing Net
Equity, the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness (taking into account
such payment of cash) is equal to the Target Closing Net Equity, the Target
Closing Cash and the Target Closing Indebtedness, respectively; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the extent that the payment of cash is not sufficient to
cause the Closing Net Equity, the Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness
(taking into account such payment of cash) to equal the Target Closing Net
Equity, the Target Closing Cash and the Target Closing Indebtedness,
respectively, then Cantor and the Opcos shall take such other additional
actions (including the transfer of assets, incurrence of Indebtedness, the
creation of intercompany receivables or payables) as mutually agreed between
Cantor and the Surviving Corporation so that the Closing Net Equity, the
Closing Cash and the Closing Indebtedness (taking into account the payment
of cash and such other additional actions) is equal to the Target Closing Net
Equity, the Target Closing Cash and the Target Closing Indebtedness,
respectively.

(g) If the Opcos shall be obligated to make any payment to Cantor, or if any
payments shall be owed from the Opcos to Cantor, pursuant to _Sections 2.8(f)_
, then the Surviving Corporation shall determine the proportion of such
payment that shall be made by U.S. Opco, on the one hand, and Global Opco, on
the other hand, and the proportion of such payment that shall be owed by U.S.
Opco, on the one hand, and Global Opco, on the other hand (it
being understood that such determination shall not change the fact that the
Opcos shall be jointly and severally liable for any obligation pursuant to
_Sections 2.8(f)_ ).

Sheet, if no Dispute Notice with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to

following the Closing Date. The License shall not be transferable except to

provided under the License) to create a fully electronic brokerage system that
competes with eSpeeds fully electronic systems for U.S. Treasuries and
foreign exchange; (ii) BGC Partners shall be a third-party beneficiary of the

any such employee ( _provided_ that Cantor and its Subsidiaries may not
hire any such person if, as a result and without hiring additional personnel,
BGC Partners and its Subsidiaries would not be able to continue to maintain
and develop their Intellectual Property in a manner consistent with past
practice). Cantor and its Subsidiaries shall provide a list of such persons
promptly following the Closing Date).

 7.6 _Exchange Listing_. eSpeed will use reasonable best efforts to cause the

Stockholder Meeting_ ") to be held to consider adoption of this Agreement.
Cantor, BGC Partners, U.S. Opco, Global Opco and Holdings shall furnish all

the right to review in advance and approve the Proxy Statement prior to its
filing and mailing to stockholders. As promptly as practicable following the
earliest date on which it is permitted under the applicable SEC rules and

on the Proxy Statement have been resolved), eSpeed shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by
eSpeed, without providing Cantor and BGC Partners a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the any of the Parties should be discovered by any
Party which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy

describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the

accordance with the mutual agreement of BGC Partners and eSpeed. The Board of
Directors of eSpeed and the eSpeed Special Committee shall recommend that the
eSpeed stockholders adopt this Agreement, and shall take all lawful action to
solicit such adoption and approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of
eSpeed or the eSpeed Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel that its fiduciary duties to eSpeed or its
stockholders under Applicable Law require it to withdraw, revoke, modify or
qualify its recommendation, the Board of Directors of eSpeed and the eSpeed
Special Committee may do so; _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, eSpeeds
obligation to convene the eSpeed Stockholder Meeting in accordance with this
_Section 7.8_ shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by any such
change in recommendation. So long as the Board of Directors of eSpeed and the
eSpeed Special Committee recommend in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement, at every eSpeed Stockholder Meeting called with respect to
the adoption of this Agreement and at every adjournment and postponement

period of time not to exceed 120 days if all other conditions to consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are satisfied or capable

(ii) the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to any Party to this Agreement whose failure to perform

contained in this Agreement, which breach by its nature is not curable or has

-54-  ARTICLE X

INDEMNIFICATION AND ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN LOSSES

effect until the first anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.7_
(Capitalization) shall survive the Closing and continue to be in full force
and effect indefinitely (each such period, as applicable the " _Indemnity
Period_ "). None of the representations and warranties contained in Article
V of this Agreement or in any Schedule to this Agreement, or in any
certificate, document or other instrument delivered in connection with this
Agreement, including the officers certificate to be delivered by eSpeed
pursuant to  _Section 8.3(c)_, shall survive the Effective Time. Those
covenants that contemplate or may involve actions to be taken or obligations
in effect after the Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms.

 10.2 _Indemnification; Allocation of Certain Losses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Article X_ , from and after the
Closing Date, Cantor shall indemnify and hold harmless Opco and its
Subsidiaries, and each of their heirs, executors, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and out of any Losses to
the extent resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of BGC Partners, Cantor, U.S. Opco, Global Opco or
Holdings contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder
(but only if a claim therefor is presented to Cantor in accordance with this
Agreement before the Indemnity Period terminates in accordance with this
Agreement) (it being understood that (x) in determining the amount of Loss
under this  _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ from any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy, all references
to "material," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications as
to materiality shall be deleted therefrom, and (y) in determining the amount
of Loss under this _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ from any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty contained in _Sections 4.5_ , and for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy in any such
representation or warranty for purposes of this _Article X_ , the Actions
marked with an asterisk on _Schedule 4.5_ of the BGC Partners Disclosure
Schedule shall not be taken into account); or (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed by BGC Partners,
Cantor, U.S. Opco, Global Opco or Holdings; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
Cantor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses resulting from or arising out of the any matter set forth on _Schedule
10.2_ of the BGC Partners Disclosure Schedule (such matter, the " _Special
Items_ "); and (2) Cantors indemnification obligations with respect to the
Actions marked with an asterisk on _Schedule 4.5_ of the BGC Partners
Disclosure Schedule shall be limited to Losses resulting from the imposition
of any fine or other monetary penalty, or the payment of any amount in
settlement, resulting from such Actions.



 

-55- (b) _Allocation of Certain Losses_. From and after the Closing, any Losses of
U.S. Opco and Global Opco and its Subsidiaries to the extent resulting from
or arising out of the Special Items (the " _Allocable Losses_ ") shall be
allocated to Holdings pursuant to terms of the New U.S. Opco Limited
Partnership Agreement and the New Global Opco Limited Partnership Agreement,
which allocated Losses of Holdings shall be allocated to the capital accounts
of the Limited Partnership Interests of Holdings held by Cantor and the
Founding Partners (each as defined in the New Holdings Limited Partnership
Agreement) pursuant to the terms of the New Holdings Limited Partnership
Agreement.

 10.3 _Notification_.

(a) Any Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification under this Agreement may
seek indemnification for any Loss by giving written notice to Cantor (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), specifying (i) the basis for such indemnification
claim and (ii) if known, the aggregate amount of Loss for which a claim is
being made under this _Article X_. Written notice to such Indemnifying Party
of the event giving rise to such claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party
as soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party first receives notice of
the potential claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to provide
such written notice of the event giving rise to such claim shall not affect
the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification or relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent that
such failure results in a lack of actual notice to Cantor of the event giving
rise to such claim and Cantor actually incurs an incremental expense or
otherwise has been materially prejudiced as a result of such delay.

(b) The Surviving Corporation may seek to have an Allocable Loss allocated to
Holdings by giving written notice to Cantor, specifying (i) the basis for its
claim of breach and (ii) if known, the aggregate amount of Allocable Losses
for which a claim of breach is being made. Written notice to such Indemnifying
Party of the event giving rise to such claim shall be given by the
Indemnified Party as soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party first
receives notice of the potential claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
failure to provide such written notice of the event giving rise to such claim
shall not affect the Indemnified Partys right to have such Allocable Losses
allocated pursuant to this _Article X_ except to the extent that such failure
results in a lack of actual notice to Cantor of the event giving rise to such
indemnification claim and Cantor actually incurs an incremental expense or
otherwise has been materially prejudiced as a result of such delay.

 10.4 _Third-Party Claims_.

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against an Indemnified Party, or
with respect to which U.S. Opco or Global Opco may incur an Allocable Loss
pursuant to this Agreement, and if the Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity (or U.S. Opco or Global Opco intends to allocate an Allocable Loss)
with respect thereto under this _Article X_ , such Indemnified Party, shall
promptly notify Cantor of such claims (collectively, a " _Third-Party Claim_
") (and in any event not more than 30 days after receiving such actual notice
of such Third-Party Claim). The failure to provide such notice in accordance
with _Section 11.2_ shall not result in a waiver of any right to
indemnification or right to allocate such Allocable Loss hereunder except to
the extent that such failure results in a lack of actual notice to Cantor of
the event



 

-56-  giving rise to such indemnification claim and Cantor actually incurs an
incremental expense or otherwise has been materially prejudiced as a result of
such delay.

(b) Cantor may elect (but is not required) to assume the defense of and defend
such Third-Party Claim solely at its own expense;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Indemnity Period has not expired at the time of such Third-Party
Claim, Cantor may only exercise its rights pursuant to this sentence if Cantor
acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that such Third-Party Claim
is indemnifiable or allocable under this Agreement or another Transaction
Agreement. Within 30 days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified
Party (or the Surviving Corporation in the case of an Allocable Loss) in
accordance with _Section 11.2_, Cantor shall notify the Indemnified Party or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its election whether it will
assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim. If Cantor elects
to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
may participate in such defense, but, as long as Cantor pursues such defense
with reasonable diligence, the expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred in
participating in such defense shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.

(c) Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
including, if known, the amount of the Loss or Allocable Losses or a good
faith estimate thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any
Indemnified Party or other Person to give notice within the 30-day period
shall not prohibit indemnification under this  _Article X_ or the allocation
of any Allocable Losses pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent that
the failure to provide such notice results in a lack of actual notice of the
event giving rise to such claim to the Person to whom such Allocable Losses
are to be allocated pursuant to this Agreement and such Person incurs and
incremental expense or otherwise has been materially prejudiced.

(d) Cantor shall have the right to compromise or settle a Third-Party Claim
the defense of which it shall have assumed pursuant to this _Section 10.4_
and any such settlement or compromise made or caused to be made of a Third-
Party Claim in accordance with this _Article X_ shall be binding on the
Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Cantor shall not have the right to
admit Liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and shall not compromise or
settle a Third-Party Claim in each case without the express prior consent of
the Indemnified Party or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, the Surviving
Corporation (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ that such
prior consent shall not be required in the case of any such compromise or
settlement if and only if the compromise or settlement includes, as a part
thereof, a full and unconditional release by the plaintiff or claimant of all
Indemnified Parties or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, U.S. Opco and
Global Opco from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and does
not require any Indemnified Party or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, U.S.
Opco and Global Opco to make any payment that is not fully indemnified or
not allocated under this Agreement or to be subject to any non-monetary
remedy. The Indemnified Party or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, U.S. Opco
and Global Opco shall not pay or settle any claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, the
Surviving Corporation (in each case, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified  



 

-57-  Party or, in the case of an Allocable Loss, U.S. Opco and Global Opco shall
have the right to pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ that, in
such event, it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by Cantor.

 10.5 _Limits on Indemnifiable Losses_.

(a) No indemnification shall be made by Cantor with respect to any claim made
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate of all Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ shall exceed $20 million (the "
_Deductible Amount_ "), in which event Cantor shall be responsible only for
such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ that that no
indemnification shall be made by Cantor with respect to any claim made
pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ (taking into account for
these purposes any Losses excluded as a result of the Deductible Amount or
_Section 10.5(b)_) is in excess of an amount equal to (x) $170 million (it
being agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall bear the first $20 million of
such Losses), _minus_ (y) the amount of indemnification payments that have
been made pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ prior to the time of such claim,
_minus_ (z) the lesser of (A) $85 million and (B) the amount of Allocable
Losses that have been allocated to Holdings pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_
prior to the time of the final resolution of such claim. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Cantor shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect
to any Loss (or series of related Losses) pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ if
such Loss (or series of related Losses) from such breach is less than $50,000
or included or reflected as a liability in the Final Closing Balance Sheet,
and such Loss (or series of related Losses) shall not be included in the
calculation of the amounts specified in this _Section 10.5._

(c) Cantor shall be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ only for those claims giving rise to any Loss as to which
such Indemnified Party has given Cantor written notice prior to the end
of the applicable Indemnity Period, in the event that such Indemnity Period
applies to such Loss in accordance with _Section 10.3_.

 10.6 _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Parties (and, in the case of any
Allocable Loss, the Surviving Corporation) shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or
liability that an Indemnified Party asserts under this _Article X_ or that the
Surviving Corporation seeks to allocate to Holdings under this _Article X_.

 10.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in
this Agreement, except in the case of a fraud or willful misconduct on the
part of a Party hereto and except as specifically set forth in this _Article
X_ , there shall be no rights, claims or remedies (whether in Law or in
equity) available to any Indemnified Party after the Closing for breaches by
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of
BGC Partners, Cantor, U.S. Opco, Global Opco or Holdings under this Agreement
or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  



 

-58-  hereby; _provided_ that the Parties hereto shall each have and retain all
rights and remedies to bring actions for specific performance
and/or injunctive relief existing in their favor under this Agreement, at Law
or equity, to enforce or prevent a breach or violation of any provision of
this Agreement.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 11.5 _Specific Performance_. The Parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties to this Agreement hereby agree
that any Party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party
may be entitled at Law or in equity.

 11.6 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts-of-law
principles of such State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (and agrees that no
such action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought
by it or any of  



 

-61-  its subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Persons
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately
preceding sentence. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 11.7 _Severability_. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein,
or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the
remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired, unless the
provisions held invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall substantially impair
the benefits of the remaining provisions hereof.

 11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and
schedules hereto and the Transaction Documents are intended by the Parties as
a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein. There are no
restrictions, promises, representations, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. This Agreement,
together with the exhibits and schedules hereto, and the Transaction Documents
supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties with
respect to such subject matter.

 11.9 _Expenses_. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
attorneys and other advisors fees) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that
the costs and expenses of BGC Partners or Cantor and its Subsidiaries incurred
prior to the Effective Time shall be, if applicable, reflected in the
calculation of the Closing Cash and Closing Net Equity).



 

-62-  11.10 _Publicity; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to _Section 11.11_ and unless otherwise agreed by the Party to
whom such Covered Information relates, each of the Parties agrees to hold, and
to cause each member of its respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, general partners, agents, accountants, managing member,
employees, counsel and other advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to hold, in strict confidence, with at least the same
degree of care that applies to Cantors confidential and proprietary
Information pursuant to policies in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
all Information concerning each such other Party (including such Persons
clients, transactions, business, Assets, Liabilities, performance or
operations) that is either in its possession (including Information in its
possession prior to the date of this Agreement) or furnished by any such other
Party or its Representatives at any time pursuant to this Agreement, any
Transaction Document or otherwise (collectively, " _Covered Information_ "),
except that the following shall not be deemed to be Covered Information: any
such Information to the extent that (i) at the time of disclosure such
Information is generally available to and known by the public (other than as
a result of a disclosure by the disclosing Party or by any of its
Representatives in breach of this _Section 11.10_) or (ii) such Information
has after the Effective Time been lawfully acquired from other sources by such
Party on a non-public basis which sources are, to the knowledge of the Party
acquiring such Information, not themselves bound by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation that would limit or prohibit disclosure of such
Information.

(b) Subject to _Section 11.11_ and unless otherwise agreed by the Party to
whom such Covered Information relates, each Party agrees (i) not to use any
Covered Information other than for such purposes as shall be expressly
permitted hereunder or under any Transaction Document and (ii) not to release
or disclose, or permit to be released or disclosed, any Covered Information
to any other Person, except its Representatives who need to know such Covered
Information (who shall be advised of their obligations hereunder with respect
to such Covered Information), except in compliance with  _Section 11.11_.
Without limiting the foregoing, when any Covered Information is no longer
needed for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, each Party will promptly after request of the Party that provided
such Covered Information either return to such Party all such Covered
Information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes,
analyses, presentations, extracts or summaries based thereon) or certify to
the other Party that it has destroyed such Covered Information (and such
copies thereof and such notes, extracts, analyses, presentations or summaries
based thereon). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Covered
Information, such Party will continue to be bound by its obligations of
confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.

 11.11 _Protective Arrangements_. In the event that any Party determines on
the advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose any Covered
Information of any other Party (or any member of such other Partys
Subsidiaries) pursuant to Applicable Law or receives any demand under lawful
process or from any Governmental Authority to disclose or provide Covered
Information of any other Party (or any member of such other
Partys Subsidiaries), such Party shall, to the extent practicable and unless
otherwise required by Law, notify the other Party prior to disclosing or
providing such Covered Information and shall cooperate at the expense of the
requesting Party in seeking any reasonable protective arrangements requested
by such other Party. Subject to the foregoing, the Person that received such
request may thereafter disclose or provide Covered Information if and  



 

-63-  to the extent required by such Law (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful
process or such Governmental Authority; _provided_ , that the Person
shall only disclose such portion of the Covered Information so required to be
disclosed or provided.

 11.12 _Action by eSpeed_. In order for any consent or waiver provided by
eSpeed under this Agreement, or for any amendment or modification to this
Agreement executed by eSpeed, to be valid, such consent, waiver, amendment or
modification must be approved by the eSpeed Special Committee (if such
consent, waiver, amendment or modification shall be made prior to the Closing)
or by the Audit Committee of the Surviving Corporation (if such consent,
waiver, amendment or modification shall be made after the Closing).

 11.13 _Further Assurances_. Each of the Parties shall execute such documents
and perform such further acts (including, obtaining any consents, exemptions,
authorizations or other actions by, or giving any notices to, or making any
filings with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person) as may be
reasonably required or desirable to carry out or to perform the provisions of
this Agreement.
