_Section 2.04. Conversion of Roma Financial Common Stock. _

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Mid-Tier Merger and without any action

shares of Roma Financial Common Stock:

(a) All shares of Roma Financial Common Stock held in the treasury of Roma
Financial ("Treasury Stock"), shares held by the Roma Bank ESOP that are
returned to Roma Financial immediately prior to the Effective Time as
contemplated by Section 6.07(e) herein, and each share of Roma
Financial Common Stock owned by Investors Bancorp immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with debts previously contracted) shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and the Certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor.

(b) Subject to Section 2.04(a), each share of Roma Financial Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the terms set forth in
this Agreement, the right to receive 0.8653 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Investors Bancorp Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

 

(c) After the Effective Time, shares of Roma Financial Common Stock shall be
no longer outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this section only represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(d) In the event Investors Bancorp changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Investors
Bancorp Common Stock issued and outstanding at or prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Investors Bancorp Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to
the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and
appropriately adjusted; _provided_ ,

 



11   _that_ no such adjustment shall be made with regard to Investors Bancorp
Common Stock if Investors Bancorp issues additional shares of Investors
Bancorp Common Stock and receives fair market value consideration for such
shares.

_Section 2.05 Procedures for Exchange of Roma Financial Common Stock. _

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Investors Bancorp shall reserve
sufficient shares of Investors Bancorp Common Stock equal to the aggregate
amount of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.04 of this
Article II (such shares of Investors Bancorp Common Stock together with cash
in lieu of fractional shares to be paid in accordance with Section 2.05(i)
hereof being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

(b) Investors Bancorp shall cause the Exchange Agent, as promptly as
practical following the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5)
business days after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a
Certificate or Certificates, a form letter of transmittal for return to the
Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for the Merger Consideration into which the Roma Financial Common
Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as a result
of the Mid-Tier Merger. The letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration and a check representing any cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares which such former holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Certificate(s) surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.05, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration.

 

(c) The holder of a Certificate shall have no rights, after the Effective
Time, with respect to such Roma Financial Common Stock except to surrender
the Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares) as provided in this Agreement. No dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect
to Investors Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate(s) until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate(s) in
accordance with this Section 2.05. After the surrender of any Certificate(s)
in accordance with this Section 2.05, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares
of Investors Common Stock. 

(d) If the Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying
letter of transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a
condition of the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such
Certificate is properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of
the record holder appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper
form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority
of the Person surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of
transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for
any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Roma Financial of the Roma Financial Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than to settle transfers of Roma Financial Common Stock that occurred prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares) and canceled as provided in this Article II.

(f) Neither Investors Bancorp nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such Certificate to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law.

 



12 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange
Agent or Investors Bancorp, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

(h) Investors Bancorp or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Roma Financial Common
Stock such amounts as Investors Bancorp (or any Affiliate thereof) or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S. Federal,
state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by Investors Bancorp or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Roma Financial Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by Investors Bancorp or the Exchange Agent.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Investors Bancorp Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Investors Bancorp Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a shareholder of Investors Bancorp. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Investors Bancorp shall pay to each
former holder of Roma Financial Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled
to receive a fractional share of Investors Bancorp Common Stock, an amount in
cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
Investors Bancorp Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the ten
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes
of determining any fractional share interest, all shares of Roma Financial
Common Stock owned by a Roma Financial shareholder shall be combined so as to
calculate the maximum number of whole shares of Investors Bancorp Common
Stock issuable to such Roma Financial shareholder.

_Section 2.06 Treatment of Roma Financial Options. _

(a) At the Effective Time, all Roma Financial Options issued under the Roma
Financial 2008 Equity Incentive Plan that are outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto, whether vested or unvested, shall be, in accordance
with their terms, become fully vested and converted, in their entirety,

Financial 2008 Equity Incentive Plan):

the Continuing Options shall be equal to the product of the number of shares
of Roma Financial Common Stock subject to the Roma Financial Options and the
Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Investors Bancorp
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share; and

(2) The exercise price per share of Investors Bancorp Common Stock under the
Continuing Options shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Roma
Financial Common Stock under the Roma Financial Options divided by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent. 

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are
"incentive stock options" (as defined in IRC Section 422) shall be and is
intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of
the IRC. The duration and other terms of the Continuing Options shall be the
same as the Roma Financial Options, except that all references to
Roma Financial shall be deemed to be references to Investors Bancorp.

 



13 (b) At all times after the Effective Time, Investors Bancorp shall reserve for
issuance such number of shares of Investors Bancorp Common Stock as necessary
so as to permit the exercise of Continuing Options in the manner contemplated
by this Agreement and in the instruments pursuant to which such options were
granted. Shares of Investors Bancorp Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Continuing Options shall be covered by an effective registration statement on
Form S-8, and Investors shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
covering such shares as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than 10 business days thereafter.

status thereof, Roma Financial has made available to Investors Bancorp true

(b) To the Knowledge of Roma Financial, each Roma Financial Compensation and

accordance with its terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited
to, ERISA, the IRC, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, Part G of Subtitle I of ERISA and Section

ERISA.

(c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Roma Financial

ERISA or Section 414 of the IRC (an "Roma Financial ERISA Affiliate") since
the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and no

Roma Financial Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the "benefit
liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such Roma
Financial Defined Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year
with respect to the respective Roma Financial Defined Benefit Plan ending
prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Roma Financial Defined
Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; there is not currently pending with the

might be required with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby). Neither Roma Financial nor any Roma Financial ERISA
Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. Neither Roma Financial, nor any Roma Financial ERISA
Affiliate, nor any Roma Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any
Roma Financial Defined Benefit Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor
any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which Roma Financial, any Roma Financial ERISA Affiliate, and
any Roma Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any Roma
Financial Defined Benefit Plan or any such trust or any trustee or
administrator thereof, could reasonably be expected to be subject to either a

Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health, life insurance, or
disability insurance, or any retiree death benefits under any Roma Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by COBRA. There

Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
employees retiree health, life insurance, or disability insurance, or any
retiree death benefits.

Plan.

 

(i) Neither Roma Financial nor any Roma Subsidiary maintains any compensation

issued thereunder.

employee stock ownership, restricted stock, stock option, 

 



36  stock appreciation, phantom stock, severance, welfare benefit, and fringe
benefit plans and all other benefit practices, policies and arrangements
maintained by Investors Bancorp or any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary and in
which employees in general may participate (the "Investors Compensation and
Benefit Plans").

(b) To the Knowledge of Investors Bancorp, each Investors Compensation and
Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and with applicable law, including, but not limited
to, ERISA, the IRC, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA, and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the IRC, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, and HIPAA and any other

Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a determination
letter issued to the sponsor of a master or prototype plan, and Investors
Bancorp is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely
to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is
no material pending or, to the Knowledge of Investors Bancorp, threatened
action, suit or claim relating to any of the Investors Compensation and
Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). Neither Investors
Bancorp nor any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or
omitted to take any action, with respect to any Investors Compensation and
Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject Investors Bancorp
or any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary to a material unpaid tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the IRC or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

(c) No liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums arising

Bancorp or any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary with respect to any Investors
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA
("Investors Defined Benefit Plan") currently or formerly maintained by
Investors Bancorp or any entity which is considered one employer with
Investors Bancorp under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the IRC
(an "Investors ERISA Affiliate"). No Investors Defined Benefit Plan had
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 431 of the IRC),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan
year ending prior to the date hereof. The fair market value of the assets of
each Investors Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the benefits
guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA under such Investors Defined Benefit
Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year with respect to the respective
Investors Defined Benefit Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial
valuation for such Investors Defined Benefit Plan as of the date hereof; and
no notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived has been required
to be filed for any Investors Defined Benefit Plan within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof. Neither Investors Bancorp nor any of its Investors
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
Investors Defined Benefit Plan or has taken any action, or omitted to take any
action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the IRC or pursuant to ERISA.
Neither Investors Bancorp nor any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary nor any
Investors ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after January 1, 1998.

(d) All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Investors Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made, and all
anticipated contributions and funding obligations are accrued on Investors
Bancorps consolidated financial statements to the extent required by GAAP.

liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable Investors
Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes to the extent
required by GAAP.

37  fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which it holds a lien, results or
resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to
impose a material liability (including a material remediation obligation)
upon Investors Bancorp or any of Investors Bancorp Subsidiary. To the
Knowledge of Investors Bancorp, no condition has existed or event has occurred
with respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice or the

any such fees and charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process,
if for any reason the Mid-Tier Merger is not consummated for any reason other

employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives, such
reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the period before

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to any partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Roma Financial shall permit Investors Bancorp, at Investors Bancorps
expense, to cause a "phase I environmental audit" and a "phase II
environmental audit" to be performed at each branch of Roma Bank at any time
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Investors Bancorp
shall have the right to conduct a "phase II environmental audit" prior to the
Closing only to the extent that a "phase II environmental audit" is within
the scope of additional testing recommended by the "phase I environmental
audit" to be performed as a result of a "Recognized Environmental Condition"
(as such term is defined by ASTM International) that was discovered in
the "phase I environmental audit," and provided that as to any "phase II
environmental audits" performed at a branch which is leased, the landlord
pursuant to the applicable lease has consented to such "phase II
environmental audit" if such consent is necessary pursuant to the lease. Roma
Bank will use their commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Roma Bank)
to obtain such landlord consent. Prior to performing any "phase II
environmental audits," Investors Bancorp will provide Roma Bank with a copy
of its proposed work plan and Investors Bancorp will cooperate in good faith
with Roma Bank to address any comments or suggestions made by Roma Bank
regarding the work plan. Investors Bancorp and its environmental consultant
shall conduct all environmental assessments pursuant to this Section at
mutually agreeable times and so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest
extent possible interference with the operation of the banks business, and

insurance with respect to any assessment conducted hereunder. Investors
Bancorp shall be required to restore each such property to substantially
its pre-assessment condition. All costs and expenses incurred in connection

Financial is a party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle
or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or
resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in
principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by Roma Financial or any
Representative, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and
whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Roma
Financial or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
by Roma Financial. Roma Financial and each Roma Subsidiary shall, and shall
cause each of Roma Financial Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and
communications with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential
Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Investors Bancorp), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Roma MHC, Roma Financial or any Roma
Subsidiary; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any third party (other than
Investors Bancorp or any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary) or group acquires or
would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly, any assets of Roma MHC, Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary
representing, in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
assets of Roma MHC, Roma Financial and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into,
such securities) representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the votes
attached to the outstanding securities of Roma Financial or any Roma
Subsidiary; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity securities of Roma
Financial or any Roma Subsidiary; or (E) any transaction which is similar in
form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any
combination of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(a), Roma MHC and Roma Financial may take any
of the actions described in clauses (ii) and (iv) of Section 5.10(a) if, but
only if, prior to the date of the Roma Financial Shareholders Meeting: (i)
Roma Financial has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.10; (ii) the Roma
Financial Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; (iii) prior to furnishing or affording
access to any information or data with respect to Roma Financial or any Roma
Subsidiary or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Roma Financial
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to Roma Financial than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. Roma Financial shall promptly provide to Investors
Bancorp any non-public information regarding Roma Financial or any Roma
Subsidiary provided to any other Person that was not previously provided to
Investors Bancorp, such additional information to be provided no later than
the date of provision of such information to such other party.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (or its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition 

 



46  Transaction on terms that the Roma Financial Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor: (i) would, if consummated,
result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and
outstanding shares of Roma Financial Common Stock or all, or substantially
all, of the assets of Roma Financial and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis; (ii) would result in a transaction that involves consideration to the
holders of the shares of Roma Financial Common Stock that is more favorable,
from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to Roma
Financials shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other
things, the nature of the consideration being offered and which proposal is
not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing and (iii) is
reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal, including any material regulatory approvals or other risks
associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition
to those specifically contemplated hereby.

(c) Roma Financial and/or Roma MHC shall promptly (and in any event within
two business days) notify Investors Bancorp in writing if any proposals or
offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, Roma MHC, Roma
Financial or any Roma Financial Representatives, in each case in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the
Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) unless: (i) such materials constitute confidential information
of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality
agreement, (ii) disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client
privilege or (iii) disclosure of such materials contravenes any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree. Roma Financial agrees that it shall
keep Investors Bancorp informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms
of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

 

(d) Neither the Roma Financial Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Investors Bancorp in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers), the Roma Financial
Recommendation (as defined in Section 7.01), or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with Roma Financial Shareholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the Roma Financial Recommendation (it being understood that
taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the Roma Financial
Recommendation); or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(d), prior to the date of the Roma Financial
Shareholders Meeting, the Roma Financial Board may approve or recommend to
the shareholders of Roma Financial a Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify
or modify the Roma Financial Recommendation in connection therewith (a "Roma
Financial Subsequent Determination") after the third (3rd) Business Day
following Investors Bancorps receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from Roma Financial advising Investors Bancorp that the Roma
Financial Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that Roma Financial
shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of
any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its affiliates that
Roma Financial proposes to accept and the subsequent notice period shall be
two (2) business days) if, but only if, (i) the Roma Financial Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, that
the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to Roma Financials shareholders under applicable
law, and (ii) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period or the two (2)
Business Day Period (as the case may be), after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been committed to in writing
by Investors Bancorp since its receipt of such Notice

 



47  of Superior Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Investors Bancorp shall
not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), the Roma Financial
Board has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this
Section 5.10(e) and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall prohibit Roma Financial or
the Roma Financial Board from complying with Roma Financials obligations
required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _howeve_ r, that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition

disclosure.

loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including

Financial shall also consult with respect to the character, amount and timing
of restructuring charges to be taken by each of them in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take such charges as Investors
Bancorp shall reasonably request and which are not inconsistent with GAAP,
provided that no such actions need be effected until Investors Bancorp shall
have irrevocably certified to Roma Financial that all conditions set forth in
Article VIII to the obligation of Investors Bancorp to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than the delivery of certificates or
opinions) have been satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived.

_Section 5.12 Board of Directors and Committee Meetings. _

Each Roma Party shall permit representatives of Investors Bancorp (no more
than two) to attend any meeting of its Board of Directors or the Executive

Investors Bancorp representative to remain present during any
confidential discussion of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby or any third party proposal to acquire control of Roma Financial or
during any other matter that the respective Board of Directors has reasonably
determined to be confidential with respect to Investors Bancorps

under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

statements and reports that it sends to its shareholders, or files with any

50 _Section 6.07 Employee Benefits. _

 

(a) Investors Bancorp will review all Roma Financial Compensation and Benefit
Plans to determine whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans.
Employees who are employed by Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary as of, and
immediately prior to, the Effective Time shall become employees of Investors
Bancorp and Investors Bank upon, and immediately following, the Effective
Time, provided however that this shall not be construed to limit the ability
of Investors Bancorp or Investors Bank to terminate the employment of any such
employee. In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as currently
provided by Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary are changed or terminated
by Investors Bancorp, in whole or in part, Investors Bancorp shall provide
former employees of Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary who become employees
of Investors Bancorp (or any Investors Bancorp Subsidiary) after the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") with compensation and benefits that
are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the compensation and benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Investors Bancorp or applicable
Investors Bancorp Subsidiary (as of the date any such compensation or benefit
is provided). Except as specifically set forth herein, Employees of Roma
Financial or any Roma Subsidiary who become participants in an Investors
Bancorp Compensation and Benefit Plan shall, for purposes of determining
eligibility for and for any applicable vesting periods of such employee
benefits only (and not for benefit accrual purposes) be given credit for
meeting eligibility and vesting requirements in such plans for service as an
employee of Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary or any predecessor thereto
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that credit for prior service
shall be given under the Investors Bancorp ESOP and the Investors Defined
Benefit Plan only for purposes of determining eligibility to participate in
such plans and not for vesting purposes, and provided further, that credit for
benefit accrual purposes will be given only for purposes of Investors Bancorp
vacation policies or programs and for purposes of the calculation of severance
benefits under any severance compensation plan of Investors Bancorp. This
Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Investors Bancorp or
Investors Bank to review employee benefits programs from time to time and to
make such changes (including terminating any program) as they deem
appropriate.

(b) Investors Bancorp shall honor the terms of all employment, consulting and
change in control agreements, if any, Previously Disclosed by Roma Financial,
subject to regulatory limitations. Each person named in Investors Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule 6.07(b) who is a party to an employment, severance or
change in control agreement with Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary (the
"Roma Employment Agreements") and who has been offered continued employment
with Investors Bank after the Effective Time, will be offered an agreement
with Investors Bank, the terms of which are set forth in Investors Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule 6.07(b), in replacement of his or her Roma Employment
Agreement, to be effective as of the Effective Time, subject to any required
regulatory approvals. Roma Financial has Previously Disclosed the payments and
benefits that would be made/provided under the Roma Employment
Agreements, assuming a change in control and a termination of employment had
occurred as of December 31, 2012.

(c) Except as provided in Section 6.07(b), nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed to grant a contract of employment to any
Continuing Employee. Any employee of Roma Financial or Roma Subsidiary, other
than an employee who is a party to an employment agreement, change in control
agreement or other separation agreement that provides a benefit on a
termination of employment, whose employment is terminated involuntarily (other
than for cause) within one year following the Bank Merger Effective Date
shall receive a lump sum severance payment from Investors Bank equal to two
weeks pay at the rate then in effect, for each full year of employment with
Roma Financial (or the applicable Roma Subsidiary) with a minimum
severance payment of four weeks and up to a maximum of 26 weeks, provided
that such employee enters into a release of claims against the Roma Parties
and the Investors Parties, their Subsidiaries and affiliates in a form
satisfactory to Investors Bancorp. Such employees of Roma Financial or Roma
Subsidiary will have the right to continued health coverage under group health
plans of Investors Bank in accordance with IRC Section 4980B(f) and ERISA
Sections 601-609.

 

(d) The Roma 401(k) Plans shall be terminated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In connection with the termination of the Roma 401(k) Plans,
Roma Bank (including any Subsidiary), or Investors Bank following

 



51  the Effective Time, shall use their best efforts to seek a favorable
determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Roma 401(k) Plans.
As soon as administratively practicable following the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Roma 401(k) Plans,
the account balances of all participants and beneficiaries in the Roma 401(k)
Plans shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or
transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct in accordance
with the requirements of the IRC and ERISA.

 

(e) The Roma Bank ESOP shall be terminated immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "ESOP Termination Date"). Roma Bank shall continue to accrue and
make contributions to such Roma Bank ESOP for the plan year ending as of the
ESOP Termination Date in accordance with the ESOP share acquisition loan
amortization schedule in effect as of the date of this Agreement. In no event
later than three business days prior to the Effective Time, a sufficient
number of unallocated shares held as collateral pursuant to the Roma Bank ESOP
shall be used to repay the outstanding ESOP share acquisition loan, and
immediately thereafter Roma Financial will take all necessary actions to
extinguish the remaining ESOP share acquisition loan. The Roma Bank ESOP shall
terminate in accordance with its terms and all plan assets (with the exception
of the unallocated shares that are used to repay the outstanding ESOP share
acquisition loan) shall be allocated for the benefit of such plan participants
as of the ESOP Termination Date. Not later than the Effective Time, all
remaining shares of Roma Financial Common Stock held by the Roma Bank ESOP as
of the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. In connection with the termination of the Roma Bank ESOP, Roma
Bank, or Investors Bank following the Effective Time, shall use their best
efforts to seek a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the
termination of the Roma Bank ESOP. As soon as administratively practicable
following the receipt of a favorable determination letter on the termination
of the Roma Bank ESOP, the account balances in the ESOP shall be either
distributed to the participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct, in accordance with the requirements of
the IRC and ERISA.

(f) In the event of any termination or consolidation of any Roma Financial
health plan with any Investors Bancorp health plan, Investors Bancorp shall
make available to Continuing Employees and their dependents employer-provided
health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Investors
Bancorp employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates
coverage under an Roma Financial health plan prior to the time that such
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Investors Bancorp
health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the Roma Financial health plans prior
to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all
employees of Investors Bancorp and their dependents. In the event of a
termination or consolidation of any Roma Financial health plan, terminated
Roma Financial employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage under group health plans of Investors Bancorp in
accordance with COBRA, consistent with the provisions below. All Roma
Financial employees who cease participating in a Roma Financial health plan
and become participants in a comparable Investors Bancorp health plan (each a
"Former Roma Financial Health Plan Participant") shall receive credit for any
co-payment and deductibles paid under Roma Financials health plan for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the Investors Bancorp health plan, upon substantiation, in
a form satisfactory to Investors Bancorp that such co-payment and/or
deductible has been satisfied. With respect to any Former Roma
Financial Health Plan Participant, any coverage limitation under the
Investors Bancorp health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be
waived by the Investors Bancorp health plan to the degree that such condition
was covered by the Roma Financial health plan and such condition would
otherwise have been covered by the Investors Bancorp health plan in the
absence of such coverage limitation.

(g) Roma Financial has Previously Disclosed each individual ("Participant")
who has entered into a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreement and/or
a Phantom Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement with Roma Financial or any Roma
Subsidiary (collectively, the "Non-Qualified Agreements") and the amount of
their project accrued benefits thereunder as of December 31, 2012. Investors
Bancorp shall on the Effective Time (i) take such actions as permitted to
irrevocably terminate each Non-Qualified Agreement; and (ii) subject

 



52  to the execution of a release of claims against the Investors Parties, their
Subsidiaries and affiliates in a form satisfactory to Investors Bancorp with
respect to the Participants contractual rights under his or her Non-
Qualified Agreement, distribute to each Participant in accordance with the
terms of the Non-Qualified Agreement and Section 409A of the IRC, a lump sum
cash amount equal to the liquidation value of such Participants accrued
benefit. The liquidation value of each Participants accrued benefit under his
or her Non-Qualified Agreement to be paid at the Effective Time shall be
determined by Roma Financial and approved by Investors Bancorp by no later
than five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate
payments or benefits to be made under any Roma Financial Compensation and
Benefit Plan that constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the IRC), and to the extent any payments or benefits would
constitute a "parachute payment," such payments and/or benefits will be
reduced to the extent necessary to avoid penalties under Section 280G of the
IRC.

 

(i) The Investors Parties agree that the completion of the Mergers will
constitute a "Change in Control" with respect to the Roma Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plans.

(j) Investors Bancorp, Investors Bank, Roma Financial and Roma Bank agree
to jointly establish a retention bonus pool to be paid to certain designated
Continuing Employees, with such recipients, amount of payments and timing of
payments to be agreed to in writing by the parties no later than 30 days
following the date of this Agreement. Such payments shall be made to the
applicable individuals if they are still employed by one of the parties upon
their designated "work through" date as set forth in the written retention
bonus pool agreement. The parties reserve the right to amend the retention
bonus pool agreement from time to time, by a mutual written agreement.

 

 _Section 6.08 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Investors Bancorp
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has
been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective
Time, an officer or director of Roma Financial or any Roma Subsidiary (the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of
Investors Bancorp, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole
or in part or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is
or was a director, officer or employee of Roma Financial or a Roma Subsidiary
if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at
or before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim
is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent as would have been permitted by Roma Financial under the applicable
Regulations and under Roma Financials Charter and Bylaws. Investors Bancorp
shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent as would have been
permitted by Roma Financial under applicable Regulations and under Roma
Financials Charter and Bylaws, upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
advance payments if he shall be adjudicated or determined to be not
entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.08 upon learning
of any Claim, shall notify Investors Bancorp (but the failure to so notify
Investors Bancorp shall not relieve Investors Bancorp from any liability
which it may have under this Section 6.08, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices Investors Bancorp) and shall deliver to Investors
Bancorp the undertaking referred to in the previous section. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) Investors Bancorp, or an insurance
carrier pursuant to Section 6.08(c) below, shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and Investors Bancorp shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified 

 



53  Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Investors
Bancorp elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Investors Bancorp and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to Investors Bancorp,
unless the Indemnified Party is provided with counsel by an insurance carrier
pursuant to Section 6.08(c) below, and Investors Bancorp shall pay, promptly
as statements therefore are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in

with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to its subject matter.
There are no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court

use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes
and intents of this Agreement.

 

 _Section 11.09 Governing Law. _

This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law
principles thereof, except to the extent that Federal law applies. Each of
the Parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of the Delaware Court of Chancery, New Castle County, or if that court does
not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims
in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court, and (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any Party hereto
may make service on another Party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided
for the giving of notices in Section 11.04. Nothing in this Section 11.09,
however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law. EACH OF THE INVESTORS PARTIES AND THE ROMA
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)

HEREBY.

otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section. The table of contents, index and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The phrases "the date of this
Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the
Recitals to this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 _Section 11.11 Specific Performance; Jurisdiction. _

 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall
be entitled to seek (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party agrees
that it will not seek and will agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other Partys seeking or
obtaining such injunctive relief.
