ARTICLE II    

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_     

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_     

2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:    

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company except, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such Shares held on behalf of
third parties, and (iii) Dissenting Shares (each Share referred to in clauses
(i) and (ii) being a " _Cancelled Share_ " and collectively, " _Cancelled
Shares_ " and each Share referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) being an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted automatically into and thereafter shall represent the right
to receive in cash an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any
withholding taxes as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_. At the Effective Time,
all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing any Share (other
than any Excluded Share) (a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share, without
interest, and each certificate formerly representing Dissenting Shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment to which reference
is made in _Section 2.1(d)_.    

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.    

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares
so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.    

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of
such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to demand and who have
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each such Dissenting Share, but instead holders of
such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, each such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for
payment of the Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting Shares. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals
of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or settle, or offer to agree to settle, any such
demands.    

(e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.   

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.    

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited to a paying agent which is a U.S. bank or trust company
that shall be appointed by Parent with the Companys prior written approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, to
act as a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the
benefit of holders of the Shares (and Restricted Shares), cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange
for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than the Cancelled Shares) and (ii) the Restricted Shares
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (such cash deposited
with the Paying Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the
Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
of issuers organized under the laws of a state of the United States of
America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from
any investment of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent.    

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly, but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders
of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) or in
the case of Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree, and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section 2.2(e)_) or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented
by such Certificate or book-entry (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration,
and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be issued to
such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares or Book-
Entry Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.    

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.    

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this  _Article
II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration per Share (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws).    

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings)
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.    

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on
behalf of itself (or any of their Subsidiaries that are withholding agents in
respect of compensatory payments), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (whether
pursuant to the Merger or otherwise) to any holder of Shares (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) such amounts that are required to
be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules, and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law (other than any deduction or withholding under Sections 897 or 1445 of
the Code if the Company provides Parent with the certificate described in 
_Section 5.1(e)_ and the proof described in _Section 4.18_ on or before the
Closing Date). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts ( _i_ ) shall be remitted by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and ( _ii_ ) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be.   

2.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.    

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each award of
restricted Class A Common Stock granted under the Companys 2004 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the Companys 2004 Unit Incentive Sub-Plan (collectively,
the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") (each outstanding restricted stock award, a "
_Restricted Share_ ") shall no longer be subject to vesting, performance,
forfeiture or other restriction provisions imposed on such Restricted Shares
by their terms immediately prior to the Effective Time, and be converted
automatically, by virtue of the Merger, into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Restricted Shares
Consideration_ "), except, subject to prior written notice to the Company on
or prior to the Effective Time, as otherwise agreed between Parent and the
holder of a Restricted Share.    

(b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in taking all commercially reasonable efforts
necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.3(a)_
(without expenditure of funds).   

ARTICLE III    

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_     

3.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
(i) the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") or (ii) the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as set forth in this _Section 3.1_. Any item disclosed in a section of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed in any other section of
the Company Disclosure Letter to which the relevance of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face.    

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to
the extent such concept is applicable) in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing, is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent or its Affiliates a complete and correct
copy of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, each as amended
to date.  _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter accurately and
completely lists each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are
organized and qualified to do business.    

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, of which 29,260,030 shares
of Class A Common Stock were outstanding as of the close of business on May
23, 2007, of which (x) 13,350,911 shares of Class A Common Stock are part of
IDSs and (2) 238,843 are Restricted Shares, (ii) 100,000,000 shares of Class
B Common Stock of which 23,374,450 shares of Class B Common Stock were
outstanding as of the close of business on May 23, 2007; and (iii) 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which no shares were
outstanding as of the date hereof. As of the close of business on May 23,
2007, no shares of Class A Common Stock and no shares of Class B Common Stock
were held in Treasury or by Subsidiaries of the Company. As of May 23, 2007,
the Company had 13,350,911 IDSs issued and outstanding consisting of
13,350,911 shares of Class A Common Stock and $81,974,593.54 aggregate
principal amount of Notes. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company
has no shares reserved for issuance other than, as of May 23, 2007, (A)
13,350,911 shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance in connection
with separation or recombination of IDSs and (B) 2,597,886 shares of Class A
Common Stock reserved for issuance by the Company Board of Directors pursuant
to Company Stock Plans. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter accurately and completely lists, as of the date specified therein,
each outstanding Restricted Share, including the holder, date of grant and
number of such Restricted Shares. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim or other
encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "). Except pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
and as provided in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter, other than
any shares of Class A Common Stock which are part of IDSs.    

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval; Fairness and Vote Required_. (i) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders
meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Company Stockholders
Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and, to general equity principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").   

(ii) As of the date hereof, the Company Board of Directors, at a duly called
and held meeting, has unanimously adopted resolutions: (A) determining that
the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fair and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declaring it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (B)
approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;
(C) recommending that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Recommendation_ ")
and directing that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted
for consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting;
(D) rendering the limitations on business combinations contained in Section
203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (E) receiving the opinion
of its financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin, to the effect
that as of the date of such opinion the Merger Consideration is fair from a
financial point of view to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock
(other than members of the Companys management that will retain or acquire
an equity interest in the Company, GTCR  CLC, LLC and their
respective Affiliates, Parent and its Subsidiaries and any other Person
excluded by Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin from such opinion), a copy of which
opinion has been delivered to Parent. It is agreed and understood that such
opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board of Directors and may not
be relied on by Parent or its Affiliates. The Company Board of Directors has
taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested stockholder" or
prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL)
under Section 203 of the DGCL or any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover laws and regulations (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") of any
jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated
hereby and thereby. Except for the Company Stockholders Approval and the
filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   

(iii) The holders of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
will vote together as a single class for purposes of the Company Stockholders
Approval, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of such
single class will be sufficient for the adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger pursuant to such Company Stockholders Approval. For purposes of
the Company Stockholders Approval, (A) each share of Class A Common Stock is
entitled to one (1) vote; and (B) each share of Class B Common Stock is
entitled to two (2) votes.

be made by the Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits or authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any
domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission,
body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity,
including, but not limited to, any exchange on which securities of the
Company are traded or listed (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   

(ii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, assuming compliance with the matters referenced in _Section
3.1(d)(i)_, receipt of the Company Approvals and the receipt of the Company
Stockholders Approval, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and performance of this Agreement by the Company, including
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default
under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the
comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries or, (B) with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,

employment of employees, including but not limited to laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, classification of employees, equal employment entitlements,
prohibited discrimination and unfair labor practices, except as would not
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has previously made available to Parent or its Affiliates correct and

of all Registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company, indicating for

of the Company and its Subsidiaries and as are in accordance with normal
industry practice for companies engaged in businesses similar to that of the

action described in clauses (A), (B) or (C) above until at least the
sixth (6th) Business Day after the provision of notice to Parent required
hereby and (y) notify Parent promptly if its intention to take such action
referred to in its notification shall change at any time after giving such

In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise, the Company Board of Directors shall take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent or
any other information provided by Parent in response to such notice.    

(c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder or otherwise prohibit the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose is likely to be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law.    

(d) _Existing Discussions_. Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section
4.2_, the Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The

individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 4.2_ and in the Confidentiality
Agreement.   

4.3. _Information Supplied_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees, as to it
and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied by it or any of
its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

Agreement, including _Section 4.2_, the Company acting through the Company
Board of Directors shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give

except where there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 4.2(b)_, use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if the Company Board of Directors has
approved, endorsed or recommended a Superior Proposal, or has
withdrawn, modified or amended the Recommendation in accordance with _Section
4.2_ in a manner adverse to Parent or resolves to do any of the foregoing,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (x) the
Company shall not be obligated to call, give notice of, convene and hold (and
may cancel) the Company Meeting and (y) the Company shall not be required
to take any of the other actions set forth in _Section 4.5_.

further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should
be discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company
to the stockholders of the Company.

applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable.   

(c) _Information_. Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy

another in connection with the preparation of their respective Notification

when due by the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand.   

(iii) Each party hereto shall use its best efforts (which shall include
litigation) to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law. In the context of this _Section 4.5(d)(iii)_, "best efforts"
shall include, without limitation, the following:

(60) days following the date of its receipt thereof;    

(B) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly respond to any request from
the other for information or documentation reasonably requested by the other
party in connection with the development and implementation of a strategy and
negotiating positions with any Antitrust Authorities; _provided_ that access
to any such filing, information or documentation will, at such partys
request be restricted to such other parties outside counsel and economists

material communication made to, or received by such party from, any Antitrust
Authority or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions

conditions, if any, specified or imposed by any Antitrust Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws as a requirement for granting any necessary
clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period, including agreeing to
hold separate, divest, license or cause a third party to purchase, assets
and/or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of its Affiliates, it
being understood that Parent shall be permitted to negotiate in good faith
with the Antitrust Authorities;    

(E) In the event any Antitrust Authority initiates a proceeding before any
court, commission, quasi-judicial or administrative agency of any federal,
state, local, or foreign jurisdiction seeking to restrain, enjoin or prohibit
the Merger, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent
the entry of any order restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the Merger,
including by retaining all appropriate expert witnesses and consultants. The
Company shall be permitted to participate in all aspects of the defense
of such proceedings and Parent shall use its best efforts to prevail in such
proceedings. Parent shall be responsible for the payment of its own expenses,
including legal fees and expenses, in seeking to prevent the entry of any
such order.    

(F) Parent shall not unilaterally withdraw its Notification and Report Form
without the consent of the Company and the Company agrees that such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that Parent withdraws its
Notification and Report Form, the parties agree that the applicable
Notification and Report Form shall be re-filed within two (2) Business Days
of the date such Form is withdrawn.   

(e) Parent and Merger Sub shall, jointly and severally, be responsible for the
payment of the Companys reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with obtaining the approval of any Antitrust Authority (other than
in connection with the initial filing), including legal fees and expenses, in
substantially complying with any formal request for additional information or
documentary material from any Antitrust Authority and in connection with
any litigation.   

(f) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other

notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the other of any change, fact or condition of which it has
knowledge that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or Parent Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to
Parents obligations to effect the Merger. Neither the Company nor Parent
shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.   

4.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Termination Date, to
its officers, employees, properties, Tax Returns, books, contracts and
records and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure,
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) to violate any Laws. All requests for information and

the Confidentiality Agreement.   

4.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release. Thereafter, each of the Company and Parent shall consult
with each other and obtain the consent of both the Company and Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including
any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with
respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange,
the American Stock Exchange or by the request of any Governmental
Entity.   

4.8. _Employee Benefits and Compensation_.   

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, pay, perform and
satisfy any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or in
respect of, each current and former employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") arising under the terms of any
Benefit Plan listed on  _Section 3.1(h)(i)_ to the Company Disclosure Letter
to which it is a party in accordance with the terms as in effect immediately
before the Closing Date; _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the amendment or termination of any such Benefit Plans,
employment, consulting, retention, severance, change-of-control or similar
agreement in accordance with their terms and applicable Law. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any
current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to
restrict the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate any
such employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
4.8(a)_, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan, or (ii)
shall limit the right or Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan
following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge
and agree that all provisions contained in this  _Section 4.8(a)_ with
respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the
sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing herein,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights (i) in any other person, including, without limitation, any current or
former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant
in any Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to
continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Affiliates or continued participation in any Benefit Plan.   

(b) Following the Closing Date, (i) Parent shall ensure that no waiting
periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing
conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work
exclusions are applicable to any Company Employees or their dependents
or beneficiaries under any Parent welfare benefit plans in which such
employees may be eligible to participate to the extent such exclusions or
limitations were applicable under the analogous Benefit Plan; and (ii) Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred by
Company Employees (and its dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and including)
the Closing Date shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deducible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket
provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any such
welfare benefit plans to the extent credit for such loss and expense
was taken under the analogous Benefit Plan.   

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including,
without limitation, severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or
practices, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which
Company Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date,
Parent shall grant, or cause to be granted to, all Company Employees from and
after the Closing Date credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective predecessors, prior to the Closing
Date for all purposes (including, without limitation, eligibility to
participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence benefits, early
retirement subsidies and severance, but excluding benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan or eligibility for post-retirement health or
welfare benefits) to the extent such service was taken into account for a
similar Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participates.   

4.9. _Expenses_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.9_ and 
_Sections 2.1, 4.5(d)(ii), 4.5(e), 4.8(a), 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.17, 6.5 and
7.10_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
Equity Commitment Letters, and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring or required to incur such expenses, except that expenses incurred
in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement
(including applicable SEC filing fees) and all fees paid in respect of
any regulatory filings shall be borne one half by Parent and Merger Sub,
jointly and severally, and one half by the Company.   

(b) All Separation Fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid in full by the Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally.   

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.9_, all expenses of the
Company incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and

contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid in full by the Company on or
prior to Closing.   

4.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-
laws or similar organization documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current
or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Costs pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition or resolution of such Costs. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section 4.10_.   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, jointly and severally, shall also advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, including amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, that are, in whole or in
part, based on or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the
Equity Commitment Letters or serve or served as a fiduciary under, or with
respect to, any employee benefit plan at any time maintained by or
contributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
4.10(b)_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after
statements therefor are received and otherwise advanced to such Indemnified
Party upon request of reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably
incurred; _provided_ , that each Indemnified Party shall repay such amounts
(with such repayment obligation to be unsecured and non-interest bearing) if
and to the extent that it shall ultimately be determined in a decision by a
court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be taken that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for such fees and expenses, (ii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the defense of such matter and
(iii) any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation or by-laws shall be made
by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified
Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
If such indemnity is not available with respect to any Indemnified Party,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party
shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion is appropriate to
reflect relative faults and benefits.   

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall either maintain the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_"), or Parent shall provide
for equivalent directors and officers liability insurance covering the
individuals who are covered by the DandO Insurance on the date hereof
and providing benefits and levels of coverage that are no less favorable than
those provided under the DandO Insurance, with respect to acts or omissions
prior to the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in
excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof (the " _Current Premium_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the existing DandO Insurance or such insurance provided by Parent expires, is
terminated or cancelled or is otherwise unavailable on such terms during such
six (6) year period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance with the best terms
available as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium
not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 250% of the Current Premium.   

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
4.10_.   

(f) The provisions of this _Section 4.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
beneficiaries of the DandO insurance, their heirs and their representatives. If
any Indemnified Party or DandO Insurance beneficiary is required to bring any
action to enforce rights or to collect monies due under this Agreement and
is successful in such action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with bringing and pursuing such action, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs.   

(g) The rights of each Indemnified Party and DandO Insurance beneficiaries
hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights
such Indemnified Party or beneficiary may have under the certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification or insurance arrangement, the DGCL, other contract or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 4.10_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and DandO Insurance
beneficiaries.   

4.11. _Financing_. (a) The Company shall and shall use good faith efforts to
cause its independent auditors, counsel and other representatives to provide
all reasonable and timely cooperation in connection with the arrangement of

form and content to allow compliance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the requirements of the rules
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of a type and in the form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities
Act and regulations promulgated thereunder to consummate any portion of the
Debt Financing (and including, with respect to any audited financial
statements, the report of the Companys auditors thereon) (the " _Required
Financial Information_ "), (iv) reasonably cooperating with Parent and
Merger Sub and their financing sources (including by participating in
drafting sessions) in the preparation of (A) any and all offering,

_Offering Documents_ "), including but not limited to using commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that an offering memorandum prepared in
accordance with customary practices for any offering under Rule 144A with
respect to any financing that Parent and Merger Sub are seeking to obtain is
prepared in a timely manner in connection with such financing, including by

contemplated hereby, in each case subject to customary assumptions and
qualifications, as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub and
reasonably acceptable to the Company and (ix) taking all corporate
actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing
and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Company at or
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that, all such information to be provided
by the Company pursuant to this _Section 4.11_ pursuant to a request made by
Parent in a timely manner (but in any event no later than thirty (30) Business
Days prior to the Closing) in accordance with the terms of this _Section

_further_ , that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth
herein, (1) in no event shall the Company be required to pay any commitment

the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries,
or any applicable Laws; and (3) the parties hereto agree to act in good faith

business or operations.   

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing and the equity financing pursuant to the respective Financing
Commitments. Parent shall not without the prior written approval of the
Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification, waiver or remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing at the Closing or materially and adversely amends the
conditions to the drawdown of the Debt Financing; provided, however,
that Parent may, without the prior written approval of the Company, permit
the reduction of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing if Parent also
obtains from alternative sources commitments in the aggregate amount of at
least such reduction with terms and conditions that will not, taken as a
whole, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, result in a decrease in the
likelihood that such commitments from alternative sources will be available
on the Closing Date.   

4.12. _Debt Tender Offer/Redemption of Notes_.   

(a) Following the date hereof, the Company shall commence promptly, after
receipt of a written request from Parent to do so and receipt of the Debt
Tender Offer Documents (as defined below) from Parent, a consent solicitation
and/or an offer to purchase and related consent solicitation, or one or both
of them, on such terms and conditions requested by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (either or both such actions are referred to
collectively as the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") with respect to all of the
Notes, issued pursuant to the Indenture. The Company shall provide, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer, including entering into
customary dealer manager and consent solicitation agreements (in each case as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) in connection with the Debt
Tender Offer; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary set forth herein, (i) in no event shall the Company be required to
pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any cost, expense, liability or
other obligations in connection with the Debt Tender Offer prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company, in its sole
discretion, pays or incurs any reasonable cost, expense, liability or
other obligations in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall be promptly (and in any event no later than
three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of invoices with respect
to such cost, expense, liability and other obligations) reimbursed by
Parent or Merger Sub for such costs, expenses, liabilities or other
obligations; (ii) such cooperation, in the good faith determination of the
Company, after consultation with counsel, would not reasonably be likely to
consist of or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, any
Contract in effect as of the date hereof (including any financing
arrangements), the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or
the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or any
applicable Laws; and (iii) the parties hereto agree to act in good faith
to cooperate hereunder in such a manner so as to avoid any material
interference with the normal conduct of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business or operations.   

(b) The Companys obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Notes
tendered pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer or make any payment for consents
shall be subject to conditions as requested by Parent in writing and
reasonably acceptable to the Company, including that (i) the closing of the
Debt Tender Offer shall occur concurrently with the Effective Time (or Parent
and the Company shall be satisfied that it will occur substantially
concurrently with such acceptance and payment), and (ii) such other
conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Debt Tender
Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the closing of the
Debt Tender Offer be a condition to the consummation of the Merger. Subject
to the proviso of the preceding sentence, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to close substantially
concurrently with the Effective Time. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to
provide, or cause to be provided to, the Company, immediately available funds
for the full payment (including any applicable premiums or consent
solicitation fees, and all related fees and expenses) at the Effective Time
(or if later at the expiration date of the Debt Tender Offer) of all
Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn (or consents received and not
withdrawn) to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender
Offer. The Debt Tender Offer and other actions taken in connection therewith
shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable
Laws.   

(c) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offer as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing (other than the conditions
that the Debt Tender Offer is conditioned on the Effective Time as provided
in clause (b) above and that there shall be no Law prohibiting consummation
of the Debt Tender Offer), so long as such waivers would not cause the Debt
Tender Offer to violate the Indenture, Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended (the " _TIA_ "), or any other applicable Law, and shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the
Debt Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms
and conditions of the Debt Tender Offer (including any extension
thereof) other than as agreed between Parent and the Company in writing or as
required to comply with applicable Law.   

(d) Parent shall prepare, in consultation with the Company, as promptly as
practicable, a consent statement and/or an offer to purchase and consent
statement in respect of the applicable Debt Tender Offer, together with any
required related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary agreements
(such documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the " _Debt Tender Offer Documents_ ").
Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Debt Tender Offer Documents. The Debt Tender Offer
Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to
the beneficial owners of the Notes in connection with the Debt Tender Offer
shall be subject to the prior review and, and comment by, Parent and the
Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be disseminated to the
record holders of the Notes, and to the extent known by the Company, the
beneficial owners of the Notes (collectively, the " _Noteholders_ ") the Debt
Tender Offer Documents. If at any time prior to the acceptance of Notes
pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer any event should occur that is required by
applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Debt Tender Offer Documents, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and disseminate such amendment or supplement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to such dissemination, the Company shall provide
copies thereof to Parent not less than three (3) Business Days (or such
shorter period of time as the Company reasonably believes is necessary in
light of the circumstances) in advance of any such dissemination and shall
consult with Parent with respect to such amendment or supplement, and shall
include in such amendment or supplement all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent to the extent consistent with applicable Law. The Company shall comply
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the TIA, and any other
applicable Law in connection with the Debt Tender Offer and such compliance
shall not constitute a breach hereunder or under the Debt Tender Offer
Documents.   

(e) Promptly following the expiration date of any consent solicitation under
the Debt Tender Offer, assuming the requisite consents from Noteholders
(including from persons holding proxies from the Noteholders) have been
received, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause an
appropriate supplemental indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") to
become effective concurrently with the Effective Time, and providing for the
amendments of the Indenture contemplated in the Debt Tender Offer Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the proposed amendments set forth therein shall
not become operative unless and until all conditions to the Debt Tender Offer
have been satisfied or waived by the Company in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof and the Company accepts all Notes (and related
consents) validly tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the Debt
Tender Offer and not withdrawn, and that, in any event, the parties agree
that the Supplemental Indenture shall not become operative, and no payment
or liability shall be incurred by the Company, before the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall the effectiveness of the
Supplemental Indenture be a condition to the consummation of the Merger. The
form and substance of the Supplemental Indenture shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company.   

(f) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VI_, Parent shall
promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses, printing
costs, and the out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of any dealer manager,
information agent, depositary or the other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Tender Offer) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the Debt Tender Offer. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, directors
and representatives and each Person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act for any loss or
liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by
them to the extent pursuant to this _Section 4.12_ with respect to the Debt
Tender Offer (other than as a result of the Companys fraud, gross negligence
or bad faith); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have
any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such Person to the extent
such damages are attributable to information made in the Debt Tender Offer
Documents based on information supplied by the Company or its Affiliates in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein that
is finally judicially determined to have contained a material misstatement or
material omission.   

4.13. _Other Actions by the Company_.   

(a) _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the
Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement, the
Company Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and by the Merger
and the Voting Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.   

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. The Company Board of Directors shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt
from Section 16 of the Exchange Act the conversion of all Shares (including
Restricted Shares) to cash pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide to counsel
for Parent for its review copies of such resolutions to be adopted by the
Company Board of Directors prior to such adoption.   

4.14. _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys hereto
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties hereto understand and
agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of
its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.   

4.15. _No Additional Representations_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
each of them and their Affiliates and Representatives have received access to
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of
the Company which each of them and their Affiliates and Representatives have
deemed necessary or requested to review, and that each of them and their
Affiliates and Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the
Company and the management of the Company to discuss the financial condition,
business, operations, results of operations, properties, assets or
liabilities of the Company. Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company
furnished or made available to Parent and its officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Representative_ "),
except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ (which includes the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company Reports), and neither the Company, its
Affiliates and Representatives, nor any other Person shall be subject to any
liability to Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the
Companys making available to Parent or Parents Affiliates use of such
information, including the presentation materials delivered to Parent or its
Affiliates, as subsequently updated, supplemented or amended (the "
_Information Memorandum_ "), or any information, documents or material made
available to Parent or its Affiliates in the due diligence materials provided
to Parent or its Affiliates, including in the data room, other
management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty to
Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to (i) the information set forth
in the Information Memorandum or (ii) any financial projection or forecast
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included
in the Information Memorandum or any management presentation.   

4.16. _Equity Commitment Letters_. Parent shall not amend, modify, supplement
or terminate the Equity Commitment Letters and shall not waive any of the
terms thereof without the prior written consent of the Company.   

4.17. _Payment of Debt_. _(a)_ In the event that the Debt Tender Offer has
not been consummated in accordance with the terms of _Section 4.12_ prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall, (i) immediately prior to the Effective
Time issue a notice of redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Notes, pursuant to the terms of Article III of the
Indenture and Section 5 of the Notes, and (ii) take any other actions
reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge
of the Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions set forth
in Section 8.02 of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture
applicable thereto; _provided_ , that prior to the Companys being required to
take any of the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, Parent shall
have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the
Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the
Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the
"Discharge" of the Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to, cooperate in good faith as reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of the Notes; 
_provided_ , that any Opinion of Counsel (as such term is defined in the
Indenture) or any other opinions required to be provided in connection with
the Discharge of the Notes shall be provided by Parents counsel.    

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver or shall cause to deliver to Parent a statement showing all
outstanding principal of and accrued interest in respect of all Loans (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) and the Notes (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) and any other amounts owed by Coinmach Corporation, Coinmach
Laundry and each Subsidiary Guarantor (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
under the Credit Agreement (the " _Credit Agreement Amount_ ").
Contemporaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to (and the Surviving Corporation shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to), pay the Credit Agreement Amount and satisfy all
the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of Coinmach Corporation,
Coinmach Laundry and each Subsidiary Guarantor (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) under the Credit Agreement.   

4.18. _Notice of Non-USRPHC Certificate_. The Company shall furnish to Parent
on or before the Closing Date proof reasonably satisfactory to Parent that
the Company has provided notice of the certificate described in Section
5.1(e) to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2).   

4.19. _Confidentiality of Information and Materials_ From the date hereof to
the earlier of (i) the date that is two (2) years from the date of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VI_ and (ii) the
Closing, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause
their Representatives to: (a) treat and hold as confidential (and
not disclose or provide access to any Person to) all confidential and/or
proprietary information of, or furnished by, Parent (other than any such
information which (x) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
its Representatives in breach of this _Section 4.19_, (y) becomes available
to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Parent, provided that such source
is not, and was not, bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Parent, or
(z) was available to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives on
a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure of such information by Parent or
its Representatives) and, not otherwise use or disclose such information,
except in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than disclosure of the Debt Commitment Letters, the Equity Commitment
Letters or the terms of any financing related thereto (except as required by
the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act
regarding the solicitation of proxies)) or as otherwise expressly permitted
by Parent in writing, (b) in the event that the Company or any Subsidiary or
any such Representative is required by law, legal or regulatory process or
in connection with any audit or investigation by a Governmental Entity to
disclose any such information, provide the Parent with reasonable written
notice of such requirement so that the Parent may seek a protective order or
other remedy or waive compliance with this _Section 4.19_ , and (c) in the
event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or
the Parent waives compliance with this _Section 4.19_, furnish only that
portion of such confidential information which is legally required to be
provided and exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information. The Company agrees
and acknowledges that remedies at law for any breach of its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under this _Section 4.19_ are inadequate and that
in addition thereto the Parent shall be entitled to seek equitable relief,
including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any such
breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subclause (i) of this Section 4.19
will not apply to the Debt Commitment Letters or the Equity Commitment
letters.
