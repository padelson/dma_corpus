Stock underlying the units of IDS (as defined below), and (ii)&nbsp;class B common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Class&nbsp;B Common Stock</U>,&#148; and together with the Class&nbsp;A

conditions set forth herein;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that the Company shall survive the Merger as a wholly owned

covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE I

Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with

surviving corporation in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;). The Merger shall have
the effects specified in this Agreement and the DGCL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">1.2. <U>Closing</U>. The closing of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) shall take place
(i)&nbsp;at the offices of White &#038; Case LLP, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New&nbsp;York at
9:00&nbsp;A.M. on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;V</U> (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii)&nbsp;at such other
place and time or on such other date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the
&#147;<U>Closing Date</U>&#148;), provided that such Closing Date shall not be earlier than September&nbsp;28,
2007, unless Parent has notified the Company in writing that Parent and Merger Sub have and would
have as of an earlier date all necessary funds to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">1.3. <U>Effective Time</U>. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Company will cause a certificate of merger (the &#147;<U>Delaware Certificate of Merger</U>&#148;) to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with Section&nbsp;251 of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in
the Delaware Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger
being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">1.4. <U>The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation</U>. Subject to
<U>Section&nbsp;4.10</U>, at the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the

of incorporation of Merger Sub read immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be &#147;Coinmach Service Corp.&#148;, until thereafter changed, amended
or repealed as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law; <U>provided</U>, that the
Certificate of Incorporation shall include provisions substantially identical to Article&nbsp;VII of the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company immediately prior to the date
hereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that in no event shall such provisions of Article&nbsp;VII of
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company immediately prior to the date
hereof be amended prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, in a manner adverse
to the rights of the beneficiaries of such provisions of Article&nbsp;VII prior to the Effective Time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">1.5. <U>The By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation</U>. Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;4.10</U>, at
the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (&#147;<U>By-Laws</U>&#148;), until thereafter changed or amended
or repealed as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law, shall be amended so as to
read in their entirety as the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law, except that the references to
Merger Sub&#146;s name shall be replaced by references to &#147;Coinmach Service Corp.&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">1.6. <U>Directors</U>. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the

accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt">ARTICLE II



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;</U>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U>EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">2.1. <U>Effect on Capital Stock</U>. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any capital
stock of the Company:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(a) <U>Merger Consideration</U>. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i)&nbsp;Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, (ii)&nbsp;Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company except, in the case of clauses&nbsp;(i) and (ii), for any such Shares held on behalf of third
parties, and (iii)&nbsp;Dissenting Shares (each Share referred to in clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;being a
&#147;<U>Cancelled Share</U>&#148; and collectively, &#147;<U>Cancelled Shares</U>&#148; and each Share referred to
in clauses (i)&nbsp;through (iii)&nbsp;being an &#147;<U>Excluded Share</U>&#148; and collectively, &#147;<U>Excluded
Shares</U>&#148;)) shall be converted automatically into and thereafter shall represent the right to
receive in cash an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, less any withholding taxes as
provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(f)</U>. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly
representing any Share (other than any Excluded Share) (a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share, without interest, and
each certificate formerly representing Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the payment to which reference is made in <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(d)</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(b) <U>Cancellation of Shares</U>. Each Cancelled Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease
to exist.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(c) <U>Merger Sub</U>. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01&nbsp;per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one (1)&nbsp;validly issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(d) <U>Dissenters&#146; Rights</U>. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and
that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who are entitled to demand and who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with,
Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) will not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting Share, but instead holders of such
Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section&nbsp;262 unless and until any such holder
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, each such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting Shares. At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The
Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders&#146; rights of appraisal. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle, or offer to agree to settle, any such demands.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(e) <U>Adjustments</U>. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case,
normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; <U>provided</U> that nothing herein shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">2.2. <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(a) <U>Paying Agent</U>. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited to a paying agent which is a U.S.&nbsp;bank or trust company that shall be appointed by
Parent with the Company&#146;s prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, to act as a paying agent hereunder (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;),

sufficient to pay (i)&nbsp;the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares

Restricted Shares Consideration payable pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U> (such cash deposited with
the Paying Agent being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). The Paying Agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; <U>provided</U>, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the laws of a
state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody&#146;s Investors Service,

repurchase agreements or banker&#146;s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1
billion. Any interest and other income resulting from any investment of the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(a)</U> shall be promptly returned to Parent.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(b) <U>Exchange Procedures</U>. Promptly, but in any event within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>) or in the case of Shares represented by book-entry
(&#147;<U>Book-Entry Shares</U>&#148;), upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may agree, and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
<U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>) to the Paying Agent
in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided
in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(f)</U>) equal to (x)&nbsp;the number of Shares represented by such Certificate or
book-entry (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>) multiplied
by (y)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares or Book-Entry Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(c) <U>Transfers</U>. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is presented
to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>.

proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for
one (1)&nbsp;year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder
of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
<U>Article&nbsp;II</U> shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration per Share (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided
in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(f)</U>) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(e) <U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. In the event any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by
Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:1%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 7%">(f) <U>Withholding Rights</U>. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of
itself (or any of their Subsidiaries that are withholding agents in respect of compensatory
payments), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement (whether pursuant to the Merger or otherwise) to any holder of Shares
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares) such amounts that are required to be
deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), the rules, and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (other than any deduction or withholding under Sections
897 or 1445 of the Code if the Company provides Parent with the certificate described in
<U>Section&nbsp;5.1(e)</U> and the proof described in <U>Section&nbsp;4.18</U> on or before the Closing
Date). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts (<U>i</U>) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (<U>ii</U>) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

restricted stock award, a &#147;<U>Restricted Share</U>&#148;) shall no longer be subject to vesting,
performance, forfeiture or other restriction provisions imposed on such Restricted Shares by their

prior to the Closing) in accordance with the terms of this <U>Section&nbsp;4.11</U>, shall be provided
to Parent or Merger Sub (aa)&nbsp;in the case of Required Financial Information, at least twenty (20)
Business Days prior to Closing, and (bb)&nbsp;in the case of information other than Required Financial
Information, as soon as reasonably practicable; and <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth herein, (1)&nbsp;in no event shall the Company
be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any cost, expense, liability or other
obligations in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that if the Company, in its sole discretion, pays or incurs any reasonable cost,
expense, liability or other obligations in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall be promptly reimbursed (and in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days following receipt by Parent of invoices with respect to such cost, expense, liability
and other obligations) by Parent or Merger Sub for such costs, expenses, liabilities or other
obligations; (2)&nbsp;such cooperation, in the good faith determination of the Company, after
consultation with counsel, would not reasonably be likely to consist of or result in a breach or
violation of, or a default under, any Contract in effect as of the date hereof (including any
financing arrangements), the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the
comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws; and (3)&nbsp;the
parties hereto agree to act in good faith to cooperate hereunder in such a manner so as to avoid
any material interference with the normal conduct of the Company&#146;s or its Subsidiaries&#146; business or
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Debt Financing and the
equity financing pursuant to the respective Financing Commitments. Parent shall not without the
prior written approval of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or
remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing at the Closing or materially and
adversely amends the conditions to the drawdown of the Debt Financing; provided, however, that
Parent may, without the prior written approval of the Company, permit the reduction of the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing if Parent also obtains from alternative sources commitments
in the aggregate amount of at least such reduction with terms and conditions that will not, taken
as a whole, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, result in a decrease in the likelihood that such
commitments from alternative sources will be available on the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.12. <U>Debt Tender Offer/Redemption of Notes</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Following the date hereof, the Company shall commence promptly, after receipt of a written
request from Parent to do so and receipt of the Debt Tender Offer Documents (as defined below) from
Parent, a consent solicitation and/or an offer to purchase and related consent solicitation, or one
or both of them, on such terms and conditions requested by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (either or both such actions are referred to collectively as the &#147;<U>Debt Tender
Offer</U>&#148;) with respect to all of the Notes, issued pursuant to the Indenture. The Company shall
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer, including entering into customary dealer manager
and consent solicitation agreements (in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company)
in connection with the Debt Tender Offer; <U>provided</U>, that, notwithstanding any provision to

or similar fee or incur any cost, expense, liability or other obligations in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer prior to the Effective Time; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if the
Company, in its sole discretion, pays or incurs any reasonable cost, expense, liability or other

promptly (and in any event no later than three (3)&nbsp;Business Days following receipt by Parent of
invoices with respect to such cost, expense, liability and other obligations) reimbursed by Parent
or Merger Sub for such costs, expenses, liabilities or other obligations; (ii)&nbsp;such cooperation, in
the good faith determination of the Company, after consultation with counsel, would not reasonably
be likely to consist of or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, any Contract in
effect as of the date hereof (including any financing arrangements), the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws; and (iii)&nbsp;the parties hereto agree to act in good faith to
cooperate hereunder in such a manner so as to avoid any material interference with the normal
conduct of the Company&#146;s or its Subsidiaries&#146; business or operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The Company&#146;s obligation to accept for payment and pay for the Notes tendered pursuant to
the Debt Tender Offer or make any payment for consents shall be subject to conditions as requested
by Parent in writing and reasonably acceptable to the Company, including that (i)&nbsp;the closing of
the Debt Tender Offer shall occur concurrently with the Effective Time (or Parent and the Company
shall be satisfied that it will occur substantially concurrently with such acceptance and payment),
and (ii)&nbsp;such other conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Debt Tender Offer;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in no event shall the closing of the Debt Tender Offer be a
condition to the consummation of the Merger. Subject to the proviso of the preceding sentence, the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to close
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide,
or cause to be provided to, the Company, immediately available funds for the full payment
(including any applicable premiums or consent solicitation fees, and all related fees and expenses)
at the Effective Time (or if later at the expiration date of the Debt Tender Offer) of all Notes
properly tendered and not withdrawn (or consents received and not withdrawn) to the extent required
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer. The Debt Tender Offer and other actions taken in
connection therewith shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable Laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offer as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing (other than the conditions that the Debt Tender Offer is
conditioned on the Effective Time as provided in clause (b)&nbsp;above and that there shall be no Law
prohibiting consummation of the Debt Tender Offer), so long as such waivers would not cause the
Debt Tender Offer to violate the Indenture, Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the &#147;<U>TIA</U>&#148;), or any other applicable Law, and shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or
modification to the terms and conditions of the Debt Tender Offer (including any extension thereof)
other than as agreed between Parent and the Company in writing or as required to comply with
applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Parent shall prepare, in consultation with the Company, as promptly as practicable, a

Debt Tender Offer, together with any required related letters of transmittal and similar ancillary
agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to
herein collectively as the &#147;<U>Debt Tender Offer Documents</U>&#148;). Parent and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Debt Tender Offer Documents. The
Debt Tender Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the
beneficial owners of the Notes in connection with the Debt Tender Offer shall be subject to the
prior review and, and comment by, Parent and the Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to each
of them. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be disseminated to
the record holders of the Notes, and to the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners of
the Notes (collectively, the &#147;<U>Noteholders</U>&#148;) the Debt Tender Offer Documents. If at any
time prior to the acceptance of Notes pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer any event should occur that
is required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Debt
Tender Offer Documents, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
disseminate such amendment or supplement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that prior to such
dissemination, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less than three (3)&nbsp;Business
Days (or such shorter period of time as the Company reasonably believes is necessary in light of
the circumstances) in advance of any such dissemination and shall consult with Parent with respect
to such amendment or supplement, and shall include in such amendment or supplement all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent to the extent consistent with applicable Law. The Company shall
comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the TIA, and any other applicable Law
in connection with the Debt Tender Offer and such compliance shall not constitute a breach
hereunder or under the Debt Tender Offer Documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Promptly following the expiration date of any consent solicitation under the Debt Tender
Offer, assuming the requisite consents from Noteholders (including from persons holding proxies
from the Noteholders) have been received, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the &#147;<U>Supplemental Indenture</U>&#148;) to become
effective concurrently with the Effective Time, and providing for the amendments of the Indenture
contemplated in the Debt Tender Offer Documents; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
proposed amendments set forth therein shall not become operative unless and until all conditions to
the Debt Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived by the Company in accordance with the terms
hereof and thereof and the Company accepts all Notes (and related consents) validly tendered for
purchase and payment pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer and not withdrawn, and that, in any event,
the parties agree that the Supplemental Indenture shall not become operative, and no payment or
liability shall be incurred by the Company, before the Effective Time; <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, that in no event shall the effectiveness of the Supplemental Indenture be a
condition to the consummation of the Merger. The form and substance of the Supplemental Indenture
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U>, Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses, printing costs, and the out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or the other agent retained in connection with
the Debt Tender Offer) incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective
officers, directors and representatives and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of Section&nbsp;20 of the Exchange Act for any loss or liabilities incurred by any of them
in connection with any action taken by them to the extent pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;4.12</U>
with respect to the Debt Tender Offer (other than as a result of the Company&#146;s fraud, gross
negligence or bad faith); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent shall not have any
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such Person to the extent such damages are
attributable to information made in the Debt Tender Offer Documents based on information supplied
by the Company or its Affiliates in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein that is finally judicially determined to have contained a material misstatement
or material omission.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.13. <U>Other Actions by the Company</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Takeover Laws</U>. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Merger, the

contemplated by the Voting Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as

Shares (including Restricted Shares) to cash pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act. The Company shall provide to counsel for Parent for its review copies of such resolutions to
be adopted by the Company Board of Directors prior to such adoption.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.14. <U>Control of Operations</U>. Without in any way limiting any party&#146;s hereto rights or
obligations under this Agreement, the parties hereto understand and agree that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Company&#146;s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">4.15. <U>No Additional Representations</U>. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that each of

facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company which each of them and their
Affiliates and Representatives have deemed necessary or requested to review, and that each of them
and their Affiliates and Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the Company and the

any other Person resulting from the Company&#146;s making available to Parent or Parent&#146;s Affiliates use
of such information, including the presentation materials delivered to Parent or its Affiliates, as
subsequently updated, supplemented or amended (the &#147;<U>Information Memorandum</U>&#148;), or any
information, documents or material made available to Parent or its Affiliates in the due diligence
materials provided to Parent or its Affiliates, including in the data room, other management

set forth in the Information Memorandum or (ii)&nbsp;any financial projection or forecast relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included in the Information Memorandum or
