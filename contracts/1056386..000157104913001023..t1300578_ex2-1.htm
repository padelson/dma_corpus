being the "Accounting Firm") by way of a joint written submission notice (the
"Submission Notice") accompanied by a copy of the Dispute Notice.

  



  

(4) Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to deliver
its written decision with respect to the resolution of the Closing Statements
Dispute within thirty (30) days following the date of receipt of the
Submission Notice by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm's failure or
inability to respect such timing shall not invalidate its decision.

  



  

(5) The Accounting Firm will limit its review only to the specific
items or calculations indicated in the Dispute Notice (except to the extent
that IFRS requires adjustments to other items as a result thereof).

(6) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated
to the Parties as determined (and as set forth in the final determination) by
the Accounting Firm based upon the relative success (in terms of percentages)
of each Party's claims. For example, if the final determination reflects a
sixty-forty (60-40) compromise of the aggregate disputed amount set forth in
the Dispute Notice in favor of the Sellers' Representative, the Accounting
Firm would allocate expenses forty percent (40%) to the Sellers and sixty
percent (60%) to Buyer. Sellers shall be liable for fees and expenses owed by
the Sellers to the Accounting Firm in accordance with their Pro Rata Share.

  



  

(7) The Parties will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the
term of its engagement. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to
assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers' Representative, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer,
on the one hand, or Sellers' Representative, on the other hand. The Parties
shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination based
solely on presentations by Buyer and Sellers' Representative which are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement
(i.e., not on the basis of an independent review).

  



  

(8) No Party shall communicate with the Accounting Firm on the
subject matter of its review, except by joint conference call, joint
meeting or letter with copy simultaneously delivered to the other Parties;
provided that if a Party receives a request for such joint communication to
the Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 14.11 of the Agreement and
provides no response thereto within two (2) Business Days, then the Party
sending such request may communicate with the Accounting Firm independently.

  



  

(9) The resolution of the Closing Statements Dispute and the final
Purchase Price determined in accordance therewith will be final and binding
upon Buyer and Sellers, with no right of appeal or judicial review on any
grounds absent fraud or manifest error.

  



  

Section 2.9 Purchase Price Adjustments

  



  

(1) If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.7 or, if there is a Closing Statements Dispute, pursuant to Section 2.8, is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price (such difference, represented by a
positive number, being the "Over Payment"), then, within five (5) Business
Days following the Final Determination Date, Sellers' Representative and
Buyer shall give joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent:

  



  

(a) to release from the Escrow Adjustment, an amount equal to the
Over Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by Buyer;

(c) to release the remaining Escrow Adjustment, if any, to Sellers
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(2) If the Over Payment exceeds the Escrow Adjustment, and Buyer has
elected not to recover such amount from the Escrow Indemnification, then each
of the Sellers shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Final
Determination Date, make payment by wire transfer to Buyer in immediately
available funds to an account specified by Buyer of such Sellers' Pro Rata
Share of such excess.

  



  

(3) If the Purchase Price as finally determined is greater than the

Share; and

instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Adjustment to
CDPQ, Fondaction and Sellers' Representative (for and on behalf of the
Sellers (other than CDPQ and Fondaction)) in accordance with their respective

which amount Sellers' Representative may deduct an amount equal to the
expenses incurred by it with respect to the determination of the Closing
Statements.

interest at the Applicable Rate from its due date through the actual date of
payment.

other Parties may be allowed to take possession of such books and records.

  



  

(10) Buyer covenants that it will not, and it will not cause or permit
the Targets to take any action on or after the Closing, make any election or
deemed election or make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or
take any position on any Tax Return that results in any increased Tax
liability or reduction of any deduction, credit or loss carry-over of any such
entity in respect of any period ending on or before or which includes the
Closing Date, which action directly or indirectly results in the Sellers'
having an increased Tax liability (including any related interest and
penalties).

  



  

(11) Buyer shall take, and it shall cause the Targets to take, all
reasonable steps and give all reasonable assistance to avoid or mitigate any
Tax liability which may give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(12) Buyer shall cause the Corporation, and the Corporation hereby
undertakes, to elect pursuant to sub-section 110(1.1) of the ITA that
neither the Corporation nor any Person not dealing at Arm's Length with the
Corporation will deduct in computing its income for a taxation year any
amount in respect of a payment to or for the benefit of any employee on the
cancellation of the Options.

  



  

(13) During the period commencing immediately following the Closing
Time and ending six (6) months after the relevant Governmental
Authorities are no longer entitled to assess or reassess the Corporation, as
the case may be, in respect of the Tax in question, in the case of (A) and
(B) below, and on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, in the case of
(C) below, if the Targets receive a refund of Taxes in respect of a Pre
Closing Tax Period that has not been reflected in the Closing Working Capital
Statement (for greater certainty including (A) the GST/PST Receivables
classified as "Government Current" and "Government Non-current" components of
current assets on the Balance Sheet, (B) any property tax receivable resulting
from the contestation of the City of Montreal municipal valuation set forth
on the balance sheet and (C) research and development tax credits), then Buyer
shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of such receipt, pay an amount equal to such refund to the
Sellers' Representative for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with
their

  



    

25 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Pro Rata Share; provided, however, that Buyer shall be entitled to deduct
from the payment of the refund all costs, fees and reasonable expenses Buyer
incurs in connection with obtaining such Tax refund or the payment thereof.

  



  

(14) Buyer shall provide written notice of, and upon receipt of such
notice, the Sellers shall promptly remit to Buyer all amounts owed for (a)
all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Targets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period not included in the Closing Statements and (b) any and all Taxes of
any Person imposed on any of the Targets as a transferee or successor, by
Contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing.

  



  

(15) The Sellers hereby agree to indemnify each Buyer Indemnified
Party and to hold it harmless from and against, any Loss attributable to (a)
all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Targets for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, (b) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group of which the Targets (or any predecessor of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, and (c) any
and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Targets) imposed on the
Targets as a transferee or successor, by Contract or pursuant to any Law,
which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing.
In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of the Targets for the Pre-Closing Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Targets
for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period.

  



  

(16) All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements, if any, with
respect to or involving the Targets shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Corporation shall not
be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  



  

(17) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the
Sellers.

  



  

(18) Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Buyer shall not
be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to this Section 10.1 or a breach of Section 30 of Schedule 3.1 with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, unless, and only to the
extent that, such breach results in the Targets having to pay Taxes for such
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (including reimbursement of any
previous refunds) taking into account all available tax losses and tax
credits for all Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods.

  



  

Section 10.2 Directors' and Officers' Insurance

  



  

(1)   The Sellers and Buyer agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favour of the present and former directors and officers of the
Targets (each such present or former director or officer, an "Indemnified
DandO Party") as in effect as of the Closing Date will survive and will
continue in full force and effect and without modification, and Buyer will
cause the Targets to honour such rights of indemnification and indemnify in
favour of the Indemnified DandO Parties pursuant thereto, with respect to
actions or omissions of the Indemnified DandO Parties occurring prior to the
Closing Date, for a period of not less than the limitation period under
applicable Law.

  



  

(2)   Prior to the Closing Date, the Targets will purchase, and pay
the premium in full for, prepaid non-cancellable run-off directors' and
officers' liability insurance (the "Tail Coverage Policy") providing coverage
for the Indemnified DandO Parties for a period of up to six (6) years from
the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or
events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



    

26

(3)   In the event that Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so
that the successor or assignee of Buyer (as the case may be) assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 10.2.

  



  

(4)   The provisions of this Section 10.2 are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified DandO Party, his
or her heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and
(ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification that any such person may have under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.3 Maintenance and Access to Records

  



  

(1)   Buyer agrees that it will retain all Books and Records and any
other documents, information and files relating to the Targets delivered to
it by the Sellers and relating to any period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date. So
long as such Books and Records and such other documents information and files
are retained by Buyer, the Sellers or their authorized representatives shall
have reasonable access thereto.

(1)   Subject to Section 12.2 below:

  



  

(a) Each Seller agrees that if it fails to observe or perform any
covenant or obligation under this Agreement, or breaches any of its
representations and warranties under Article 4 or in the bring-down
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(4) (or if any of
such representations and warranties otherwise are inaccurate), it will
(individually, but not solidarily) indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against any Loss which any Buyer Indemnified Party may
suffer as a result thereof;

  



  

(b) Each Seller agrees that if the Corporation fails to observe or
perform any covenant or obligation under this Agreement, or breaches any of
its representations and warranties under Article 3 (with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 17 of _Schedule 3.1_ of
the Agreement only, as more particularly described in Section 17 of the
Disclosure Schedule) or in the bring-down certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 7.1(4) (or if any of such representations and warranties
otherwise are inaccurate), it will (individually but not solidarily)
indemnify and hold Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any
Loss which any Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer as a result thereof; and

  



  

(c) Each Seller agrees that it will (individually but not
solidarily) indemnify and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from
and against any Loss which any Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer as a result
of the matters set forth _Schedule 12.1(c)_ ;

  



  

(d) Buyer and Internap solidarily agree that if Buyer fails to
observe or perform any covenant or obligation under this Agreement, or
breaches any of its representation and warranty under Article 5 or in the
bring-down certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(2) (or if any of
such representations and warranties otherwise are inaccurate), it will
indemnify and hold each Seller and its Affiliates, and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against
any Loss which any such Seller Indemnified Party may suffer as a result
thereof;

  



  

(any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party making a claim for
indemnification under any provision of this Article 12 being the "Indemnified
Party", and the Party providing indemnification being the "Indemnifying
Party" for the purposes of this Article 12).

Section 12.2 Limitation on Indemnification, Deductible and Cap

  



  

(1)   The indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement, including Section 12.1 above, are limited as follows:

  



  

(a) the indemnification obligations of Sellers are subject to any
applicable limitations contained in Article 11 of this Agreement;

  



  

(b) the indemnification obligations of Sellers are not applicable
unless and until, and only to the extent that the aggregate of all Claims for
any breach, default or indemnification under the Agreement exceeds in the
aggregate, a deductible equal to $967,150, in which case, the Indemnifying
Party will be obligated to pay the entire amount owing in respect of such
Claims in excess of the amount of such deductible; provided, however, that
the foregoing deductible will not apply to (i) breaches or inaccuracies of
any Fundamental Representation or with respect to Section 30 (Tax Matters),
(ii) any breach of any covenant of the Corporation or the Sellers (including
those set forth in Section 10.1 of the Agreement), or (iii) the matters set
forth on _Schedule 12.1(c)_ ;

  



  

(c) the maximum indemnification obligations of Sellers shall be
limited as follows:

  



  

(i) with respect to Losses arising as a result of breaches or
inaccuracies of the Corporation's representations and warranties set forth in
_Schedule 3.1_ of the Agreement (other than Fundamental Representations or
with respect to Section 30 (Tax Matters)), ten percent (10%) of the Closing
Consideration in the aggregate with each Seller obligated for such Losses in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share;

  



  

(ii) with respect to Losses arising (A) as a result of breaches or
inaccuracies of the Fundamental Representations or (B) as a result
of breaches of covenants and agreements by the Corporation or the Sellers
hereunder (other than with respect to Section 10.1 (Tax Matters)), the
aggregate amount of the Closing Consideration; provided, however, that (I)
each Seller shall be obligated for such Losses in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share up to the Purchase Price, (II) each Seller shall be obligated for
Losses in accordance with its Adjusted Pro Rata Share to the extent that such
Losses exceed the Purchase Price but are less than or equal to the Closing
Consideration and (III) no Seller shall be obligated for Losses arising as a
result of another Seller's breaches of its representations and warranties set
forth in Article 4 of the Agreement, or as a result of another Seller's
breaches of its covenants and agreements hereunder; and

  



  

(iii) with respect to Losses arising as a result of breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 30 (Tax Matters) of 
_Schedule 3.1_ of the Agreement or as a result of breaches of the covenants
and agreements set forth in Section 10.1 (Tax Matters), the aggregate amount
of the Purchase Price, with each Seller obligated for such Losses in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share.

  



  

(d) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 12.2, (i) in the case of Losses arising out of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Corporation, the maximum amount that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may recover from the Sellers shall be limited to
the Closing Consideration; provided, however, that (A) each Seller shall be
obligated for such Losses in accordance with its Pro Rata Share up to the
Purchase Price and (B) each Seller shall be obligated for Losses in accordance
with its Adjusted Pro Rata Share to the extent that such Losses exceed the
Purchase Price but are less than or equal to the Closing Consideration; and
(ii) in the case of claims arising out of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of a particular Seller (the "Culpable Seller"), absent
complicity with the Culpable Seller, no other Seller shall be liable for
Losses arising in connection with the fraud or intentional misrepresentation
of the Culpable Seller; and

  



  

(e) for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting from
the matters described in Section 12.1 of the Agreement, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements applicable

  



    

29 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

thereto shall be deemed not to include any qualification or limitation with
respect to materiality (whether by the terms "material" or "materiality" or by
reference to a "Material Adverse Effect," or otherwise).

  



  

(2)   Any indemnification obligations of the Sellers hereunder shall
first be satisfied from the Escrow Indemnification.

  



  

(3)   Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this Agreement, the
Parties confirm that the maximum global indemnification obligations of each
of CDPQ and Fondaction, Le Fonds de developpement de la Confederation des
syndicats nationaux pour la cooperation et l'emploi ("Fondaction") under this
Agreement shall in no event exceed CDPQ's or Fondaction's respective Pro Rata
Share of the Purchase Price. Further, the maximum global indemnification
obligations of a Seller (other than CDPQ and Fondaction) under this Agreement
shall in no event exceed such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the
Closing Consideration.

  



  

Section 12.3 Notification

  



  

(1)   Promptly (but in any event not more than thirty (30) days after
having obtained such knowledge) upon obtaining knowledge thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any cause which the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to
indemnification under this Article 12 (an "Indemnification Notice"). Such
Indemnification Notice shall specify whether the Indemnity Claim arises as the
result of a Third Party Claim or as a result of a Direct Claim, and must also
specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is
available):

  



  

(a) the factual basis for the Indemnity Claim; and

  



  

(b) the amount of the Indemnity Claim, if known.

  



  

(2)   Upon receipt of an Indemnification Notice by an Indemnifying
Party, the provisions of Section 12.5 will apply to any Third Party Claim and
the provisions of Section 12.4 will apply to any Direct Claim.

  



  

(3)   The omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party does not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any duty to indemnify and hold harmless
which otherwise might exist with respect to such cause, unless the
notification occurs after the expiration of the applicable time limit, if
any, as set out in Article 11 or (and only to the extent that) the omission
to so notify prejudices the ability of the Indemnifying Party to exercise its
right to defend provided in Section 12.5 or cure or mitigate the Loss.

  



  

Section 12.4 Direct Claims

  



  

(1)   Following receipt of an Indemnification Notice pursuant to
Section 12.3 relating to a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) Business Days to investigate the Direct Claim and respond
in writing. For purposes of the investigation, the Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct Claim, together with such other
information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

  



  

(2)   If the Indemnifying Party disputes the validity or amount of the
Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice of the
dispute to the Indemnified Party within the thirty (30) Business Day period
specified in Section 12.4(1). The dispute notice must describe in reasonable
detail the nature of the Indemnifying Party's dispute. During the thirty (30)
day period immediately following receipt of a dispute notice by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party fail to resolve the dispute within that thirty (30) day
time period, the Indemnified Party is free to pursue all rights and remedies
available to it, subject only to this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party
fails to respond in

  



    

30 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

writing to the Direct Claim within the thirty (30) Business Day period
specified in this Section 12.4, the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have
refused the validity and amount of the Direct Claim.

  



  

Section 12.5 Defense of Third Party Claims

  



  

(1)   After receipt of the Indemnified Party's Indemnification Notice
pursuant to Section 12.3 relating to a Third Party Claim and upon giving
notice to the Indemnified Party within not more than thirty (30)
Business Days of such receipt, the Indemnifying Party has the right to defend
the Third Party Claim at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own
selection, provided that: (a) the Indemnified Party has at all times the right
to fully participate in the defence at its own cost and expense (provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party reimburses the Indemnified Party for
all defence costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party between the date of
the Indemnification Notice and the date the Indemnifying Party validly
exercises its right to defend the Third Party Claim); (b) the Third Party
Claim seeks only monetary damages and does not seek any injunctive or other
relief against the Indemnified Party; and (c) legal counsel chosen by the
Indemnifying Party is approved by the Indemnified Party, such approval not to
be withheld unreasonably.

  



  

(2)   The Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to compromise and
settle or to cause a compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably refused or withheld), unless: (a) the terms of the
compromise and settlement require only the payment of money and do not
require the Indemnified Party to admit any wrongdoing, take or refrain from
taking any action, acknowledge any rights of the third Person making the
Third Party Claim or waive any rights that the Indemnified Party may have
against such third Person making the Third Party Claim; (b) the Indemnified
Party receives, as part of the compromise and settlement, a legally binding
and enforceable unconditional release, which is in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from any and all
obligations or liabilities it may have with respect to the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b),
the Sellers shall not compromise and settle, or cause a compromise and
settlement of, any Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes of Pre-Closing
Period without the prior written consent of Buyer; and (c) the Indemnifying
Party unconditionally acknowledges in writing that it will indemnify and hold
the Indemnified Party harmless with respect to such compromise or settlement.

  



  

(3)   If the Indemnifying Party fails to give notice of its intention
to participate in the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 12.5(1),
then the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have waived its right
to participate in the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party will have
the right (but not the obligation) to undertake the defense of the Third
Party Claim; and, with the approval of the Indemnifying Party, compromise and
settle the Third Party Claim on behalf, for the account and at the risk and
expense of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(4)   If the Indemnifying Party participates in the defense of a Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will make available to the
Indemnifying Party those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence
is necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and participating
in the defense of such claim.

  



  

(5)   The Indemnified Party shall, at the request of the Indemnifying
Party, make available to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives on a
timely basis all documents, records and other materials in the possession
of the Indemnified Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for its use in defending any
Third Party Claim, the defense of which it has elected to participate in, and
the Indemnified Party shall otherwise cooperate on a timely basis with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim.

  



  

(6)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.5 to the contrary,
if, in cases where the Indemnifying Party is also party to the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint

  



    

31 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

representation would not be appropriate, then the Indemnified Party may, by
notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise or settle such Third Party Claim.

  



  

Section 12.6 Insurance Adjustments

  



  

If, prior to the settlement and payment of a claim for Losses by a Seller or
the Buyer, as applicable, the Indemnified Party receives a payment from an
insurance carrier in connection with the Losses to which such claim relates,
the amount of Losses recoverable by the Indemnified Party under this
Article 12 from the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, for such claim shall
be reduced by the amount of such insurance payment, net of any increase in
premiums to be paid by the Indemnified Party related to the insurance
carrier's payment of such claim. If an Indemnified Party receives any
insurance payment in connection with any claim for Losses for which it already
received payment from a Seller or Buyer, as applicable, within thirty (30)
days of receiving such insurance payment, the Indemnified Party shall pay to
the Escrow Agent for deposit in the Escrow Indemnification, the amount of the
insurance payments received, net of any increase in premiums to be paid by
the Indemnified Party related to the insurance carrier's payment of such
claim. In the event the Escrow Indemnification has been fully disbursed or
has been closed, then within thirty (30) days of receiving such insurance
payment, the Indemnified Party shall pay to (a) CDPQ and Fondaction an amount
equal to their respective Pro Rata Share of such net insurance payment and
(b) to Sellers' Representative the remaining amount of such payment, for
distribution by Sellers' Representative to the Sellers (other than CDPQ and
Fondaction) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of such net
insurance payment. Buyer shall cause the Targets to use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover any amount payable by the insurance carrier,
but in no circumstance shall the Targets be obligated to institute legal
recourse against their respective insurers.

  



  

Section 12.7 Indemnification - Non-Merger

  



  

The indemnification covenants contained in this Article 12 will not merge on
Closing but will survive subject only to any limits imposed by this Article
12.

  



  

Section 12.8 Exclusive Remedy

  



  

(1)   After the Closing Time, except with respect to fraud, the rights
of indemnity in this Article 12 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
set forth in Section 10.1 (Tax Matters)) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of each Indemnified Party:

  



  

(a) in respect of Third Party Claims which may be brought against
it; and

  



  

(b) for monetary compensation for any Loss which it may suffer or
incur as a result of, in respect of, or arising out of any non-fulfillment of
any covenant or agreement on behalf of another Party, or any incorrectness in
or breach of any representation or warranty by another Party, contained in
the Agreement or in any other agreement or document delivered pursuant to the
Agreement.

  



  

(2)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each
Seller and each Target (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters, the Financing, or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith and each Seller and
each Target (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) agrees not to commence any
action or proceeding against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters, the Financing, or in respect of
any other document or theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such
action or proceeding asserted by any of them (on behalf of itself and any of
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters, the
Financing or in respect of any other document or theory of law or

  



    

32 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

equity against any Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise terminated.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any liability for
any claims or damages to any Seller or any Target in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. For greater certainty, nothing contained in
this Section 12.8(2) shall limit or restrict in any manner the rights that
the Sellers may have against the Buyer or Internap hereunder.

  



  

Section 12.9 General Indemnification Rules

  



  

The obligations of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party
in respect of any Loss shall also be subject to the principles set forth in
this Section 12.9.

  



  

(1)   Subject to Section 12.6, the obligation of indemnification shall
not apply to the extent that any Loss claimed has been reimbursed through
insurance to the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(2)   The amount of Losses shall be reduced by any allowance,
provision or reserve in respect of the matter giving rise to such Claim
included in the Financial Statements or the Final Working Capital, if any.

  



  

Section 12.10 Duty to Mitigate

  



  

Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or limit the general
obligation at law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate any Loss which it may
suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an Indemnifying Party of any
representation or warranty or the breach of any covenant of the Indemnifying
Party hereunder.

  



  

Section 12.11 No Contribution

  



  

Indemnification obligations under this Article 12 will be determined without
regard to any right to indemnification that any Seller may have in his, her or
its capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of any of the Targets
prior to the Closing and no such Seller will be entitled to any
indemnification from any of the Targets for amounts paid for indemnification
under this Article 12\. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any
claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party against a Seller under the
Agreement or otherwise relating to the Agreement, each Seller expressly
waives any right of subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or
other claim against any of the Targets with respect to any amounts owed by
such Seller pursuant to the Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.12 Consideration Adjustment

  



  

Any payment made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under
this Article 12 shall constitute an adjustment to Purchase Price.

  



  

Article 13 - TERMINATION

  



  

Section 13.1 Termination Rights

  



  

This Agreement may be terminated:

  



  

(a) prior to Closing, by mutual written agreement of the Sellers and
Buyer;

  



  

(b) by notice given by Buyer to the Sellers' Representative for
failure of a condition stipulated in Section 7.1 to be satisfied by noon on
December 23, 2013 if Buyer has not waived such condition; provided that Buyer
shall not be entitled to so terminate the Agreement if the failure of the
Sellers to satisfy such condition results from a breach by Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement;

  



    

33 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) by notice given by the Sellers' Representative to Buyer for
failure of a condition stipulated in Section 7.2 to be satisfied by noon on
December 23, 2013 if the Sellers' Representative has not waived such
condition; provided that the Sellers' Representative shall not be entitled
to so terminate the Agreement if the failure of Buyer to satisfy such
condition results from a breach by the Sellers of their obligations under
this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by notice given by either Party if there has been a material
breach of any provision of this Agreement, and such breach has not
been waived by the non-breaching Party, that remains uncured for a period of
twenty (20) consecutive days commencing on the day that the non-breaching
Party provides the breaching Party with Notice that there has been a material
breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(e) by the Sellers' Representative or Buyer if Closing has not
occurred (other than through or as a result of a failure of the Party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this
Agreement) on or before noon on December 23, 2013 or such later date as the
Parties may agree in writing;

  



  

(f) by either Party if after the date of this Agreement any Law is
enacted, made or amended that makes the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise
prohibited or enjoins the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Law (if applicable) or
enjoinment shall have become final and non-appealable.

  



  

Section 13.2 Effect of Termination

  



  

(1)   Each Party's right of termination under this Article 13 is in
addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise,
and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election
of remedies. Nothing in this Article 13 limits or affects any other rights or
causes of action any Party may have with respect to the representations,
warranties, covenants and indemnities in its favour contained in this
Agreement. If a Party waives compliance with any of the conditions,
obligations or covenants contained in this Agreement, the waiver will
be without prejudice to any of its rights of termination in the event of non-
fulfilment, non-observance or non-performance of any other condition,
obligation or covenant in whole or in part.

  



  

(2)   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.1, all
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that:

  



  

(a) Section 6.4 (Confidentiality), Section 14.3 (Costs and
Expenses), Section 14.9 (Governing Law and Submission to Jurisdiction),
Section 14.11 (Notices), Section14.13 (Public Notice) and this Section 13.2,
and each party's obligations under such foregoing sections, will survive; and

  



  

(b) if this Agreement is terminated by a Party because of a breach
of this Agreement by the other Party or because a condition for the benefit
of the terminating Party has not been satisfied because the other Party has
failed to perform any of its obligations or covenants under this Agreement,
the terminating Party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired; provided that, for greater certainty, a failure to
satisfy a condition in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 to the extent it is not
reasonably within the control of a Seller in the case of Section 7.1 or not
reasonably within the control of Buyer in the case of Section 7.2 shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Article 14 - GENERAL

  



  

Section 14.1 Amendment

  



  

This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by
written agreement signed by Buyer and each of the Sellers. No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of
any other provision (whether or not similar), nor shall such

  



    

34 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

waiver be binding unless executed in writing by the Sellers' Representative
on behalf of the Sellers, or Buyer, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 14.2 Assignment

  



  

Without limiting Section 14.6, neither the Agreement nor any right or
obligation under the Agreement may be assigned by any Party without the prior
consent of the other Parties (except that Buyer may assign its rights under
this Agreement to one or more lenders as collateral security).

  



  

Section 14.3 Costs and expenses

  



  

Except as otherwise specified in the Agreement (including with respect to
Transaction Expenses), all costs and expenses (including the fees and
disbursements of accountants, legal counsel and other professional advisers)
incurred in connection with the Agreement and the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement are to be paid by the Party
incurring those costs and expenses.

  



  

Section 14.4 Counterparts

  



  

The Agreement may be executed and delivered by the Parties in one or more
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered will be an
original, and those counterparts will together constitute one and the same
instrument.

  



  

Section 14.5 Currency

  



  

Unless otherwise specified, the word "dollar" and "$" sign refer to U.S.
currency, and all amounts to be advanced, paid or calculated under the
Agreement are to be advanced, paid or calculated in U.S. currency. In the
event that an amount subject to this Agreement is expressed in
Canadian dollars or another currency and such amount is to be exchanged into
U.S. dollars, the Parties shall apply the reported exchange rate for the U.S.
dollar to such currency quoted by the Bank of Canada (or such other source to
which Buyer and the Sellers' Representative may agree in writing)
representing the noon rate on the applicable date (or, in the case of the
Estimated Statements, the noon rate on the Business Day prior to their
delivery to Buyer).

  



  

Section 14.6 Enurement

  



  

The Agreement enures to the benefit of and is binding upon the Parties and
their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
assigns. Except as provided in Sections 12.8(2) and 14.9 and this Section
14.6, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; provided that the Financing Sources shall be intended third parties
beneficiaries of Sections 12.8(2) and 14.9 and this Section 14.6 and shall be
entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no amendment or modification
to such provisions in respect to the Financing Sources may be made without
the prior consent of the Financing Sources).

  



  

Section 14.7 E-mail transmission

  



  

Delivery of the Agreement by e-mail constitutes valid and effective delivery.

  



  

Section 14.8 Further assurances

  



  

Each Party will, at the requesting Party's cost, execute and deliver any
further agreements and documents and provide any further assurances as may be
reasonably required by the other Party or Parties to give effect to the
Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, will do
or cause to be done all acts and things, execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered all agreements and

  



    

35 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

documents and provide any assurances, undertakings and information as may be
required from time to time by all Governmental Authorities or as may be
required from time to time under applicable securities Laws.

  



  

Section 14.9 Governing Law and Submission to Jurisdiction

  



  

(1)   The Agreement is governed by, and is to be construed and
interpreted in accordance with, the Laws applicable in the Province of Quebec
and the federal Laws of Canada applicable therein.

  



  

(2)   Each of the Parties irrevocably submits and attorns to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Quebec (judicial
district of Montreal) to determine all issues, whether at law or in equity
arising from the Agreement.

  



  

(3)   To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties
irrevocably waives any objection (including any claim of inconvenient forum)
to the venue of any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the
Agreement in the courts of the Province of Quebec, or that the subject matter
of the Agreement may not be enforced in these courts, and irrevocably agrees
not to seek, and hereby waives any right to, judicial review by any court
which may be called upon to enforce the judgment of these courts, of the
substantive merits of any such suit, action or proceeding.

  



  

(4)   To the extent a Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
that Party irrevocably waives that immunity in respect of its
obligations under the Agreement.

  



  

(5)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but without
limiting Section 12.8(2)), each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim,
controversy or dispute any kind or nature (whether based upon contract, tort
or otherwise) against a Financing Source that is in any way related to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
or the Financing Commitment Letters shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to
conflict of law principles (other than sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New
York General Obligations Law).

  



  

(6)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but without
limiting Section 12.8(2)), each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters, or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof), and
that the provisions immediately below relating to the waiver of jury trial
shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim.

  



  

(7)   EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

liability, including

  



    

40

all provisions of this Agreement relating to limitation of liability and
resolution of disputes. Internap hereby irrevocably waives any benefit of
discussion or division and agrees that its liability under this guarantee
shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to or a
legal discharge of Internap, except to the extent that such
circumstance constitutes a defense for Buyer.

The parties have executed this Agreement.
