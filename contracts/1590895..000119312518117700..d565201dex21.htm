bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall

Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such

conditions at the Closing); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Acquirors may
elect to defer the Closing to the last Business Day of the month in which the

time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (which filing shall immediately follow the
consummation of the Real Estate Purchase), or such later date and time as is
agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Acquirors, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Share_ " and collectively, the "
_Company Shares_ "), other than Company Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _(c)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Company
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent and Merger Sub Owned Shares_.
Each Company Share held by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise),
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

 



4 (c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity
and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) for the purpose of delivering or causing to be
delivered to each holder of Company Shares the Per Share Merger Consideration
that such holder shall become entitled to receive with respect to each
Company Share held by such holder pursuant to the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
"). The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, (x) Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, the Parent Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent
and (y) following the RE Closing, the Company shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, a cash amount equal to the Real Estate Purchase Price _plus_ a
cash amount equal to the Aruba Proceeds (if any) _minus_ the amount of the
Aruba Expenses (if any) _minus_ the amount of Insight Liabilities (if any)
_minus_ the amount of the Real Estate Purchase Tax Amount _minus_ 50% of the
Estimated State Income Tax Amount (which Estimated State Income Tax Amount
shall be limited to a maximum of $38,000,000 for this purpose) _minus_ the
excess, if any of the Estimated State Income Tax Amount over $38,000,000 with
the Paying Agent (such cash deposited with the Paying Agent, collectively, the
" _Payment Fund_ "), which holders of Company Shares (other than Company
Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _(c)_
or Dissenting Shares), shall be entitled to at the Effective Time upon due
surrender of the Certificates Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates) or Book-Entry Company Shares. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the Company Shares; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the
United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investor
Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively. Earnings from
such investments shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Company Shares.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company
Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Company
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall include any certifications Parent may
reasonably request relating to any withholding obligations of 

 



5  Parent under the Code or other applicable Tax Law, and shall otherwise be in
such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in
exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Company
Share. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with delivery of
a letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Company
Share formerly represented by such Certificates (without interest and after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.4_),
and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of
the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so
surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates
representing Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive the Dissenting Stockholder Consideration.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") shall be required
to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Company
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Company Shares
held through The Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall, upon receipt of an "agentÂ’s message"
in customary form by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence of transfer or
surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository
Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such Book-Entry
Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.4_), and
such Book-Entry Company Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Company Shares not held
through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall include any certifications Parent may reasonably request relating to any
withholding obligations of Parent under the Code

 



6  or other applicable Tax Law and be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter
of transmittal in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in proper
form, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the holder
of such Book-Entry Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such Book-Entry
Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (without interest
and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.4_), and such Book-Entry Company Shares shall forthwith be
cancelled. Payment and delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Company Shares shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Company Shares are registered. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Company
Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry
Company Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Company Shares
representing Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive the Dissenting Stockholder Consideration.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares that represented ownership of
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds in the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to Parent or an Affiliate
thereof designated by Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares for the Per Share
Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, in respect of such holderÂ’s surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Company Shares and in compliance with the procedures in _Section
2.2(b)_. Any Aggregate Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent or an Affiliate thereof designated by Parent,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective Affiliates will
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Company Shares for the
Aggregate Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned 

 



7  property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_
in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent or an Affiliate
thereof designated by Parent, upon demand.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificates
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) and held by a holder
who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Company Shares
in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
granted to them under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholder
Consideration_ "). If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or
other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the Dissenting
Stockholder Consideration in respect of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with this
_Article 2_ and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.
The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of
any such demand, and any other demands, notices or instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the
Dissenting Stockholder Consideration for such Dissenting Shares, and Parent
shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing, except
to the extent required by applicable Law.

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the

 



8  Treasury Regulations or any other provision of applicable Law. Any amounts
deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be timely remitted to the
applicable Taxing Authority and, when so remitted, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. If Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company become aware that any amount is required to be withheld
from the Aggregate Merger Consideration (other than pursuant to Section 1471,
1472 or 3406 of the Code), it shall promptly notify the other parties to this
Agreement. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to notify the Company and
the Significant Stockholder of any amounts required to be withheld or
deducted from the Aggregate Merger Consideration and remitted to any Taxing
Authority (other than pursuant to Section 1471, 1472 or 3406 of the Code),
including providing a copy of the Law pursuant to which such withholding is
to be made, at least twenty (20) days before any such withholding.

2.5 _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company Shares
shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of Equity Interests
convertible into or exchangeable for Company Shares), recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event, the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
event and to provide to holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to
take any such action or effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section
6.1_).

 

ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
the Acquirors and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") prior to
the execution of this Agreement (with specific reference to the
representations and warranties in this _Article 3_ to which the information in
such schedule relates; _provided_ that disclosure in the Company Disclosure
Letter as to a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other
Sections of this Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross reference) it is reasonably apparent on its face that
such disclosure relates to such other Sections), and (b) as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2017 and publicly available at
least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (other than any disclosures contained in the "Forward Looking
Statements" or "Risk Factors" sections of such Company SEC Documents, and any
other disclosures contained in such Company SEC Documents that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature), where the relevance of the
information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure, the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Acquirors and
Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Standing; Power_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a limited liability
company, limited partnership, general partnership or corporation, as
applicable, duly organized,

 



9  validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its formation, organization or incorporation, as applicable, (ii) has all
requisite limited liability company, limited partnership, general partnership
or corporate power, as applicable, and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and (iii) is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except with
respect to _clause (iii)_ where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has previously furnished to the Acquirors a true and complete
copy of the Organizational Documents of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each
as so delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation
of, and no Subsidiary is in material violation of, any provision of its
Organizational Documents.

3.2 _Authority_. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
it is a party and, subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement and the Disaffiliation Agreement by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by the Company Board and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party or to consummate the Transactions, other
than the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State as required by the
DGCL. This Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and the
Disaffiliation Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Acquirors
and Merger Sub, as applicable, will constitute a valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally or by general principles of
equity). As of the date hereof, the Company Board, at a meeting duly called
at which all of the directors of the Company were present, has unanimously
approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase
Agreement, the Disaffiliation Agreement and the Transactions and, subject to
_Section 6.4_, has resolved to recommend that the CompanyÂ’s stockholders
approve this Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, the Disaffiliation
Agreement and the Transactions. The Company Stockholder Approval is the only
vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company necessary to approve this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements to which
the Company is a party, the Merger, the Real Estate Purchase and the other
Transactions.

 

3.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

violate the Organizational Documents of the Company, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through

described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties are bound, (iii) result in any breach or violation of,
or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit under,
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any Company Material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties are bound or (iv) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through _(vii)_ of 
_subsection (b)_ below have been obtained and all filings described in such
clauses have been made, give any Governmental Entity the right to revoke,
withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate or materially modify, any material Permit
and Approval applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ to
_(iv)_ , for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or
other occurrence that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions, do not and will not require the Company to
obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or to
make any filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory
authority (including any stock exchange and any Gaming Authority), agency,
court, commission, or other governmental body (each, a " _Governmental
Entity_ "), except for (i) such filings as may be required under applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_
"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and under state
securities, takeover and "blue sky" Laws, (ii) the filings required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR
Act_ "), (iii) such filings and other actions as are necessary to obtain all

_Section 3.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (v) such filings as are
necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of the OTCQB, (vi) the
filing with the Delaware Secretary of State of the Certificate of Merger
as required by the DGCL, and (vii) any such consent, approval, authorization,
permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.4 _Litigation_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (a) there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding,
arbitration, mediation or investigation (each, an " _Action_ ") pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties by or before any

Gaming Laws).

 



11 3.5 _Ownership and Operations of the Company_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
Company Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per
share (the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the date hereof, (i) 23,834,512
Company Shares were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and were free of preemptive rights and (ii) no
Company Shares were held in treasury. As of the date hereof, no shares of
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Except as set forth above, as of
the date of this Agreement, (i) there are (A) no outstanding Equity Interests
of the Company, (B) no Equity Interests of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company or (C) no options or other rights to acquire from the Company, and
no obligation of the Company to issue, any Equity Interests of the Company,
(ii) there are no outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests of the Company, and (iii) there are
no other options, calls, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements
or commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued Equity
Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party except as contemplated by the Real Estate
Purchase Agreement.

(b) _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company and for each such Subsidiary,
its state of organization, entity type, and outstanding number and type of
Equity Interests. Each of the outstanding Equity Interests of each of
the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such Equity Interests are (i) owned by the Company or
another wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) free and clear of all
Liens. 

3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports,
statements, certifications and other documents (including all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2017
(all such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed
since January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof, collectively, the "
_Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as
of the date of the last such amendment, each of the Company SEC Documents
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case
may be, each as in effect on the date so filed. As of their respective filing
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment or superseding filing), none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the
SEC.

 



12 (b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the CompanyÂ’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated.

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities and that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of the CompanyÂ’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued or contingent, of a nature that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
except for liabilities and obligations (a) reflected or reserved against in
the CompanyÂ’s consolidated balance sheet on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC, (b) incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the date of such balance sheet, none of which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (c) which have been discharged or paid in full prior
to the date of this Agreement or (d) incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since January 1, 2018, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any off-balance sheet
transactions, arrangements, or obligations (including contingent obligations)
that may have a current or future material effect on the financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or
significant components of revenues or expenses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2018 through the
date of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
and there has not been any event, development or state of circumstances that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.9 _Vote/Approval Required_. The affirmative vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Shares in favor of each of
(a) adopting this Agreement and (b) approving the transactions contemplated by
the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, including the Real Estate Purchase, and
the transactions contemplated by _Section 6.16 _

 



13  (collectively, the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ") are the only votes or
consents of the holders of any class or series of the CompanyÂ’s Equity
Interests necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Company is a party or to consummate the Transactions,
including the Merger and the Real Estate Purchase. The delivery of the
Significant Stockholder Consent will satisfy the Company Stockholder
Approval.

3.10 _Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Taxes, ERISA, labor matters and environmental
matters (which are the subject of _Section 3.11_,  _Section 3.12_, _Section
3.13_ and _Section 3.14_, respectively), the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws applicable to them or by which
any of their respective properties are bound, except where any non-compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except with respect to Environmental Laws
(which are the subject of _Section 3.14_), the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been and are in compliance with all applicable licenses, permits,
approvals, authorizations, registrations, findings of suitability, franchises,
entitlements, waivers and exemptions of all Governmental
Entities (collectively, " _Permits and Approvals_ ") necessary for them to
own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on their respective
businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits and Approvals the absence
of, or noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially
impair or materially delay the Closing. Since January 1, 2013, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors,
officers or employees nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of their
respective agents acting for or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
has (i) made, authorized or offered any payment or transfer of anything of
value to any employee or official of any Governmental Entity, political party
or campaign, official or employee of any public international organization, or
official or employee of any government-owned enterprise or institution to
obtain or retain business or secure an improper advantage, or (ii) otherwise
conducted any transaction, transfer or business in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practice Act of 1977, as amended, or any other applicable anti-
corruption, anti-bribery or anti-money laundering Law.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all Permits and
Approvals (including Gaming Approvals) necessary for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on their
respective businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits and Approvals
the absence of, or noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially affect the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses as currently conducted or materially impair or
materially delay the Closing. To the Knowledge of the Company, each (i) of
the Affiliates of the Company and its Subsidiaries that will be included in
the process of determining the suitability of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for a Gaming Approval by a Gaming Authority and (ii) director, officer,
partner and manager of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Persons performing
management functions similar to those performed by officers, partners or
managers (the Persons contemplated by sub-sections (i) and (ii),
collectively, " _Company Licensed Parties_ "), hold all Permits and Approvals
(including Gaming Approvals) necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on their
respective businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits and Approvals
the absence of, or noncompliance with, would not, individually or in the

 



14  aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially affect the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses as currently conducted or materially impair or
materially delay the Closing. All such Permits and Approvals are in full
force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially affect the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses as currently
conducted or materially impair or materially delay the Closing. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which permits, or upon the
giving of notice or passage of time or both, would permit, revocation, non-
renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination of any Permits
and Approvals that are currently in effect, the loss of which would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to materially affect
the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses as currently conducted or
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. The Company, its
Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of the Company, each of the Company
Licensed Parties, are in good standing, and in compliance with all Gaming
Laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Licensed Party owns or operates gaming facilities.
Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any of the Company Licensed Parties has received written
notice within the past five (5) years of any investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or its or its SubsidiariesÂ’
businesses and operations, other than investigations or reviews (x) conducted
in connection with ordinary license renewal procedures and/or (y) the outcome
of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or materially
delay the Closing. To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no investigation or review is
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated in writing any intention
to conduct the same, other than investigations or reviews (x) conducted in
connection with ordinary license renewal procedures and/or (y) the outcome of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or materially
delay the Closing.

(c) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any Company Licensed Party has received any written claim,
demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Entity in the past three (3) years under, or
relating to any violation or possible violation of, any Gaming Law which did
or would reasonably be likely to result in an individual fine or penalty of
$25,000 or more. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts which, if
known to any Gaming Authority, would be reasonably likely to result in the
revocation, limitation or suspension of a Permit and Approval (including any
Gaming Approval) or result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability
proceedings or registrations, in each case with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Company Licensed Party. Neither the Company, nor any of

Company and its Subsidiaries, including taking commercially reasonable steps
to safeguard any such information that is accessible through computer systems
or networks. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no
misappropriation or unauthorized access, use, modification or breach of
security of Trade Secrets maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property Rights of any Third Party in a manner that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
issued any notice or claim since January 1, 2016 that a Third Party is
misappropriating or infringing any Owned Company Intellectual Property and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no Third Party is misappropriating
or infringing any Owned Company Intellectual Property. No Owned Company
Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree,
agreement, or stipulation restricting or limiting any use or licensing thereof
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company or its Subsidiaries solely and exclusively own
all right, title and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce)
the Owned Company Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens), and have not granted any license, 

 



25  covenant, release, immunity or other right with respect to any Owned Company
Intellectual Property to any Person other than (i) non-exclusive licenses
granted in the ordinary course of business in connection with marketing and
promotional activities and (ii) cross-licensing of Intellectual Property in
the ordinary course of business.

 

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and each Subsidiary has (i)
complied in all material respects with its respective privacy policies and
all applicable Laws relating to privacy and data security, including with
respect to the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure and use
of Personal Information, and (ii) implemented and maintained a data security
plan which maintains effective and commercially reasonable administrative,
technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against
loss, damage and unauthorized access, use modifications or other misuse. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material loss, damage or
unauthorized access, use, modification or breach of security of Personal
Information maintained by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case that are material to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the
Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2016, no Person (including any
Governmental Entity) has made any claim or commenced any action with
respect to loss, damage or unauthorized access, use, modification or breach
of security of Personal Information maintained by or on behalf of any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case that are material to the operations
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Real Estate
Purchase Agreement, or the consummation of the Transactions will, or
reasonably would be expected to, result in any material violation of any
privacy policy of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any applicable Law
pertaining to privacy, data security or Personal Information.

"fair price," "moratorium," "acquisition of controlling interest,"
"combinations with interested stockholders" or similar anti-takeover Law
(collectively, the " _Takeover Laws_ ") enacted in any state in the United
States applies to this Agreement or the Real Estate Purchase Agreement or to
any of the Transactions, including the Merger and the Real Estate Purchase.

3.21  _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s, financial advisorÂ’s or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2017
and publicly available at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement (other than any disclosures contained in the
"Forward Looking Statements" or "Risk Factors" sections of such Parent SEC
Documents, and any other disclosures contained in such Parent SEC Documents
that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature), where the
relevance of the information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes
of) a particular representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure, Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i) is a corporation or a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power, as applicable, and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary.

(b) Parent has previously furnished to the Company a true and complete copy
of the Organizational Documents of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any
provision of its Organizational Documents.

4.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and consummate the Acquiror Transactions. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Acquiror Transactions
have been duly authorized by the board of directors of each of Parent and
Merger Sub and by Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
approve this Agreement or to consummate the Acquiror Transactions, other than
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company and Gamma, will
constitute a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally or by general principles of
equity). No approval of the holders of the Equity Interests of Parent is
required to consummate the Acquiror Transactions.

 

4.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by each of Parent and Merger Sub
and the

 



27  consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Acquiror Transactions,
do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the Organizational Documents
of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through _(vi)_ of _subsection
(b)_ below have been obtained and all filings described in such clauses have
been made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub or by which any of their respective properties are bound, (iii) result in
any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or result in the
loss of a benefit under, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
of, any material contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by
which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound, or
(iv) conflict with any Debt Financing Condition, except, in the case of
_clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflict, breach, violation,
default, loss, right or other occurrence that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party by each of Parent and Merger Sub,
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Acquiror Transactions,
does not and will not require Parent or Merger Sub to obtain any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or to make any filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) such filings as may
be required under applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and under state securities, takeover
and "blue sky" Laws, (ii) the filings required under the HSR Act, (iii) such
filings and other action as are necessary to obtain all required Gaming
Approvals, (iv) such filings as necessary to comply with the applicable
requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, (v) the filing with the Delaware
Secretary of State of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, and
(vi) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit, action, filing or
notification the failure of which to make or obtain would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no dispute or conflict arising from
its status as an Acquiror that would reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has entered
into any agreement with Gamma that would reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or that is inconsistent with the purposes and
intent of the parties to consummate the Transactions.

 

4.4 _Litigation_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect, (a) there is no Action pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective properties by or before any Governmental Entity, and (b) neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding judgment,
order, injunction, rule or decree of any Governmental Entity (other than
orders relating to the ordinary course operation of the business of Parent or
its Subsidiaries issued by Gaming Authorities under applicable Gaming Laws).

 

4.5 _Ownership of Company Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary of Parent beneficially owns any Company Shares as of the date
hereof. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last
three years has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the

 



28  Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated by
this Agreement). None of the requirements or restrictions of any Takeover Laws
enacted in any state in the United States applies to this Agreement or to any
of the Acquiror Transactions, including the Merger.

4.6 _Licensability; Compliance With Laws_.

(a) None of Parent, its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of
the Affiliates of Parent or its Subsidiaries that may reasonably be
considered in the process of determining the suitability of Parent or any
director, officer, partner and manager of the Parent and its Subsidiaries and
Persons performing management functions similar to those performed by
officers, partners or managers (collectively, the " _Parent License Parties_
") has (i) withdrawn, been denied, or had revoked, a Gaming Approval by a
Governmental Entity (including any Gaming Authority) or (ii) suffered a
suspension or limitation with respect to a Gaming Approval, in each case
within the last five (5) years. Parent, its Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge
of Parent, each of the Parent License Parties, are in good standing, and in
compliance with all Gaming Laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent License Party owns or operates
gaming facilities. To Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts, which if known
to the Gaming Authorities would (a) be reasonably likely to result in the
denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval currently
held by any Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent License Party, or
(b) result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings or
registrations with respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent
License Party, or with respect to the Gaming Approvals necessary for the
consummation of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent, its Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the
Parent License Parties, hold all Permits and Approvals (including Gaming
Approvals) necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease or operate
their properties and to carry on their respective businesses as now conducted,
except for any Permits and Approvals the absence of, or noncompliance with,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits and Approvals are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, no event has
occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or
both, would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any such Permits and Approvals that are currently
in effect, the loss of which would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any
Parent License Party, has received written notice within the past five (5)
years of any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity under any
Gaming Laws with respect to its business and operations, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no investigation or review is threatened, nor has any
Governmental Entity indicated in writing any intention to conduct the same,
other than those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

4.7 _Solvency of Parent_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 3_ hereof, immediately
following the Effective Time and after

 



29  giving effect to the Real Estate Purchase and the Merger and taking into
account the financing necessary in order to consummate the Merger and the
payment of the Real Estate Purchase Price by Gamma, (a) each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will not (i) be insolvent (either because their
respective financial conditions are such that the sum of their debts is
greater than the fair market value of their assets or because the fair
saleable value of their assets is less than the amount required to pay their
probable liability on their existing debts as such debts mature); (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in their respective
businesses; or (iii) have incurred, nor have intended to incur or believe
they have incurred, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as such debts
become due; and (b) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis
are, and will be, Solvent (as each such term in this clause (b) is defined in
Annex III to the Commitment Letter, without giving effect to any modifications
thereto).

 

4.8 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy of an executed Commitment Letter (including all exhibits,
annexes, schedules and term sheets and the executed fee letters attached
thereto or contemplated thereby, the " _Commitment Letter_ ") ( _provided_
that provisions in the fee letters or Commitment Letter relating solely
to fees and economic terms agreed to by the parties may be redacted (none of
which redacted provisions adversely affect the availability of or impose
additional conditions on, the availability of the Debt Financing at the
Closing)), dated as of April 15, 2018 (such Commitment Letter as the same may
be amended or replaced pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of, _Section 6.18_, is referred to herein as the " _Debt Financing
Commitment_ "), among Parent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender (the "
_Lender_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, Lender has agreed, subject
to the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing Commitment, to provide or
cause to be provided, the financing commitments specified therein, the
proceeds of which (including proceeds of any notes offering contemplated
thereby) are to be used to fund the Parent Merger Consideration, refinance
outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and pay transaction fees and
expenses. The financing commitments contemplated under the Debt Financing
Commitment, as amended or replaced in compliance with _Section 6.18_, are
referred to herein, individually and collectively, as the " _Debt Financing_
". The satisfaction of the Debt Financing Conditions do not and shall not
conflict with the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ , _and 7.3_
hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Debt Financing Commitment that are payable on or prior to
the date hereof and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Debt Financing Commitment
is, as of the date hereof, in full force and effect. The Debt Financing
Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The Debt Financing Commitment
(or any Debt Financing contemplated thereunder) has not been or will not be
amended or modified, except as consistent with _Section 6.18_, and, as of
the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment has not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, (i) no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under the Debt Financing Commitment,
and (ii) subject to the Acquisition Agreement Representations (as defined in
the Commitment Letter, without giving effect to any modifications thereto)
being true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof, but
only to the extent that the failure of the Acquisition Agreement
Representations to be true and correct in all material respects gives Parent
and Gamma the right to terminate their respective obligations contained in
this Agreement, the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of their
obligations contained in this Agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ hereof, Parent has no reason

 



30  to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any material
term or condition of closing to be satisfied by the Debt Financing Commitment
on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, there are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment.
As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters, which do not
contain provisions that impose any additional conditions to the funding of the
Debt Financing not otherwise set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment)
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing. The
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, together
with the available cash of Parent and the Company on the Closing Date (if
any), and any Alternative Financing (if any), will be sufficient for Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.9  _Ownership of Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding Equity
Interests of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly
or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for purposes of the
Merger and, except for matters incident to formation and execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the Transactions, has not
prior to the date hereof engaged in any business or other activities.

 

4.10 _Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent nor any of their
respective officers or directors on behalf of Parent or such Subsidiary of
Parent has employed any financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any financial advisory, brokerÂ’s fees, commissions or finderÂ’s
fees in connection with any of the Acquiror Transactions.

the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, or to consummate the Acquiror

Gamma in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability

reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights
generally or by general principles of equity).

5.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

material contract to which Gamma is a party or by which Gamma or any of its
respective properties are bound, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and
_(iii)_ , for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or
other occurrence that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, by Gamma, and the consummation
by Gamma of the Acquiror Transactions, does not and will not require Gamma to
obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or to

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and under

32 (c) To the Knowledge of Gamma, there is no dispute or conflict arising from
its status as an Acquiror that would reasonably be expected to have an

(a) None of Gamma, its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Gamma, any of
the Affiliates of Gamma and its Subsidiaries that may reasonably

director, officer, partner and manager of Gamma and its Subsidiaries and
Persons performing management functions similar to those performed by
officers, partners or managers (collectively, the " _Gamma License Parties_
") has (i) withdrawn, been denied, or had revoked, a Gaming Approval by a
Governmental Entity (including any Gaming Authority) or (ii) suffered a
suspension or limitation with respect to a Gaming Approval, in each case
within the last five (5) years. Gamma, its Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge
of Gamma, each of the Gamma License Parties, are in good standing, and in
compliance with all Gaming Laws, in each of the jurisdictions in which any
Gamma, its Subsidiaries or any Gamma License Party owns or operates gaming

required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or
furnish such information to the extent that the Company reasonably believes
that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (but
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege), or (B) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law,

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.3_, from and after the
date hereof until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_ , the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives not to, on
behalf of the Company, directly or indirectly initiate, solicit, facilitate
or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposal or the making or submission

authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue,

received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that is
not solicited in violation of  _Section 6.3(a)_ and the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives are not in willful and material
breach of this _Section 6.3_ with respect to such Third Party and (ii) the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, based on information then available and after consultation with outside
counsel and based on financial analyses reasonably believed to be reasonable

result in, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (x) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making
such Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and potential sources of

concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to such
person or its Representatives unless such information has been previously
provided or made available to the Acquirors and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify the
Acquirors in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or request for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, which
notice shall identify the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and
include a copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such Acquisition
Proposal was not submitted in writing, a reasonably detailed written
description of such Acquisition Proposal including its material terms and
conditions), and whether the Company has furnished non-public information to,
or entered into negotiations or discussions with, such Third Party. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep the Acquirors promptly informed
(and in any event within 48 hours) in all material respects of the status of,
and any material communications relating to, such Acquisition
Proposal (including any change in the price or other material terms thereof).
The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not take any action that
would prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from complying with
their respective obligations under this _Section 6.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.3(a)_,
if (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party that is not solicited in violation of _Section 6.3(a)_, (ii)
the Company, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives are not in
willful and material breach of this _Section 6.3_ with respect to such Third
Party, and (iii) the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)

be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may at any
time prior to 6:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stockholder Consent

 



40  Delivery Date, effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such

pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided to the Acquirors at least three (3)
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice (such period and any period commenced by a
new written notice delivered pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
6.3(d)(iii)_, the " _Notice Period_ ") of the CompanyÂ’s intention to take
such actions, which notice shall specify the basis for such Change of Board
Recommendation, the identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and shall
include a copy of the applicable Company Acquisition Agreement and any other
material documents with respect thereto;

 

(ii) during the Notice Period, if requested by the Acquirors, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have, engaged in
good faith negotiations with the Acquirors and their Representatives regarding
any amendments or modifications to this Agreement and/or the Real Estate
Purchase Agreement proposed by the Acquirors and intended to cause the
relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal;
and

(iii) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any proposed amendments or modifications to this
Agreement and/or the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, including a change to the
price terms hereof and thereof and the other agreements contemplated hereby
that may be offered by the Acquirors (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 6:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Notice Period
and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute, or result
in, a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect. In the event of any change to the price terms or any other material
revision or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal, then the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to the Acquirors and
to again comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.3(d)_ (which shall
apply _mutatis mutandis_ ) with respect to such new written notice.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to breach its fiduciary duties or violate applicable Law; or (iii)
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ that that in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), the
Company Board does not include any statement that itself would be a Change of
Board Recommendation.

(f) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ by any of Affiliates or its
their Representatives acting on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates shall
be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section 6.3_ by the Company.

 



41 Information Statement_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Company shall submit a form of irrevocable and unconditional written
consent to the Significant Stockholder, being the record holder of at least a
majority of the outstanding Company Shares (such written consent, as duly
executed and delivered by the Significant Stockholder, the " _Significant
Stockholder Consent_ "). Subject to _Section 8.1(e)_ of this Agreement and
the terms of the Voting Agreement, no later than 6:00 p.m., New York City

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Stockholder Consent Delivery Date
(and in any event within five (5) days of the date thereof), the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a written information statement of the
type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act containing the information
specified in Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act concerning the Significant

") and shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Information Statement
cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company and the Acquirors shall
furnish all information concerning such Person to the other as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Information Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
the Acquirors upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Information Statement and shall provide the Acquirors with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and the Acquirors shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide the Acquirors and their
respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and (ii) shall consider for inclusion in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by the Acquirors and their
respective counsel.

(c) The Company agrees that the Information Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of the information included or
incorporated by reference in the Information Statement will, at the date the
Information Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of
the Company, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company

 



42  with respect to statements made in the Information Statement based on
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the Acquirors specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. Each Acquiror agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of such information will, at
the date the Information Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If, at any time prior to the date that is twenty (20) days
after the Information Statement is first mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders,
any information relating to the Company, the Acquirors or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company or the Acquirors which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

(d) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Information
Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case as promptly as practicable after, and in any event
within two (2) days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from the SEC that
it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (ii) confirmation
from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed or
(iii) expiration of the ten (10) day period after filing in the event the SEC
does not review the Information Statement.

6.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain the Real
Estate Purchase Required Consents and all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities (including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act
and applicable Gaming Laws). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Acquirors, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates be obligated to take any action, including entering
into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that (i)
requires the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any material
assets or businesses of the Acquirors, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or any of their Subsidiaries, (ii) materially limits the conduct of the
Acquirors or their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Company and its Subsidiaries) or the AcquirorsÂ’ freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the
CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of the AcquirorsÂ’ or
their AffiliatesÂ’ other assets or businesses, or (iii) would be expected to
have an adverse impact in any material respect

 



43  on the Acquirors, their Affiliates and their SubsidiariesÂ’ respective
businesses, or the businesses to be acquired by the Acquirors pursuant to this
Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, taken as a whole. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that any action, including entering into
any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement, that would
require either Acquiror to divest or hold separate, or agree to divest or
hold separate, any casino owned by such Acquiror or by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement shall be considered
"material" for the purposes of the preceding sentence. With regard to
any Governmental Entity, the Company shall not, without the AcquirorsÂ’
written consent, which may be withheld by the Acquirors in their sole
discretion, take, or commit to take, any action inconsistent with the
limitations set forth in the preceding sentence. Nothing in this Agreement
shall require any party to take or agree to take any action with respect to
its business or operations in connection with obtaining all necessary actions
or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities (including, without limitation, those in connection with
the HSR Act and applicable Gaming Laws), unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Gamma shall have no obligation to take any
action or refrain from taking any action pursuant to this _Section 6.5(a)_ if
it obtains a legal opinion from a nationally recognized law firm that such
action or inaction would be reasonably likely to materially impair Gamma or
its direct or indirect owner from continuing to be treated as a real estate
investment trust under the Code; _provided_ , _however,_ that Gamma may not
be compelled to take any action or refrain from taking any action under any
other provision of this Agreement to the extent that Gamma is excused from
taking such action or refraining from taking such action by this sentence
and;  _provided_ , _further_ that Gamma will not be deemed to be in breach of
this Agreement solely due to its failure to take or refrain from taking such
action. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall
be deemed to limit any obligation the Acquirors may have to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information, outside counsel for the Company and
the Acquirors shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to the Company or either Acquiror, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to applications made with respect to Gaming
Approvals that include personal identifying information or other similarly
sensitive information (as reasonably determined by such party in good faith).
In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and the Acquirors
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and the Acquirors
shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating
to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing each such
other party with copies of notices or other written substantive communications
received by such party or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity and/or Third Party with respect to such transactions, and,
to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the other
party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any substantive filing, investigation or
other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



44 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and the Acquirors shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make
or cause to be made (i) all required HSR Act notifications within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, to the extent required, and
(ii) all applications and supporting documentation necessary to obtain all

to the Transactions (including, but not limited to, such requests with respect
to the HSR Act or Gaming Authorities), then such party shall in good faith
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other parties, a response which is, at a minimum, in
substantial compliance with such request.

 

6.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 8_ , unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the OTCQB (or any other

becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 7_ being incapable of satisfaction. The making of such a
notice (in and of itself) pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement and any failure to make such notice (in and of
itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions
set forth in _Article 7_ have been satisfied or give rise to any right of
termination set forth in _Article 8_.

6.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company, Gamma or Parent and Merger Sub shall issue any press release or
make any public statement with respect to the Transactions or this Agreement
or the Real Estate Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of
each other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable U.S. securities exchange, OTCQB or
Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect to
any press release or other public statement by the Company permitted by
_Section 6.3_. Each of the parties may issue a press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase
Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ , such press release shall not be issued prior

45 6.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the period ending on the date
that is six (6) months from the Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the
termination of such Continuing EmployeeÂ’s employment) except as otherwise
required pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Parent shall (i)
provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time who remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time (each a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") base compensation that is not less favorable than
the base compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) provide or cause ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to provide benefits (including target
annual cash bonus opportunity but excluding equity-based or equity-linked
compensation or benefits, and excluding any pension or other retiree benefits)
to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value that is
substantially comparable in the aggregate as such benefits provided to
similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
determined by Parent in its discretion.

(b) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals
(including any vacation and paid time off accruals), each Continuing
EmployeeÂ’s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as reflected
in the CompanyÂ’s records, shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation where length of service
is relevant; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized or credited (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) with respect to a newly
established plan for which prior service is not taken into account or with
respect to any equity based compensation, or (iii) if it results in benefit
accruals with respect to any defined benefit plan.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to take reasonable best efforts to, waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of
insurability, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees (and their covered family members) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to take
reasonable best efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments / co-insurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums
and similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or
her covered family members) during the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and out-of-
pocket maximum under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Continuing Employee (and family members) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time.

 



46 (d) Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Company, as applicable, shall cause:

 

(i) all incentive bonus amounts pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan for
Fiscal Year 2018 (" _MIP_ ") under the CompanyÂ’s Performance Incentive Plan

Committee after consultation with Parent and consistent with the terms of the
MIP) and paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice to participants in the MIP, but in no case later than March 15, 2019,
_provided_ that (x) the Target Bonus Percentage (as defined in the MIP) shall
be determined by the CompanyÂ’s management and Compensation Committee prior to
the Closing Date consistent with the terms of the MIP and past practice, and
(y) notwithstanding the terms of the MIP or the Incentive Plan to the
contrary, any participant in the MIP whose employment is terminated on or
following the Closing Date (A) by the Company, Merger Sub, Parent and their
Subsidiaries without "Cause" (as such term is defined in the CompanyÂ’s Change
in Control and Severance Plan (the " _CIC Plan_ "), without regard to whether
such participant is eligible to participate in the CIC Plan), (B) by the
participant for "Good Reason" (as defined in the CIC Plan), if such
participant is a participant in the CIC Plan, or (C) by the participant
(other than a participant who is a participant in the CIC Plan) for a reason
specified in _Section 6.8(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall
continue to be eligible to receive a payout under the MIP, with any such
payout amount to be determined based on actual performance results, and pro-
rated based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the
participant was employed by the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and
the denominator of which is 365;

(ii) all amounts pursuant to a long-term performance award (a " _Performance
Award_ ") under the Incentive Plan for the performance period commencing on
January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2018, (the " _2018 LTIP Cycle_ "),
to be determined (by the CompanyÂ’s Compensation Committee after consultation
with Parent and consistent with the terms of the Incentive Plan and the
applicable Performance Award Agreement) and paid to participants in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, but in no case
later than March 15, 2019, _provided_ that notwithstanding the terms of the
Performance Award or the Incentive Plan to the contrary, any Performance
Award participant whose employment is terminated on or following the Closing
Date (A) by the Company, Merger Sub, Parent and their Subsidiaries without
"Cause" (as such term is defined in the CIC Plan, without regard to whether
such participant is eligible to participate in the CIC Plan), (B) by the
participant for "Good Reason" (as defined in the CIC Plan), if such
participant is a participant in the CIC Plan, (C) by the participant (other
than a participant who is a participant in the CIC Plan) for a reason
specified in _Section 6.8(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, or (D) due
to a "Qualifying Event" (as defined in the Performance Award Agreement),
shall continue to be eligible to receive a payout of his or her Performance
Award for the 2018 LTIP Cycle, with any such payout amount to be determined
based on actual performance results for the 2018 LTIP Cycle, and pro-rated
based on the number of full calendar months the participant was employed by
the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries during
the 2018 LTIP Cycle, in accordance with the pro-ration formula set forth in
Section 7 of the Performance Award Agreement; and

(iii) pursuant to Section 9 of the Performance Awards for the performance
periods (x) commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019,
and (y) commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020 (each an
" _LTIP Cycle_ "), all amounts for such LTIP Cycles to be paid at or as soon
as reasonably practicable (in

 



47  connection with ordinary payroll cycles) following the Closing to each
participant thereof with respect to the applicable LTIP Cycle with the
participantÂ’s eligibility for such Performance Award determined by reference
to a pro-rated Performance Goal, as determined by the CompanyÂ’s Compensation
Committee immediately prior to the Closing Date after consultation with Parent
and consistent with the terms of the Incentive Plan and the applicable
Performance Award Agreement, which shall be calculated based on actual
performance results by multiplying the applicable Cumulative Operational
EBITDA target or Cumulative Property EBITDA target (each as set forth in the
Performance Award Agreement), as applicable, by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of completed full calendar months in the applicable LTIP
Cycle prior to the Closing and the denominator of which is thirty-six (36),
and with the payout amount with respect to any such Performance Award pro-
rated by multiplying the Actual Performance Award (as defined in the
Performance Award Agreement) by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of completed full calendar months in the applicable LTIP Cycle prior
to the Closing and the denominator of which is thirty-six (36). In connection
with, and as a condition to, the payment of a pro-rated Performance Award with
respect to any LTIP Cycle as contemplated by this  _Section 6.8(d)(iii)_,
the Performance Award shall be cancelled, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall have any
remaining obligations or liabilities thereunder whatsoever (including with
respect to any post-Closing portion of the applicable LTIP Cycle).

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the CompanyÂ’s 401(k)
plan(s), effective as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(f) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 9.9_, the provisions of
this _Section 6.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no current or former employee (including any Continuing
Employee), director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of
this _Section 6.8_ shall create such rights in any such individuals. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee
at any time and for any reason; (ii) subject to the actions required by
_Section 6.8(d)_, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to continue any Company Plan or other employee benefit
plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Plans or
other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 

(g) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall timely satisfy any required
notifications and/or consent requirements of any works councils or other
labor or employee organizations, as may be required under applicable Law or
any collective bargaining or similar labor agreement, in each case in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



48 6.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall
advance expenses as incurred ( _provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is
not entitled to indemnification for such matter), to the extent provided in
(i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents
of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
(ii) any indemnification Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in effect as of the date of this Agreement that is listed on _Section 6.9_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, to each present and former director and officer
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees
who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Plan (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees),
judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any act or
omission by such Indemnitee relating to his or her position with the Company
or its Subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
any indemnification Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 6.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than
six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor
of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
or similar Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect
as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement listed
on _Section 6.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained for the benefit of those persons that are directors and officers
of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the "
_D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy of the Company,
or, if substantially equivalent insurance

 



49  coverage is unavailable, the best coverage that is then available;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Nothing in this _Section 6.9(c)_ will require
Parent to duplicate coverages that have been procured by the Company prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper
provision to be made so that such successor or assignee shall expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
in any indemnification Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 6.9_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. From and after the Effective Time, the obligations
of Parent under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this  _Section 6.9_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 6.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

6.10 _Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions
necessary or advisable to cause Merger Sub to perform its covenants,
agreements and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement, approve
and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub
and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent
approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

 



50 6.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Gamma or Merger Sub, the Merger, the Real
Estate Purchase or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and/or
the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take all commercially reasonable actions as
may be necessary so the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and/or the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement and otherwise to render such Takeover Law
inapplicable to the this Agreement, the Merger, the Real Estate Purchase and
the other Transactions.

6.12  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and any other dispositions of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Shares) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give the Acquirors reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Disaffiliation Agreement,
the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, including the Merger, the Real Estate
Purchase and the Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), and no such
settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of the Acquirors (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly notify the
Acquirors of any Transaction Litigation and shall keep the Acquirors
reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof. 

6.14 _OTCQB Quotation and SEC Registration_. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to cause the Company Shares
to cease to be quoted on the OTCQB and to be deregistered under the Exchange
Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

 

6.15 _Actions for Real Estate Purchase_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, with

insuring that fee simple title to such Conveyed Property is vested in Gamma or
its designee subject only to the Permitted Liens, (ii) a Title Policy to
Gamma or its designee with respect to each Company Ground Leased Property,
insuring that leasehold title to such Company Ground Leased Property is vested
in Gamma or its designee subject only to the Permitted Liens, and (iii) a
Title Policy to each Propco which is the owner of a Propco Owned Property,
insuring that fee simple title to such Propco Owned Property is vested in such

Title Policy as Gamma may reasonably require, _provided_ that (A) such
endorsements (or amendments) shall be at no cost to, and shall impose no
additional liability on, the Company, (B) GammaÂ’s obligations under the Real

require and (ii) providing substitute guarantors that are reasonably
acceptable to the consenting party.

between any Propco, on the one hand, and the Company or any Subsidiary, on the
other hand, shall be settled at or prior to the Closing.

 

(e) The Company shall not make, or cause any Propco to make, any election to
treat a Propco as a corporation for U.S. federal or state income tax
purposes, and shall not agree to any proposed revaluation of any of the
properties by any taxing authority without the prior written consent of the
Acquirors.

 

(f) At the AcquirorsÂ’ option, the Acquirors may obtain an updated certified
ALTA survey with respect to each Company Real Property (the " _Updated

shall promptly and in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date notify Parent in writing of the amount of any such
Indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and expected to be outstanding on the
Closing Date), repayment in full of all obligations in respect of such
Indebtedness and release of any Liens securing such Indebtedness and
guarantees in connection therewith, in each case, on the Closing Date. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent no later
than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date payoff letters with
respect to the Company Credit Facility and, to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent in writing no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, any Indebtedness incurred by any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof in compliance with  _Section 6.1(b)(xi)_
(each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for transactions
of this type, from the persons, or the applicable agent on behalf of the
persons, to which such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letters together
with any related

 



53  release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount
and provide for Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection

Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, to be released and terminated. Upon

has determined, after reasonable consultation with Parent, that it will not at
the time of the Real Estate Purchase (and without giving effect to the
payment of the Real Estate Purchase Price or any other payment under this
Agreement) have sufficient unencumbered and available cash, net of "cage
cash", cash on hand required by any Governmental Entity, the reasonably
estimated additional amount of cash necessary to ensure the sound operation
of the CompanyÂ’s business consistent with past practice, and any other
restricted cash, to pay in full the outstanding Indebtedness in respect of the
Credit Facility, then to the extent of such shortfall Parent will extend an
unsecured loan to the Company on the day of the Closing so that, together with
such net unencumbered and available cash, the proceeds of such loan are
sufficient to pay in full the outstanding Indebtedness in respect of the
Credit Facility as may be necessary to release all Liens and obligations in
respect thereof at the time of, or immediately prior to, the Real Estate
Purchase, and the terms of such loan shall be reasonable for the circumstance
as negotiated in good faith by Parent and the Company.

6.18 _Financing; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives to provide to Parent, at ParentÂ’s sole expense,

applicable Law and does not materially interfere with the operations of the

Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) promptly to furnish
Parent with customary financial and other information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries including non-public and pro forma financial information

and other materials contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment; (iv) if,
in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on
Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material
nonpublic information which Parent in consultation with the Company
reasonably determines to include in a customary offering memorandum for the
Debt Financing, then the Company shall promptly file such Current Report on
Form 8-K, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with
the SEC for purposes of permitting such

 



54  information to be included in marketing materials or memoranda for the Debt
Financing (or any high yield bonds being issued in lieu of all or a portion of
the Debt Financing), (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary
accountantsÂ’ comfort letters (including providing any necessary management
representation letters), (vi) if requested by Parent, to cooperate with and
assist Parent in ParentÂ’s obtaining customary legal opinions, certificates,

information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

case, to receipt of funds from Parent sufficient to make such repayments); (x)
provide customary authorization letters to the Parent Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders (including

Required Information and to update any provided Required Information as may
be necessary for such Required Information to remain current and to satisfy
the requirements set forth in the definition of "Required Information"; (xii)
allow the Parent Financing Sources to have access to the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (xiii) consent to the
use of the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos to the extent customary in

used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under the provisions

otherwise to commit to take any action in connection therewith; (iv) provide
any cooperation, or take any action, that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Company to

 



55  breach any provision or fail to perform any of its obligations, or impede
the Company in the exercise of any of its rights, under this Agreement or
cause any condition to Closing set forth in  _Article 7_ to fail to be
satisfied; (v) cause any of their respective boards of directors (or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
under any documents or agreements related to the Debt Financing shall be

(c) Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and
against any and all damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with (i) the Debt Financing, (ii) any action

expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and the Subsidiaries
contemplated by this _Section 6.18_. Nothing contained in this _Section
6.18_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be
an issuer or guarantor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing. All non-public or other confidential information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent or its Representatives

and not in violation of this _Section 6.18_; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to such Debt Financing in such definitive
agreements; and (iii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letters
and any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing to the extent the
failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the amount or
timing of the

 



56  Debt Financing or the availability of the Debt Financing at the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , if Parent has raised through alternative sources (an
" _Alternative Financing_ ") funds sufficient to consummate the Transactions,
Parent shall have no obligation to arrange any such Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in such Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise
so long as (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of any such
Alternative Financing together with a written certificate to the Company that
the terms of _Section 4.3(a)(iv) _and _Section 4.8_ shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ to such Alternative Financing as if it were the Debt Financing and
(B) the terms of such Alternative Financing (x) are not materially less
favorable to Parent or the Company than the Debt Financing and (y) would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, or cause any delay in the
consummation of the Merger as compared to the Debt Financing. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing,
becomes unavailable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain promptly bridge financing,
alternative debt financing or equity financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to meet ParentÂ’s obligations to pay the Parent Merger
Consideration, refinance any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and pay all fees and expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, it is understood and agreed that reasonable best efforts of
Parent contemplated by this _Section 6.18(d)_ shall be deemed to require
Parent to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing, as
applicable, in a timely and diligent manner.

 

(e) Except as provided elsewhere in this _Section 6.18_, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from entering into agreements relating
to the Debt Financing or the operation of Parent or, as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation, including adding equity providers or operating
partners (so long as any such agreements or entering into such agreements
would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or delay the
Closing (including with respect to approvals required in connection therewith
under any applicable Gaming Laws)).

 

(f) Without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not
be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld, Parent shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing Commitment if such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement would reasonably be expected to (i)
delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) modify the conditions contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment (the " _Debt Financing Conditions_ ") or create any
new condition to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing, as
applicable (other than the Debt Financing Conditions as in effect on the date
hereof), (iii) reduce the net cash proceeds of the Debt Financing, including
any reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing, (iv)
change the date for termination and/or expiration of the Debt Financing
Commitment to an earlier date or (v) adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment
prior to the Closing. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
Parent shall not permit any assignment of rights or obligations under the Debt
Financing Commitment or consent to the addition of additional lenders or
agents if such addition would permit a reduction in the amount of the Debt
Financing Commitment of the Lender, _provided_ that the Lender may syndicate
the Debt Financing so long as the Lender

 



57  retains and remains obligated to fund its commitment under the Debt
Financing until the Debt Financing is fully funded by the designated assignees
and the syndicated sources of funding for the Debt Financing. Parent shall
promptly provide the Company written notice of any amendment or modification
relating to the Debt Financing Commitment that does not require consent
pursuant to this _Section 6.18(f)_.

 

(g) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice: (i) of the receipt of
any written notice from any party to the Debt Financing Commitment with
respect to any actual material breach, default, withdrawal, termination or
repudiation of any provisions of any Debt Financing Commitment by such party,
and (ii) if for any reason any portion of the Debt Financing actually becomes
unavailable on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment _provided_ that neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant
to this sentence to the extent that (x) such information is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege (but only if such privilege is asserted
in good faith) or (y) the disclosure of which would be prohibited or
restricted by applicable Law.

(h) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Acquirors as soon
as possible, and in any event within twenty (20) days after the end of each
quarter, a Company-prepared unaudited balance sheet and statement of income
for the quarter then-ended, prepared in accordance with GAAP, excluding any
related notes thereto and subject to normal period-end adjustments.

6.19 _Actions with Respect to Real Estate Purchase Required Consents_. In
addition to the CompanyÂ’s obligations as set forth in _Section 6.5(a)_, the
Company shall take the actions set forth in _Section 6.19_ of the Company

action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors (or

extent that any amendment, modification or supplement to the provisions which
the Parent Financing Sources under the Debt Financing are expressly

Agreement which decreases the Aggregate Merger Consideration, other than as
explicitly contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
adjustment in respect of the Aruba Operations, or which adversely affects the
rights of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders hereunder without the Company
Stockholder Approval. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by

 



64  the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

Company Disclosure Letter, no breach of any Ancillary Agreement to be entered
into between the Company and Gamma after the date of this Agreement shall be

liability or indemnification obligation arising from fraud. Without limiting
the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent, Gamma and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees that no other party to this Agreement or the Real Estate Purchase
Agreement makes any representation or warranty with respect to (a) any
financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating such party, any of such partyÂ’s Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or (b) any oral or written information presented by such other
party or any of their respective Representatives in the course of their due
diligence investigation, the negotiation of this Agreement or the course
of the Transactions.

9.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action based upon, arising out
of or in connection herewith shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws
that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; _provided_
, _however_ ,

 



84  each of the parties hereto (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) agrees
that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether based
upon contract, tort or otherwise) to which a Parent Financing Source is a
party and that is in any way related to the Commitment Letter, this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing, or the Debt Financing Commitment, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction, _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any matter to which a Parent
Financing Source is a party that is related to a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the interpretation of representations and warranties under this
Agreement, or the consummation of the Acquiror Transactions in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have
jurisdiction, any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States
of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such
courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be
heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court. Each of the
parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 9.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that (x) it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against any of the Parent Financing Sources in any way relating
to this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without limitation, any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing Commitment or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York (and the
appellate courts thereof), and (y) that the provisions of _Section 9.11(c)_
(relating to the waiver of jury trial) shall apply to any such action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim, and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in

 



85  tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter, Debt Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof or the Debt Financing contemplated thereby.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARENT FINANCING SOURCES, THE COMMITMENT LETTER,
THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT AND/OR THE DEBT FINANCING IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH ,THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, THE PARENT FINANCING SOURCES, THE
COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT AND/OR THE DEBT FINANCING.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.11(c)_.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.13 _Remedies; Joint and Several Liability; Specific Performance_. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will
be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred
hereby, or at Law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party
of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. All
obligations of each of Parent and Gamma for monetary damages (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not for equitable relief) under this Agreement and the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement are joint and several. The parties agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform
their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement and the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such

 



86  provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, on the understanding that
termination pursuant to  _Section 8.1(d)_ by the party against which
specific performance is sought shall not be deemed "valid" for purposes of
this _Section 9.13_, the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and the
Acquiror Transactions (including the obligation of Company, Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger, and the obligation of Company or Gamma to
consummate the Real Estate Purchase, or the obligations of the parties to
consummate the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Real Estate Purchase Agreement if such party is required to do so hereunder
or thereunder), in each case without posting a bond or other undertaking, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at Law
or in equity. The pursuit of specific performance by any party at any time
will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled. If a court of
competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations
of the Acquirors and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions pursuant to a
claim for specific performance brought against the Acquirors and Merger Sub,
and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach, the
Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach on
behalf of its stockholders. The parties acknowledge that the provisions
contained in this _Section 9.13_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Company and constitute a material inducement to
the Company to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing Commitment under
the terms thereof, none of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
or its and their direct and indirect stockholders shall have any rights or
claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Parent
Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.

9.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties hereto agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that no Non-Recourse Party of
such parties shall have any liability under this Agreement.

 

9.15 _Financing Source Matters_. Each of the parties hereto agree that the
Parent Financing Sources shall not have any liability or obligation (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute or
otherwise) to the Company, its Affiliates or any of their respective equity
holders or representatives for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever arising under, out of, in
connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise)
or breach; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 9.15_ shall limit the
liability or obligations of the Parent Financing Sources to Parent (and its
successors and assigns) and/or the other parties to the Debt Financing under
the Debt Financing Commitment (or any fee letters referred to therein).
