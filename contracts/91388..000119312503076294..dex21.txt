representations and warranties made herein, on the Closing Date Sellers will
sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and
accept from Sellers, all of Sellers\' right, title and interest in and to the
assets set forth on Exhibit A hereto, wherever   12    located, whether

"Transferred Assets"), but not including any Excluded Assets.   "AS IS"
TRANSACTION. BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, SELLERS MAKE NO (AND SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
AND NEGATE ANY) REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WRITTEN OR ORAL,
STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS OR ANY
OTHER MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCOME TO BE
DERIVED OR EXPENSES TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS,
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF ANY PART OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS OR ANY OTHER
ASSET WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF ANY LEASE OR CONTRACT TO BE ASSUMED BY BUYER AT
THE CLOSING, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OR OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE
PHYSICAL CONDITION OF ANY REAL ESTATE OWNED BY SELLERS OR WHICH ARE THE
SUBJECT OF ANY REAL PROPERTY LEASE TO BE ASSUMED BY BUYER AT THE CLOSING, THE
ZONING OF ANY SUCH REAL ESTATE, THE VALUE OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS (OR ANY
PORTION THEREOF), THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS, THE TERMS,
AMOUNT, VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY ASSUMED LIABILITIES, THE TITLE OF
THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF), THE MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE TRANSFERRED
ASSETS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY OTHER MATTER OR THING RELATING TO
THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS OR ANY PORTION THEREOF. WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING
THE FOREGOING, SELLERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AS TO ANY PORTION OF
THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS. BUYER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BUYER HAS CONDUCTED
AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE
TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND ALL SUCH OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OR AFFECTING THE
TRANSFERRED ASSETS AS BUYER DEEMED NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE AND THAT IN
PROCEEDING WITH ITS ACQUISITION OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR ANY
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, BUYER IS DOING SO
BASED SOLELY UPON SUCH INDEPENDENT INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS.
ACCORDINGLY, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER
WILL ACCEPT THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AT THE CLOSING "AS IS," "WHERE IS," AND
"WITH ALL FAULTS."   2.2 Liabilities. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees that, on and as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall assume from Sellers and thereafter pay, perform or discharge in
accordance with their terms the following obligations and liabilities of
Sellers (collectively called the "Assumed Liabilities"): (a) the obligations
of Sellers under the executory contracts and unexpired leases specifically
described on Exhibit B hereto (the "Executory Contracts") that, by the terms
of such Executory Contracts, arise after the Effective Time, relate to
periods following the Effective Time and are to be observed, paid,
discharged, or   13    performed, as the case may be, in each case at
any time after the Effective Time, which obligations shall not include such
amounts for which either Seller is responsible as provided in this Agreement,
and (b) the other obligations and liabilities of Sellers specifically
described on Exhibit B hereto which are to be observed, paid, discharged or
performed, as the case may be, at any time after the Effective Time.  
Sellers shall, however, be solely and exclusively responsible for the payment
of any Cure Amounts due with respect to any Executory Contracts listed on
Exhibit B, and shall (i) pay all undisputed Cure Amounts with respect to
such Executory Contracts on the Closing Date, (ii) contest by appropriate
proceedings (as determined by Sellers) all disputed Cure Amounts with respect
to such Executory Contracts, and (iii) after resolution of any related
dispute, pay the disputed Cure Amounts in accordance with the Bankruptcy
Court\'s order with respect thereto. Buyer shall pay on the Closing Date and
shall be solely and exclusively responsible for the payment of all costs and
penalties attributable or associated with rejection of any executory
contracts and unexpired leases to which either of Sellers is a party
specifically designated as such on Exhibit C hereto (the "Rejected
Contracts"); provided, however, that Buyer\'s liability shall in no event
exceed the amount payable to counterparties to Rejected Contracts under the
Bankruptcy Code or the terms of any plan of reorganization or liquidating
plan in the Sellers\' Bankruptcy Cases, plus any costs and expenses of
Sellers relating to the rejection of such Rejected Contracts. For example, in
the event a counterparty to a Rejected Contract has an allowed claim for
rejection damages in the Sellers\' Bankruptcy Cases for $1 million, but
the Sellers\' plan of reorganization provides for a dividend payment of 10%
for unsecured claims (including rejection damage claims), then Buyer shall
be required to pay only $100,000 to such counterparty (and not $1 million),
plus any costs and expenses of Sellers in resolving such counterparty\'s
claim. Buyer shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Sellers from and
against all loss, liability, damages, costs and expense (including
attorney\'s fees) arising out of, in connection with or related to (i)
rejection of the Rejected Contracts (pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity
Agreement attached as Exhibit I), (ii) the Assumed Liabilities, (iii) the
ownership or operation of the Transferred Assets after the Closing Date, (iv)
any breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
Buyer hereunder, and (v) any actions, causes of action or proceedings related
to clauses (i) - (iv) of this grammatical paragraph of Section 2.2.   Buyer
shall not assume, or in any way be liable or responsible for, any other
Liabilities of Sellers which are not specifically assumed herein, and such
Liabilities shall be and remain the Liabilities of Sellers to pay
and/or discharge.   2.3 Excluded Assets. The Transferred Assets only
include those assets specifically listed on Exhibit A and shall not include
any other assets of Sellers, including without limitation, the following
(hereinafter collectively called the "Excluded Assets"):   (a) any cash on
hand, in banks, and any cash equivalents;   (b) any right, title or interest
in or to any licenses,  trademarks (other than the "Farmland" trademark, the
"Carando" trademark,  and the "Proud to be Farmer Owned" trademark), patents,
patent rights,  copyrights, or trade names (other than the trade name
"Farmland" and the  trade name "Carando") owned or licensed by Sellers,
to   14     the extent such assets relate primarily to any businesses or
operations  affiliated with Industries other than the Business;   (c) all
claims, rights and causes of action of the Sellers  arising under or relating
to Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code (whether or  not asserted as of the
Closing Date), including, without limitation, any  such claims and actions
arising under Sections 544, 545, 547, 548, 549 or  551 of the Bankruptcy
Code;   (d) Sellers\' rights under this Agreement and all cash and  non-
cash consideration payable or deliverable to Sellers pursuant to the  terms
and provisions hereof;   (e) all insurance proceeds, claims and causes of
action of any  kind (including, without limitation, proceeds paid or payable
in connection  with the fire at the Albert Lea, Minnesota facility), all
unearned  insurance premiums, and all accrued insurance refunds or rebates,
but  excepting casualty insurance proceeds or claims with respect to the 
Transferred Assets relating to casualty losses occurring on or after the 
date of the Original Agreement;   (f) any contract (including all insurance
policies of Sellers  other than the insurance contracts assigned to Buyer
pursuant to Section  7.2(e) of this Agreement, and including any post-
petition contracts) to  which either Seller is a party that is not listed or
described on Exhibit B  as an Executory Contract;   (g) all securities,
whether capital stock or debt, of any  entity;   (h) all rights and claims
in or to any refunds or credits of  or with respect to any Taxes, assessments
or similar charges paid by or on  behalf of Sellers, in each case to the
extent applicable to any period  prior to the Closing (but not any of the
foregoing paid by any entity  comprising Buyer); provided, however, Sellers
shall not take any action to  seek any refund of any tax or other payment
described in this clause (h)  that would impair or impede Buyer\'s ability to
operate the Business  post-Closing in the manner in which Sellers operate the
Business as of the  date hereof or would give rise to any Encumbrance on the
Transferred Assets  following the Closing;   (i) tax records, minute books,
stock transfer books and  corporate seal of Sellers, and any other books and
records relating to the  Excluded Assets;   (j) all claims arising on or
prior to the Closing Date under  any directors and officers liability
insurance policies owned by Sellers;   (k) all claims and causes of action
arising on or before the  Closing Date that Sellers have against any
Affiliate, insider of either  Seller or any third party (and any recovery on
account thereof), except to  the extent that such claims or causes of action
(i) may constitute a  counterclaim, defense, offset, or recoupment right with
respect to  affirmative claims (if any) that such third party may assert
against Buyer,  (ii) arise under the Warranties, the Executory Contracts
assumed and  assigned to Buyer, or the Licenses assigned to Buyer, or (iii)
expressly  relate to the Transferred Assets reflected in the Final  
15     Net Working Capital Calculation; provided, however, nothing in this
clause  (k) shall in any event be deemed to eliminate from the Excluded
Assets any  asset expressly designated as such pursuant to this Section
2.3;   (l) professional retainers paid by Sellers;   (m) any letters of
credit or similar financial accommodations  issued to any third party(ies)
for the account of Sellers;   (n) all deposits held by third parties;  
(o) those assets in the Pension Plan which are not assumed by  Buyer in
accordance with Section 2.4 of this Agreement; and   (p) those assets, if
any, listed on Exhibit C.   Buyer expressly agrees and understands that
Sellers shall not sell, assign, transfer, convey or deliver to Buyer any of
the Excluded Assets.   2.4 Pension Plan Assignment and Assumption. On the
Closing Date, Sellers shall cause to be transferred and assigned to Buyer,
and Buyer shall accept, adopt and assume, sponsorship of the Pension Plan and
all of the liabilities and obligations of Sellers thereunder, including but
not limited to the funding of accrued benefits (whether or not vested) for
all individuals entitled to such benefits. Pursuant to the foregoing, Sellers
and Buyer shall take such action as shall be necessary to amend the Pension
Plan, and the trust that is a part thereof, to substitute Smithfield or an
Affiliate thereof, as the sponsor and employer maintaining the Pension Plan
and such trust, with all the rights and authority of Sellers thereunder.
Sellers shall cause to be delivered to Buyer such information or data as
Buyer shall reasonably require in connection with Buyer\'s assumption of the
Pension Plan and the administration thereof. Buyer shall be responsible for
preparing and filing all reports, notices and related documents for the
Pension Plan due after the Closing Date.  SECTION 3. DEPOSIT AND PURCHASE
PRICE.  ---------------------------   3.1 Deposit. On the first (1st) day
after the date of the Original Agreement (and as an express condition to the
effectiveness of this Agreement, time being of the essence), Buyer shall
establish with JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Escrow Agent"), a joint order escrow
account (the "Deposit Escrow Account") in an amount equal to $35,000,000 (the
"Deposit"), which Deposit shall be earnest money and which Deposit shall be
held pursuant to an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (the "Deposit Escrow Agreement"). An amount equal to
$15,000,000 of the Deposit shall be designated the "HSR Deposit." Interest
accruing on the Deposit shall become part of the Deposit for all purposes
under this Agreement. If Closing occurs, then Buyer and Sellers shall cause
the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit to Sellers as part of the Purchase
Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
Sellers shall designate in accordance with Section 3.3 of this Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated, the Deposit shall be released in accordance
with Section 13 of this Agreement.   16     3.2 The Purchase Price and
Allocation. The Purchase Price for the Transferred Assets shall be an amount
equal to $457,400,000, minus the amount of $90,000,000 in respect of Buyer\'s
acceptance, adoption, assumption and sponsorship of the Pension Plan pursuant
to Section 2.4 hereof, plus the amount, if any, by which the Final Net
Working Capital Calculation exceeds $161,370,000 or minus the amount, if any,
by which the Final Net Working Capital Calculation is less than $161,370,000,
minus (but without duplication with respect to any amounts included in the
Final Net Working Capital Calculation) (a) the outstanding balance of
principal and accrued interest as of the Closing Date under any industrial
development bond indebtedness, if any, included among the Assumed Liabilities
and (b) the amount of the obligations of Sellers under any capitalized leases
included among the Assumed Liabilities (as capitalized on Sellers\' balance
sheet in accordance with GAAP) (collectively, the "Purchase Price"). The
Purchase Price shall be allocated to the various Transferred Assets as set
forth on Exhibit A for tax purposes and neither party shall take any contrary
position regarding such allocation in any tax filing or contest.   3.3
Payment of the Closing Purchase Price. At least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth
Sellers\' good faith estimate of the Final Net Working Capital Calculation
(which shall include Sellers\' prorated charges and other items described in
Section 4.3 hereof as of the Closing Date) prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Exhibit F (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Calculation"),
and an estimate of the Purchase Price based thereon (the "Closing Purchase
Price"). At the Closing, Buyer shall make a cash payment (the
"Closing Payment") to the Sellers in the amount equal to the Closing Purchase
Price minus an amount equal to the Deposit, such cash payment to be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Sellers shall
designate. At the Closing, the Escrow Agent shall transfer an amount equal to
the amount held in the Deposit Escrow Account to the Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account as Sellers shall
designate.   3.4 Final Net Working Capital Calculation. A post-
closing adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price shall be made as
follows:   (a) Within forty-five (45) days following the Closing, Buyer 
shall deliver to Sellers a statement setting forth in detail Buyer\'s 
calculation of the Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to 
this Section 3.4 and Exhibit F, the "Final Net Working Capital 
Calculation").   (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide 
Sellers with access to the books and records and knowledgeable personnel of 
the Business during normal business hours in connection with the  preparation
and review of the Final Net Working Capital Calculation.  Sellers shall have
the right to examine and make copies of the work papers  and such other
documents that are generated or reviewed by Buyer in  connection with the
preparation of the Final Net Working Capital  Calculation and to observe the
work performed by Buyer or its  representatives in connection with a physical
inventory to be conducted at  all plant locations related to the Business
following the Closing. The  Final Net Working Capital Calculation delivered
by Buyer to Sellers shall  become final for all purposes of this Agreement
unless, within thirty (30)  days after the receipt of such calculation by
Sellers (the "Settlement  Date"), Buyer receives written   17    
notice of Sellers\' disapproval of the Final Net Working Capital Calculation 
delivered by Buyer along with Sellers\' determination of the Final Net 
Working Capital Calculation, consistent with the terms of this Section 3.4, 
and a detailed description as to the reasons for such disapproval (the 
"Adjustment Report").   (c) In the event Sellers and Buyer fail to agree on
one or  more of Sellers\' proposed adjustments contained in the Adjustment
Report  within fifteen (15) days after Buyer\'s receipt of the Adjustment
Report,  then Sellers and Buyer will select, within five (5) days of the
expiration  of the foregoing fifteen (15) day period, a mutually
acceptable,  independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing
(the  "Independent Auditors"), to make the final determination with respect
to  the correctness of the proposed adjustments in the Adjustment Report. 
Within three (3) Business Days of the selection of the Independent  Auditors,
Sellers and Buyer will each submit to the Independent Auditors a  written
statement setting forth such party\'s proposed aggregate resolution  of the
proposed adjustments and any supporting data and analysis. Within  thirty
(30) days of the later submittal to the Independent Auditors, the 
Independent Auditors will select either Sellers\' or Buyer\'s proposed 
aggregate resolution of the proposed adjustments. If any unresolved 
objections are submitted to the Independent Auditors for resolution as 
provided above, the party whose proposed resolution is not selected by the 
Independent Auditors shall pay the fees and expenses of the Independent 
Auditors. The decision of the Independent Auditors shall be final and 
binding on Sellers and Buyer.   (d) On the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers
shall establish  with JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Working Capital Escrow
Agent") at the  Closing interest-bearing joint order escrow accounts (the
"Working Capital  Escrow Accounts"), in an aggregate amount equal to
$15,000,000 (the  "Working Capital Escrow"). The Working Capital Escrow shall
be held  pursuant to escrow agreements, both in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit  E (collectively, the "Working Capital Escrow Agreement"). Buyer
shall  jointly execute with Sellers the Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow
Agreement  and Buyer shall deposit, in good and current funds on the Closing
Date, the  sum of $7,500,000 in the Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow Account
as its  share of the Working Capital Escrow. Sellers shall jointly execute
with  Buyer the Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow Agreement and Sellers
shall  deposit, in good and current funds on the Closing Date, the sum of 
$7,500,000 in the Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow Account as their share of 
the Working Capital Escrow. Interest on the Working Capital Escrow shall 
become part of the Working Capital Escrow for all purposes under this 
Agreement. Interest allocable to the portion of the Working Capital Escrow 
in Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow Account shall accrue and shall be held in 
Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow Account, and interest allocable to the 
portion of the Working Capital Escrow in Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow 
Account shall accrue and shall be held in Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow 
Account. To the extent that the Final Net Working Capital Calculation is 
greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Calculation, Buyer shall owe 
such difference to Sellers, which difference shall first be paid in 
immediately available funds on the Payment Date by the Working Capital 
Escrow Agent out of the funds in Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow Account, 
and if such difference shall exceed the balance of funds (including 
interest) in Buyer\'s Working Capital Escrow Account,   18     then
Buyer shall pay the remainder of such difference owing to Sellers in 
immediately available funds on the Payment Date. To the extent that the 
Final Net Working Capital Calculation is less than the Estimated Net  Working
Capital Calculation, Sellers shall owe such difference to Buyer,  which
difference shall first be paid in immediately available funds on the  Payment
Date by the Working Capital Escrow Agent out of funds in Sellers\'  Working
Capital Escrow Account, and if such difference shall exceed the  balance of
funds (including interest) in Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow  Account, then
Sellers shall pay the remainder of such difference to Buyer  in immediately
available funds on the Payment Date. All payments made by or  for the account
of Buyer to Sellers or by or for the account of Sellers to  Buyer pursuant to
this Section 3.4(d) shall be accompanied by accrued  interest thereon from
the Closing Date at the rate of 6% per annum.  Immediately following the
foregoing payments on the Payment Date, the  Working Capital Escrow Agent
shall release and pay over to Sellers the  remaining balance, if any, then
held in Sellers\' Working Capital Escrow  Account, and the Working Capital
Escrow Agent shall release and pay over to  Buyer the remaining balance, if
any, then held in Buyer\'s Working Capital  Escrow Account, all in accordance
with the Working Capital Escrow  Agreement. For purposes of this Section
3.4(d), "Payment Date" means the  third Business Day following (i) the
Settlement Date, in the event that  Sellers do not provide notice of
disapproval to Buyer pursuant to Section  3.4(b) of this Agreement, (ii) the
date that the Independent Auditors  provide notice to Buyer and Sellers of
their determination in accordance  with Section 3.4(c) of this Agreement, in
the event that Sellers provide  notice of disapproval to Buyer pursuant to
Section 3.4(b) of this  Agreement, or (iii) the date Sellers and Buyer agree
in writing on the  resolution of Sellers\' proposed adjustments, in the event
that Sellers  provide notice of disapproval to Buyer pursuant to Section
3.4(b) of this  Agreement.  SECTION 4. CLOSING.  --------   4.1 Closing
Date. The Closing shall take place at the office of Bryan Cave LLP, 1200
Main, Suite 3500, Kansas City, Missouri, at 10:00 a.m. (Missouri time) on the
date of entry of the Approval Order, or if not reasonably practicable on such
date then within two (2) Business Days thereafter, or, if later, on that date
which is two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction of those conditions to
the obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 9.5 and 10.3 of this
Agreement (but not, in any event, beyond the Outside Date) (the "Closing
Date"); provided, however, that if, on the Closing Date, there is then in
effect any suspension or material limitation on trading generally on
the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq
National Market, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities
settlement or clearance services in the United States, or a general
moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal, state
or other relevant authorities, then Buyer shall have the option to extend the
Closing Date by up to seven (7) days until the first Business Day upon which
such condition no longer exists (but not, in any event, beyond the Outside
Date) by giving written notice to Sellers, it being understood that if, at
the end of such period such condition is still in effect and the conditions
to Closing set forth in Sections 9 and 10 hereof are otherwise satisfied or
waived, then Buyer shall be obligated to close notwithstanding the pendency
of such condition and Buyer\'s failure to so close shall result in Buyer\'s
forfeiture of the Deposit under Section 13.4 of this Agreement. Subject to
the provisions of Section 13 of this Agreement, failure to consummate the
purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement on   19    the Closing
Date will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not
relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.   4.2 Transfer of
Assets. At the Closing, effective as of 10:00 a.m. (Missouri Time) on the
Closing Date (the "Effective Time"):   (a) Sellers shall sell, assign,

policies and commitments (collectively, the "Title Information")  and surveys
(collectively, the "Surveys") described on Disclosure Schedule,  Section 5.3
with respect to the Real Estate owned or leased by Sellers and  used in the
operation of the Business. The Title Information and Surveys  cover portions
of such Real Estate reflected therein and, to the Knowledge  of Sellers,
reflect the status of Sellers\' title to such portions of such  Real Estate
as of the date of each individual document comprising the Title  Information

requirements of the Leases, (ii) to Sellers\' Knowledge, no event  has
occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse  of

availability of equitable remedies (provided, however,  that Sellers do
hereby represent to Buyer that there are no orders that  have been entered in

Lease have received all  approvals of Governmental Authorities (including

domain proceeding that would  result in the taking of all or any material
part of any of the Real Estate  owned by Sellers and used in the operation of
the Business or, to the  Knowledge of Sellers, leased by Sellers and used in
the operation of the  Business or that would prevent or hinder, in material
respects, the  continued use of any of such Real Estate as currently being

Exhibit A or  Disclosure Schedule, Section 5.3 and except as would not be
expected to  have a Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of Sellers
there are no  structural defects relating to any of the improvements
comprising part of  such Real Estate, subject to normal wear and tear,
obsolescence, and  casualty, if any. Except as set forth on Exhibit A or
Disclosure Schedule,  Section 5.3, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no default or

except as would  not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of  Sellers, all facilities located on such Real Estate have
received all  approvals of Governmental Authorities (including Property
Permits) required  in connection with the operation of the Business and have

utilities necessary  for the operation of such facilities, including, where
appropriate, gas,  electricity, water, telephone, sanitary sewer and storm
sewer, which  utilities are provided via public roads or via appurtenant
easements  benefiting such Real Estate, except where the failure to have
such  utilities or such access to such utilities would not be expected to
have a  Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Sellers, the Real Estate
owned  by Sellers and used in the operation of the Business or leased by
Sellers  and used in the operation of the Business abuts on and has direct
vehicular  access to a public road, or has access to a public road via an

Bankruptcy Case. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
contingent upon the approval and authorization of the Bankruptcy Court, and
Sellers shall have no liability under this Agreement unless and until such
approval and authorization shall be given by the Bankruptcy Court. Sellers
have previously filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Sale Motion seeking entry
of the Approval Order. Each of Sellers and Buyer agree that they will
cooperate in promptly taking such actions as may be reasonably necessary to
obtain the Approval Order, including providing notice of the sale to such
additional parties as may be reasonably necessary, as well as furnishing
affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy
Court for the purposes, among others, of (a) providing necessary assurances
of performance by Buyer under this Agreement, including for the assumption of
any Contracts or Leases, (b) demonstrating that adequate notice has been
given to all necessary parties for the assumption and assignment to Buyer of
any Contracts or Leases under this Agreement, (c) demonstrating that the
Purchase Price under the Agreement constitutes reasonably equivalent
value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code for the Transferred
Assets, and (d) demonstrating that Buyer (i) is a "good faith" purchaser
under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) has not engaged in any
conduct that would cause or permit the Agreement to be avoided under Section
363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) is not a "successor" to any of the
Sellers for purposes of any successor liability laws. Unless and until this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Buyer shall not,
without the prior written consent of Sellers, file, join in, or otherwise
support in any manner whatsoever any motion or other pleading relating to the
sale of the Transferred Assets hereunder. In the event the Approval Order is
appealed, Sellers and Buyer shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such appeal, provided that Buyer and Sellers
shall proceed with the Closing despite the pendency of an appeal if no stay
of the Approval Order is in effect.   33    7.2 Sellers\' Employees.  
(a) Subject to Smithfield\'s standard drug/alcohol employment  screening,
physical examination, and background inquiry practices, as of  the Closing
Date Buyer will offer to employ (for positions substantially  similar to
their current employment positions), all employees employed by  Sellers
specifically in connection with the Transferred Assets, including  all
employees of Farmland Foods, Inc. (the "Foods Employees"). No less than 
thirty (30) days prior to Closing, Sellers shall identify to Buyer the  Foods
Employees and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to  assure that
Buyer may offer employment to any or all Foods Employees.  Except as provided
in Section 2.4 or in this Section 7.2, Buyer shall not  be obligated to adopt
or maintain any particular employee benefit plan or  plans for any Foods
Employees actually hired by Buyer. Buyer shall defend,  indemnify and hold
Sellers harmless from any liability under the WARN Act  or any similar state
law to the extent such liability arises out of or  relates to a reduction in
force in which a majority of the employee  terminations occur prior to or on
the Closing Date as a result of Buyer\'s  decision not to offer employment
based on Smithfield\'s standard  drug/alcohol employment screening, physical
examination, and background  inquiry practices or subsequent to the Closing
Date. Sellers shall defend,  indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any
liability under the WARN Act or  any similar state law to the extent such
liability arises out of or relates  to a reduction in force in which a
majority of the employee terminations  occur on or prior to the Closing Date
unless as a result of Buyer\'s  decision not to offer employment based on
Smithfield\'s standard  drug/alcohol employment screening, physical
examination, and background  inquiry practices. Buyer shall provide Sellers a
list of those Foods  Employees who accept such employment offer ("Hired
Employees"). Such offers  of employment will be conditioned upon Closing and
upon the termination of  such Foods Employees\' employment with Sellers
immediately prior to the  Effective Time.   (b) The Hired Employees will
become Buyer\'s employees  immediately following the Effective Time, and at
the Closing Date Buyer  will become responsible for wages, salary, benefits
and other compensation  with respect to the Hired Employees arising out of
employment with Buyer.   (c) Sellers shall cause the termination of
employment of the  Foods Employees as of the Closing, shall provide such
notice of termination  if and as required by the WARN Act or any similar
state Law, and shall  comply with all other Applicable Laws related to such
termination of  employment.   (d) Except as specifically provided in this
Section 7.2,  Sellers shall retain responsibility for, and shall indemnify
Buyer from and  against, all damage or liabilities arising in connection with
Sellers\'  employment of its employees (including all Foods Employees and
Hired  Employees) and the termination of their employment, including
without  limitation any penalties or damages under the WARN Act or any
similar state  Law. Sellers shall be responsible for providing continuation
coverage under  ERISA Sections 601 et seq. ("COBRA") with respect to their
employees (other  than Foods Employees, Hired Employees, or any individual
formerly employed  by Sellers in connection with the Transferred Assets,
collectively referred  to as "COBRA   34     Transferees") and their
qualified beneficiaries with respect to qualifying  events occurring on or
before the Closing Date. On and after the Closing  Date, Buyer shall be
responsible for providing COBRA coverage with respect  to the COBRA
Transferees and their qualified beneficiaries with respect to  all qualifying
events including those occurring on or before the Closing  Date.   (e)
Sellers and Sellers\' 401(k) savings plan or plans shall  retain
responsibility for all assets and liabilities under such plan(s) as  held in
trust on behalf of plan participants and their beneficiaries. Buyer  shall
assume sponsorship of all medical, dental, life, vision, ADandD;,  cafeteria,
short-term disability, and long-term disability plans listed in  Disclosure
Schedule, Section 7.2, in connection with which Sellers shall  assign and
Buyer shall assume all insurance contracts, administrative  service
agreements and other contracts related to such plans, including  those listed
in Disclosure Schedule, Section 7.2. It is understood that  Buyer may
terminate said plans consistent with such insurance contracts and 
administrative service agreements. To the extent Sellers are transferring 
any long-term disability plans to Buyer, Sellers represent and warrant that 
all Hired Employees, or any other employees of Sellers who are in pay  status
under said long-term disability plan(s), or who have otherwise  incurred a
disability to be covered under the long-term disability  plans(s), as of or
prior to the Closing Date, are either insured through a  third party
insurance company or will be accrued for in full in the Final  Net Working
Capital Calculation.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 2.4 and this
Section 7.2,  Sellers shall retain sponsorship of all of Sellers\' employee
benefit plans  and shall retain all responsibility for administration and
funding of the  those plans, including, but not limited to, all reporting and
disclosure  requirements.   (g) All of the Hired Employees will be
permitted to enroll in  all of Buyer\'s and Smithfield\'s plans applicable to
the Hired Employees in  accordance with the terms and conditions of such
plans as in effect from  time to time.   (h) At the Closing, Buyer and
Smithfield shall waive or cause  the waiver of waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, and other  limitations on participation otherwise
applicable to any Hired Employee and  their qualified dependents (who were
covered by an employee benefit plan of  Sellers and immediately elects to be
covered by a similar employee benefit  plan of Buyer or Smithfield) under or
with respect to all employee benefit  plans maintained by Buyer or Smithfield
which cover the Hired Employee,  provided the Hired Employee and qualified
dependents were covered by  Sellers\' employee benefit plan as of the Closing
and the Hired Employee  immediately elects coverage, including coverage for
qualified dependents,  under a similar employee benefit plan of Buyer or
Smithfield.   (i) With respect to the Hired Employees, prior employment
with  Sellers shall be recognized by Buyer or Smithfield for the purpose of 
determining vacation eligibility. All Hired Employees shall be subject to 
Buyer\'s and Smithfield\'s vacation policies, provided all such Hired 
Employees shall be given full credit for pre-Closing years of service 
recognized by Sellers for vacation purposes under Buyer\'s and   35    
Smithfield\'s policies, and all Hired Employees shall retain and be accorded 
by Buyer any vacation time which may have accrued on or prior to the  Closing
Date (to the extent accrued on the Final Net Working Capital 
Calculation).   (j) Upon the request of Buyer, Sellers will provide such 
payroll and other information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to 
minimize employment Taxes payable by Buyer with respect to any Hired 
Employees.   (k) The parties expressly acknowledge that this Agreement is 
not intended to create a contract between Buyer or Sellers and any Hired 
Employee, and no Foods Employee or Hired Employee may rely on this  Agreement
as the basis for any breach of contract claim against Buyer or  Sellers.
Sellers shall not, in any manner, be responsible or liable for 
administration or the payment of any benefit due under any plans maintained 
by Buyer and Buyer shall not, in any manner, be responsible or liable for 
administration or the payment of any benefit due under the Plans or any 
other employment benefit plans maintained by Sellers.   (l) Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed or construed to  require Buyer to continue to
employ any Hired Employees for any period  after Closing.   (m) Without
limiting the generality of Sellers\' rights to  continue to operate
consistent with the Ordinary Course of Business, the  parties expressly
acknowledge that after the date of this Agreement Sellers  may, in the
Ordinary Course of Business (on terms and conditions equivalent  in all
material respects to the current terms and conditions, or otherwise  on terms
and conditions reasonably acceptable to Buyer), extend any labor  contracts
which might have lapsed or which would otherwise lapse or  terminate prior to
the Outside Date.   7.3 Access. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Closing Date, Sellers shall, upon reasonable advance notice, afford
to Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, independent public
accountants, counsel, investment bankers, lenders, consultants and other
agents and representatives (collectively, "Representatives"), reasonable
access during normal business hours to Sellers\' employees, the Transferred
Assets and all records pertaining to the Business, as are necessary to allow
Buyer and its Representatives to make such inspections and to interview or
confer with officers, employees, agents and representatives of Sellers, as
Buyer believes are necessary and appropriate with respect to the Transferred
Assets or the Business. This access shall be subject to any existing
confidentiality agreements and to the execution of additional confidentiality
agreements reasonably required by Sellers, as well as subject to restrictions
imposed upon advice of counsel respecting the provision of competitively
sensitive information. Buyer shall not be entitled to (a) access to any
materials containing privileged communications, (b) information
about employees, disclosure of which might violate an employee\'s
reasonable expectation of privacy, (c) bids, letters of intent, expressions
of interest or other proposals received from others in connection with the
Business or the Transferred Assets, or (d) information in violation of
Applicable Law or that would cause a breach of any obligation by which it is
bound. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and
against any and all losses, costs or other damages caused by the willful
misconduct or negligent acts of Buyer or its Representatives in the course of
such examinations   36    and inspections (it being understood that the
discovery by Buyer or its Representatives of any existing Liability shall not
be covered by this indemnity).   7.4 HSR Act.   (a) Buyer and Sellers
each acknowledge that the applicable  waiting periods under the HSR Act have
expired. The parties, through their  counsel, shall reasonably cooperate with
each other throughout any other  antitrust investigation and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to  facilitate the lifting or termination of
any restraining orders,  injunctions or other similar actions under any Non-
Competition Law. During  any litigation regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  under Non-Competition Law, the parties, in
consultation with each other,  shall determine as promptly as practicable,
the appropriate nature and  scope of the parties\' response to any inquiries
or requests for information  and documentary materials that may be made by
the Federal Trade Commission  and the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust
Division (collectively the  "Agencies," and individually the "Agency") or
other Governmental Authority  pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Non-
Competition Law and, if  applicable, the parties shall submit their response
in a reasonably timely  manner.   The parties acknowledge that for purposes
of this Section 7.4,  "reasonably cooperate" shall mean (i) as promptly as
practicable, informing  the other party of all written communications
received from or submitted to  any Agency or other Governmental Authority of
which such party has  Knowledge, (ii) consulting with the other party
regarding and providing for  the other party\'s review all written
communications to any Agency or other  Governmental Authority, (iii)
notifying the other party of any scheduled  meeting or conference with any
Agency or other Governmental Authority of  which such party has sufficient
advance notice and consulting with the  other party prior to such scheduled
meeting or conference and (iv)  informing the other party of all unscheduled
meetings or conferences with  any Agency or other Governmental Authority as
promptly as practicable  following such meeting or conference. The parties
acknowledge and agree  that for the purposes of this Section 7.4, the term
"Knowledge" as it  applies to Sellers, shall not include the knowledge of
Sellers\' plant  managers, but only the Knowledge of the individuals
expressly named in the  definition of "Knowledge" in this Agreement.   The
parties further acknowledge that the parties\' covenant to  reasonably
cooperate with each other shall not require Sellers to take any  action which
would have the effect of impeding in any manner the actions of  other Persons
submitting or contemplating the submittal of a competing bid  for all or any
part of the Transferred Assets or the formulation or  consummation of a
possible Alternative Transaction. Accordingly, neither  Buyer nor its counsel
shall have the right to receive notice with respect  to or participate in any
meetings with any Agency or other Governmental  Authority which pertains to
such competing bids or Alternative  Transactions, or to review any
communications received from or to be  submitted to any Agency or other
Governmental Authority regarding such bids  or transactions. Similarly,
Sellers shall not be obligated to inform Buyer  of communications from any
Agency or other Governmental Authority regarding  competing bids or
Alternative Transactions or notify   37     Buyer of any scheduled or
unscheduled meetings or conferences with any  Agency or other Governmental
Authority pertaining to same.   (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, if  any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any  proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be  instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as  violative of any Non-Competition Law, Buyer and Sellers shall
reasonably  cooperate with each other to contest and resist any such action
or  proceeding and to seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any  decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary  or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Nothing in  this Section 7.4, however, shall limit a party\'s rights to
terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Sections 13.1(g) or 13.1(h) of this
Agreement.   (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby under any Non-Competition Law or if any 
suit is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any private party 
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any 
Non-Competition Law, Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate in 
responding to such objections or challenges so as to permit consummation of 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Nothing in this
Section 7.4 shall require any of Buyer,  Sellers or their respective
Affiliates to sell, hold separate or otherwise  dispose of or conduct their
business in a specified manner, or agree to  sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their business in a  specified manner, or permit the
sale, holding separate or other disposition  of, any assets of Buyer, Sellers
and their respective Affiliates or conduct  of their business in a specified
manner, as a condition to obtaining any  approval from a Governmental
Authority under any Non-Competition Law or any  other Person or for any other
reason.   7.5 Permits and Consents. Sellers shall use reasonable efforts
to obtain all consents, if any, of any person not a party to this Agreement
which are required to transfer any of the Transferred Assets to Buyer
(collectively, the "Required Consents") and cooperate with Buyer to obtain
all permits, if any, necessary to transfer the Transferred Assets to Buyer
(collectively, the "Permits"); provided, however, that Sellers shall not be
required to expend any funds in connection with the foregoing. Buyer shall
diligently seek and obtain all Permits, if any, and shall cooperate with
Sellers to obtain all Required Consents necessary to transfer the Transferred
Assets to Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision hereof to the
contrary, nothing herein shall be construed to require the consent of any
party to a Contract or Lease to its assignment to Buyer if assignment without
such consent is permissible under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.   7.6
Title Commitments and Buyer\'s Surveys. Buyer acknowledges access to the
Title Information, the Surveys, and the Leases. Buyer may, at Buyer\'s option
and expense, obtain from a title company or companies acceptable to Buyer
(collectively, the "Title Company"), commitments for title insurance covering
the Real Estate included as part of the   38    Transferred Assets in
form and substance satisfactory to Buyer (collectively the "Title
Commitments"). Buyer may also, at Buyer\'s option and expense, cause to
be prepared current boundary surveys (collectively, the "Buyer\'s Surveys")
of such Real Estate prepared by a registered public surveyor. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, obtaining the Title Commitments and the Buyer\'s Surveys shall
not delay the Closing and Sellers shall have no obligation to cure defects in
title or other matters disclosed by the Title Commitments or the Buyer\'s
Surveys, it being understood that any such defect or other matter shall be
evaluated in the context of Sections 9.1 and 9.7 of this Agreement.   7.7
Sales and Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall be responsible for and agree to pay
when due all sales, use, recording and transfer Taxes arising out of the
transfer of the Transferred Assets by Sellers and the other
transactions contemplated herein, specifically including, without limitation,
all sales and transfer Taxes with respect to any real or personal property
(including vehicles) to be transferred to Buyer hereunder.   7.8 Affiliate
Rights. Buyer may not through any Affiliate take any action or exercise any
rights in connection with the purchase of the Transferred Assets which Buyer
would otherwise be prohibited from taking or exercising directly.   7.9
Conduct of the Business Pending the Closing. Except as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement (including the information on the exhibits and schedules
attached hereto), except with the prior written consent of Buyer, and except
for any actions or omissions that would not be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, during the period from the date hereof to and through the
Closing Date, Sellers shall, subject to the limitations imposed on Sellers as
a result of having filed the Bankruptcy Cases, conduct the Business in all
material respects in the Ordinary Course of Business and in compliance with
Applicable Law, and preserve in all material respects the present
business operations, organization and goodwill of the Business; and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof until the
Closing Date, subject to the foregoing exceptions, Sellers shall not (a)
change any method of accounting or accounting practice used by them, except
for any change required by generally accepted accounting principles, (b)
establish or increase the benefits under, or promise to establish, modify or
increase the benefits under, any employee benefit plan or otherwise increase
the compensation payable to any Foods Employee, except in the Ordinary Course
of Business or otherwise in accordance with existing plans and agreements
consistent with past practice, or establish, adopt or enter into any
collective bargaining agreement, (c) obtain any rulings or make any elections
with respect to Taxes, or enter into any agreements with any taxing authority
in the event the same could materially and adversely impact the Business, (d)
merge or consolidate with any other Person or acquire a material amount of
assets of any other Person, (e) except in the Ordinary Course of Business,
lease, license or otherwise surrender, relinquish, encumber, or dispose of
any Transferred Assets other than the disposition of obsolete or damaged
immaterial Transferred Assets, (f) fail to maintain Inventory to and
including the Closing Date of a quality usable and salable in the Ordinary
Course of Business (which takes into account normal levels of damaged, short
dated, obsolete or outdated goods or supplies), and in quantities in
accordance with the Ordinary Course of Business and adjusted for
seasonality, (g) create accounts receivable to be included among the
Transferred Assets other than those arising from bona fide transactions in
the Ordinary Course of Business, or (h) establish accounts payable to be
included among the Assumed Liabilities other than those arising from bona
fide transactions in the Ordinary Course   39    of Business. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require Sellers to make any
payments, incur any costs, or enter into or amend any contractual
arrangements, agreements or understandings, unless such payment, incurrence
or other action is required by Applicable Law, by contractual obligation with
such third parties or to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business.   7.10
Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing Date, none of Sellers, Buyer, or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, shall issue any press
release or public statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
parties hereto, unless such disclosure is required by Applicable Law, an
Order of the Bankruptcy Court or by obligations pursuant to any
agreement with any national securities exchange; provided, that the party
intending to make such release shall give the other parties prior notice and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such Applicable
Law, Order or obligation to consult with the other parties with respect to
the text thereof.   7.11 Releases of Guarantees. Industries and certain of
its Affiliates are guarantors with respect to certain obligations of Foods,
as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule, Section 7.11 (the "Guaranteed
Indebtedness"). Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts including, without limitation, Buyer and Smithfield offering to
substitute Smithfield guarantees, to cause Industries or its Affiliates, as
applicable, to be replaced by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, as guarantor
or other applicable status with respect to all of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness.   7.12 Audited Financial Statements. At Buyer\'s request and
at Buyer\'s expense, Sellers shall authorize KPMG LLP to prepare and deliver
to Buyer promptly following the Closing Date, audited financial statements of
the Business as of and for the periods required by Regulation S-X promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Sellers shall cooperate in a
manner consistent with their past practice in the preparation of such
financial statements.   7.13 Books and Records; Personnel. Except in the
ordinary course of business of such party regarding its own general records
or in compliance with such party\'s record retention policies, until the
sooner to occur of (a) five (5) years after the Closing Date or (b) the
expiration or termination of the Capital Improvements Agreement, Buyer and
Sellers will maintain all books and records, including electronic and
computerized records that relate to the pre-Closing business, operations,
assets and properties related to the Business, and shall give each other
party full and complete access during regular business hours to all such
books, records, and personnel to the extent reasonably required to enable
such other party to satisfy its respective obligations hereunder or under
Applicable Law. In addition to the foregoing, neither Sellers nor Buyer
shall, without ninety (90) days prior written notification (a "Destruction
Notice") to the other, destroy any pre-Closing books and records, including
electronic and computerized records, related to the Business, unless such
destruction is to occur in the ordinary course of business of the
party destroying such books and records, or in compliance with such party\'s
general record retention policies. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.13, neither party shall destroy any documents
that remain relevant to taxes or Tax Returns that are the responsibility of
the other party for which the statute of limitations has not  
40    expired without prior giving of a Destruction Notice to the other
party. Following receipt of a Destruction Notice, if Sellers or Buyer, as
applicable, advises the other party in writing within such ninety (90) day
period, the applicable party will promptly deliver the applicable books and
records to the other.  SECTION 8. TAX MATTERS.  ------------   8.1 Sales
and Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall be responsible for and agree to pay when
due all sales, use, value added, documentary, stamp, gross receipts,
transfer, conveyance, excise, real estate recording and other similar Taxes

Transferred Assets by Sellers and the other transactions contemplated herein,
specifically including, without limitation, all sales, recording and transfer
Taxes with respect to any real property or vehicles to be transferred to
Buyer hereunder. Sellers shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes, if any, provided
that Buyer shall be permitted to prepare any such Tax Returns that are the
primary responsibility of Buyer under Applicable Law. Buyer\'s or Sellers\'
preparation of any such Tax Returns shall be subject to Sellers\' approval or
Buyer\'s approval, respectively, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
Sellers in procuring any available exemptions from any Transfer Taxes and
shall reasonably cooperate in procuring any documentation that may be
necessary to establish any such exemption.   8.2 Cooperation on Tax
Matters. After the Closing, Sellers will cooperate with Buyer, and Buyer will
cooperate with Sellers, to the extent necessary in the preparation of all Tax

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that has not
been withdrawn or terminated.   9.7 No Material Adverse Effect. Since the
date of the Original Agreement, no Material Adverse Effect (including, but
not limited to, a Material Adverse Effect occurring as a consequence of the

the conditions set forth below, although notwithstanding the failure of any
one or more of such conditions, Sellers may nevertheless proceed with Closing

TERMINATION, BREAK-UP FEE AND REMEDIES. 
---------------------------------------   13.1 Termination and Abandonment.
This Agreement may be terminated and abandoned on or prior to the Closing
Date as follows: (a) by Buyer if a material breach of any provision of this
Agreement has been committed by Sellers and such breach has not been waived
by Buyer or cured by Sellers (Buyer agreeing to first notify Sellers in
writing of such breach and to afford Sellers the opportunity to cure such
breach for a period designated by Sellers by notice to Buyer upon receipt of
Buyer\'s notice, in which event Buyer may not terminate this Agreement by
reason of such breach unless Sellers shall have failed to cure the same by
the end of such period so designated by Sellers; provided, however, that in
no event shall the cure period so designated by Sellers extend beyond the
Outside Date); (b) by Sellers if a material breach of any provision of
this Agreement has been committed by Buyer or Smithfield and such breach has
not been waived by Sellers or cured by Buyer or Smithfield (Sellers agreeing
to first notify Buyer in writing of such breach and to afford Buyer or
Smithfield the opportunity to cure such breach for a period designated by
Buyer by notice to Sellers upon receipt of Sellers\' notice, in which event
Sellers may not terminate this Agreement by reason of such breach unless
Buyer or Smithfield shall have failed to cure the same by the end of such
period so designated by Buyer; provided, however, that in no event shall the
cure period so designated by Buyer extend beyond the Outside Date); (c) by
Buyer if any condition in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.6 or 9.7 has not
been satisfied as of the Closing Date (subject, however, to Sellers\' option
to extend set forth in Section 9 with respect to Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.4, 9.6
or 9.7) or if the satisfaction of such a condition by the Closing is or
becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer or Smithfield to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement), and Buyer has not waived
such condition on or before such date; (d) by Sellers if any condition in
Sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.4, or 10.5 has not been satisfied as of the Closing
Date (subject, however, to Buyer\'s option to extend set forth in Section 10
with respect to Sections 10.1, 10.2 or 10.5) or if the satisfaction of such a
condition by the Closing Date is or becomes impossible (other than through
the failure of Sellers to comply with their obligations under this
Agreement), and Sellers have not waived such condition on or before such
date; (e) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto; (f) by
either Buyer or Sellers, upon the consummation of an Alternative Transaction;
(g) by Sellers if the condition in Section 10.3 has not been satisfied by the
Outside Date; (h) by Buyer if the condition in Section 9.5 has not been
satisfied by the Outside Date; or (i) by Sellers or Buyer if the Approval
Order shall not have been entered by the   45    Bankruptcy Court by
the third (3/rd/) Business Day prior to the Outside Date. In the event of
termination by any party as provided above, written notice shall promptly be
given to the other party and each party shall pay its own expenses incident
to the preparation for the consummation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. If validly terminated pursuant to this
Section 13.1, this Agreement shall become wholly void and of no further force
and effect without liability to Buyer, Smithfield, Foods, Industries or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, except that the
obligations of Buyer under the confidentiality agreement delivered by Buyer
and the obligations of the parties under the Deposit Escrow Agreement, this
Section 13.1 and Sections 3.1, 7.10, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5 and 14 of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Within ten (10) days of the
effectiveness of any such termination and, if applicable, the payment of the
Break-up Fee or the applicable portion thereof, Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers copies of each of the Title Commitments and Buyer\'s Surveys. Subject
to the provisions of Section 13.4 and 13.5, Sellers shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to release the Deposit to the Buyer upon the termination of this
Agreement.   13.2 Break-up Fee. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or Section 13.1(f), Sellers agree to
pay to Buyer the Break-up Fee on the date of consummation of such Alternative
Transaction or on the date of termination of this Agreement solely by reason
of a material breach of this Agreement by Sellers, as the case may be;
provided, however, the Break-up Fee shall not be due and payable if there
shall have occurred and shall then be continuing a material breach by Buyer
or Smithfield of any of their covenants, agreements, representations,
warranties or other obligations contained in this Agreement, and provided
further, however, that only the amount of $3,000,000 of the Break-up Fee
shall be due and payable to Buyer upon termination pursuant to Section
13.1(a) of this Agreement in the event of the material breach of the
representations and warranties of Sellers under this Agreement (as contrasted
with other material breaches). If this Agreement is terminated under Section
13.1(f), and the Alternative Transaction that caused the termination is a
transaction in which Smithfield or an Affiliate thereof obtains an interest
in the Transferred Assets, only a portion of the Break-up Fee shall be
payable hereunder, which portion shall equal the product of the Break-up Fee
times a fraction (a) the numerator of which is the value of the Transferred
Assets in which Smithfield or an Affiliate thereof does not obtain an
interest, and (b) the denominator of which is the total value of
the Transferred Assets as determined pursuant to the order entered by the
Bankruptcy Court in connection with the "Auction" (as such term is defined in
the Bid Procedures Attachment) and the order(s) entered by the Bankruptcy
Court approving such Alternative Transaction.   13.3 BUYER\'S REMEDIES.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.2 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN
CONNECTION WITH A TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT BUYER MAY BE ENTITLED TO THE
BREAK-UP FEE OR A PORTION OF THE BREAK-UP FEE AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE
PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ACTUAL DAMAGES WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN. IF
THE BUYER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIPT OF THE BREAK-UP FEE OR A PORTION OF
THE BREAK-UP FEE UNDER THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER AND SELLERS
AGREE THAT NEITHER BUYER NOR SMITHFIELD MAY SEEK ANY REMEDIES OTHER THAN
COLLECTION OF THE BREAK-UP FEE OR SUCH PORTION OF THE BREAK-UP FEE, AND
NEITHER BUYER NOR SMITHFIELD MAY CLAIM ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES AS A RESULT
OF   46    SUCH TERMINATION, BUT OTHERWISE BUYER AND SMITHFIELD HEREBY
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO SEEK ANY OTHER REMEDY OR TO SEEK ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES,
INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BY REASON OF ANY DEFAULT BY SELLERS OR
TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THIS AGREEMENT
IS TERMINATED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13.1(a) OR IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR
DUE TO ANY FAILURE OF SELLERS TO CLOSE OR ANY MATERIAL BREACH BY SELLERS OF
THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER AND SMITHFIELD MAY PURSUE THE
REMEDY OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO SALE OF THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS
AND OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN.   13.4 SELLERS\' REMEDIES. IN THE EVENT THIS AGREEMENT IS
TERMINATED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13.1(b) OR IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR DUE
TO ANY FAILURE OF BUYER TO CLOSE IN MATERIAL BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, THEN BUYER AND SELLERS AGREE THAT THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE
FORFEITED TO SELLERS AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
ACTUAL DAMAGES WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE DEPOSIT
SHALL NOT BE FORFEITED IF THERE SHALL HAVE OCCURRED AND SHALL THEN BE
CONTINUING A MATERIAL BREACH BY SELLERS OF ANY OF THEIR COVENANTS,
AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN
THIS AGREEMENT). IF THE SELLERS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIPT OF THE DEPOSIT
UNDER THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, BUYER AND SELLERS AGREE THAT
SELLERS MAY NOT SEEK ANY REMEDIES OTHER THAN COLLECTION OF THE DEPOSIT AND
SELLERS MAY NOT CLAIM ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF SUCH TERMINATION,
BUT OTHERWISE SELLERS HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO SEEK ANY OTHER REMEDY OR TO
SEEK ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES BY REASON OF ANY
DEFAULT BY BUYER OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.   13.5 Release of HSR
Deposit. Buyer assumes the risk of and responsibility for compliance of the
transactions under this Agreement with the HSR Act and applicable Non-
Competition Law. If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
13.1(h) or if Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(g),
then notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall forfeit the HSR Deposit to Sellers and the HSR Deposit shall be
released and paid over to Sellers. Upon any such termination, if Buyer is, as
of the date of termination, otherwise in compliance with its
obligations, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties under this
Agreement, then Buyer shall be entitled to receive a refund of the balance of
the Deposit, less the HSR Deposit, in accordance with the Deposit Escrow
Agreement. Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree, in any event, that no
failure by Sellers to "reasonably cooperate" with Buyer in accordance with
the provisions of Section 7.4 shall be the basis for termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(a) of this Agreement unless Buyer shall,
with reasonable promptness upon obtaining knowledge thereof, have first
provided written notice to Sellers specifying the action or failure to act of
Sellers which is the basis for Buyer\'s claim of material breach by Sellers
and Buyer shall have afforded to Sellers reasonable opportunity to cure such
claim of material breach; in addition, any such   47    material breach
or claim of material breach by Sellers as to which Buyer shall have afforded
Sellers notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure as described above shall
not be the basis for any relief of Buyer from its obligations under this
Section 13.5 of this Agreement unless such material breach or claim
of material breach directly and proximately caused the failure or
nonsatisfaction of the condition in Section 9.5 of this Agreement.  SECTION
14. MISCELLANEOUS.  --------------   14.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees to be responsible for its own costs, without right of

of the parties, including those required to sell, transfer, convey and assign
to, and vest in Buyer, and to place Buyer in possession of the Transferred
Assets, to reserve the Excluded Assets in favor of Sellers, and otherwise to
consummate the transactions hereunder.   14.3 Inform of Litigation. During
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, each party
will promptly inform the other party in writing of any litigation commenced
against such party in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   14.4 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
either party without the prior written consent of the other party and any
attempted assignment without such written consent shall be null and void and
without legal effect; provided, however, that Sellers shall not withhold
their consent to an assignment by Buyer of its rights under this Agreement to
an Affiliate of Buyer, provided that (a) the assignee shall assume in writing
(in form reasonably satisfactory to Sellers), jointly and severally with
Buyer, all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, (b) the assignment
shall not require any third party approvals or filing of notices and shall
not otherwise delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein,
