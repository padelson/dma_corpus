Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if neither the rights or obligations of any party hereto under, nor the economic or legal substance in the
aggregate of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement will be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a)&nbsp;such provision will be fully severable, (b)&nbsp;this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c)&nbsp;the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance
herefrom and (d)&nbsp;in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable

the parties. </FONT></P>
