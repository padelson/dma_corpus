("Parent"), FELIX 2011 ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Florida corporation and a

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has
agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company Common Stock
contemplated thereby, the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $9.75 (such amount or any different amount per share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"),
net to the seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company with the Company surviving that merger (the
"Merger") in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA"), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, other than (except as otherwise provided in Article III) (a) shares of
Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, (b) the Dissenting Shares (if any) and (c) any shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (if any) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (a)
determined that the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other
transactions contemplated herein are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, (b) adopted and approved this Agreement in
accordance with the FBCA and declared advisable this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other transactions contemplated herein, and
(c) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, if required, approval
of this Agreement (including the plan of merger) and the Merger by its
shareholders;

 



1 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, including
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated herein and also to prescribe certain procedures and
conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.01 The Offer. 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII hereof, as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, not
later than the 20th calendar day) after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall commence, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")),
the Offer.

(b) The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) there being validly tendered in
the Offer, and not validly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled Expiration
Time, that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, together with the
shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity for the benefit of customers or clients) (if any), represents
at least a majority of the Company Common Stock then outstanding determined on
a fully diluted basis (meaning, for this purpose, assuming the conversion,
exchange or exercise of all then-outstanding warrants, options, securities,
rights or other instruments convertible or exchangeable into, or exercisable
for, shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not then convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable, regardless of the conversion or exercise price,
the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof (other than any
Top-Up Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option)) (the "Minimum
Condition") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub (in
their sole discretion), of the other conditions and requirements set forth in
Exhibit A (together with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). The
Offer Price

 



2  payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the
seller in cash, without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth
in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (in their
sole discretion) to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition, to
increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that, unless otherwise provided
by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger
Sub shall not, subject to applicable Law, (i) reduce the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii)
change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set
forth in Exhibit A or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse
in any respect to the shareholders of the Company, (v) except as otherwise
provided in this Section 1.01, extend or otherwise change the expiration date
of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, or
(vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a
manner adverse in any material respect to the shareholders of the Company.

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City Time) on the date that
is twenty (20) Offer Business Days following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "Initial
Expiration Time") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to
which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this
Agreement, is referred to as the "Expiration Time").

(e) Without limiting ParentÂ’s or Merger SubÂ’s obligations under this Section
1.01 or otherwise, (i) Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent
of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions if on any then-
scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied
or, in the sole discretion of Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), waived,
until such time as such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii)
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by applicable Law,
any interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC"), the staff thereof or The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") applicable to
the Offer, (iii) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (other than
the Minimum Condition) shall have not been satisfied (or, in the sole
discretion of Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) waived) as of any then-
scheduled Expiration Time, then Merger Sub, at the request of the Company,
shall extend the Offer, with the length of such extension period to be
determined by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) in its sole discretion and
(iv) in the event that the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied as
of the then-scheduled Expiration Time and all of the other conditions to the
Offer set forth in Exhibit A have been satisfied as of such Expiration Time,
then, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for one
extension period of up to twenty (20) Offer Business Days, the length of such
period to be determined by

 



3  the Company in its sole discretion; _provided, however,_ that in no event
shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer (A) beyond December 19, 2011
(the "Outside Date") or (B) at any time that Parent or Merger Sub is
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII.

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall consummate, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to consummate, the Offer
and shall accept and pay for, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accept and
pay for (subject to any withholding of Taxes pursuant to Section 3.05), all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Time (as it may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01). Acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer
Conditions upon the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Closing," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date." Merger Sub expressly reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, to extend the
Offer for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof)
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. The Offer Documents (as
defined below) may, in Merger Sub\'s sole discretion, provide for such a
reservation of right. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to applicable
rules of the SEC and the terms and conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to delay payment for shares of Company Common
Stock in order to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any such
delay in payment shall be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act.

 

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article VIII, prior to the acceptance for payment of the Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all
tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall
include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the
Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to
cause as promptly as practicable the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to
the 

 



4  extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub further agree
to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if
applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company
with copies of all correspondence between them and their representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the
Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC
or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments.

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

Section 1.02 Company Actions.

(a) Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC on the date
the Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6.02,
contain the recommendation described in Section 4.17. The Company agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or
otherwise reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, agree to correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause as promptly as practicable the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if
applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall 

 



5  promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence
between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders
of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9
or response, and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such

names and addresses of the record holders and/or beneficial owners of the
shares of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such information and
reasonable assistance (including lists of record holders and/or beneficial
owners of the shares of Company Common Stock, updated from time to time upon
Parent\'s, Merger Sub\'s or either of their respective agent\'s request, and

reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
holders and beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 1.03 Directors.

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter until
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.03 hereof), unless otherwise
determined by Parent as provided in this Section 1.03, the Company Board
immediately prior to the Offer Closing shall be the Company Board upon and
after the Offer Closing. To the extent Parent determines to designate any
directors to the Company Board upon the Offer Closing and from time to time
thereafter until the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board
that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company
Board (giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective subsidiaries (including shares accepted for payment)
bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and
the Company shall cause ParentÂ’s designees to be elected or appointed to
the Company Board, including by increasing the number of directors that
constitute the Company Board and/or seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors. At such time, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (A) each committee of the Company Board and (B) as
requested by Parent, each board of directors of each subsidiary of the Company
(and each committee thereof), that represents the same percentage of such
committee or subsidiary board of directors (or committees thereof) as such
individuals represent on the Company Board.

 



6 (b) To the extent Parent determines to designate any directors to the Company
Board pursuant to Section 1.03(a), the CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint
Parent\'s designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions necessary to effect the appointment of ParentÂ’s
designees, including mailing to its shareholders information with respect to
the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03(b),
which shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9 (or thereafter, if
Parent determines to designate such directors at a time following distribution
of the Schedule 14D-9). Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required to be described or
disclosed by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and the Company\'s obligations
under Section 1.03(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such
information.

(c) To the extent Parent determines to designate any directors to the Company
Board pursuant to Section 1.03(a), following the election or appointment of
Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time,
the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who
were not designated by Parent (the "Continuing Directors") (or the approval of
the sole Continuing Director if there shall only be one Continuing Director
then in office) shall be required to authorize (i) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment or modification of this Agreement
requiring action by the Company Board or otherwise, (iii) any extension of
time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger
Sub and (iv) any waiver of full compliance or default with respect to any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions
contained herein for the benefit of the Company and/or the holders of Company
Common Stock, in each case if such action would adversely affect, or
reasonably would be expected to adversely affect, the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub). Prior to the Effective
Time, there shall be at least one Continuing Director on the Company Board,
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if no Continuing Directors are available to
serve, as a result of death, disability or resignation, then the other
directors then serving on the Company Board shall designate and appoint to the
Company Board one director who is not a current or former officer, director,
employee of independent contractor of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and such individual shall be deemed a Continuing Director for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) Prior to the date on which the Offer is commenced, except with respect to
two (2) current directors of the Company as agreed with Parent, the Company
will obtain and provide to Parent irrevocable resignations of each director on
the Company Board, which resignations will each be contingent solely upon the
occurrence of the Offer Closing and the CompanyÂ’s acceptance of such
resignation (which acceptance shall not occur without the prior written
consent of Parent). Upon the Offer Closing, if so directed by Parent, the
Company shall accept such number of resignations as will be necessary to
effectuate the exercise of ParentÂ’s rights under this Section 1.03.

 



7 Section 1.04 Top-Up Option.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 1.04, to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid
in the Offer, up to a number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Top-Up Shares") which is equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub and any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (other than treasury shares or shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for
the benefit of customers or clients) immediately prior to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than eighty percent (80%) of
the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance
of the Top-Up Shares on a fully diluted basis (meaning, for this purpose,
assuming the conversion, exchange or exercise of all then-outstanding
warrants, options, securities, rights or other instruments convertible or
exchangeable into, or exercisable for, shares of Company Common Stock, whether
or not then convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, regardless of
the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and
conditions thereof) but not less than one share more than eighty percent (80%)
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares); _provided, however_ , that (i)
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company
Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and
unissued or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option (giving effect to the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable pursuant to all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock,
performance shares and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if
such shares were outstanding) and (ii) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable if either the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance and
delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall be prohibited by any applicable law. The
Top-Up Option may be exercised in whole or in part, at any time following the
Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective Time and
(B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

(b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall give the Company prior written notice, specifying (i) the number of
shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its subsidiaries (other
than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit of customers or
clients) at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing) and
(ii) a reasonable place and a time within the continental United States for
the closing of such purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the
number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub. At 

 



8  the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the aggregate purchase price
owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the
Company at Parent\'s election, either (i) entirely in cash, by wire transfer
of same-day funds, or (ii) by (A) paying in cash by wire transfer of same-day
funds an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option
less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the
"Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall bear simple interest at the
then prime rate, as from time to time charged by JPMorgan Chase Bank N. A. or
any successor bank thereto, (ii) shall mature and principal and all accrued
interest shall be payable in full on or prior to one (1) year from the date
of execution of the Promissory Note, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent
and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other material terms. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Merger Sub shall pay any Florida
documentary stamps and/or any other Tax payable with respect to the issuance
and/or delivery of the Promissory Note. The Company shall cause to be issued
to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if the Company
does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry
Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends
that are required by federal or state securities Laws. The parties agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the notice regarding the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is deemed received by the Company and, in any event, as
promptly thereafter as possible.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Securities Act") and that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

 

(d) The parties agree and acknowledge that, in any appraisal proceeding with
respect to the Dissenting Shares, and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Entity shall not assert that the Top-Up Option,
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the payment by Merger Sub to the Company
of any consideration for the Top-Up Shares should be considered by the Court
in connection with its determination in accordance with the FBCA of the fair
value of the Dissenting Shares as contemplated by Section 3.03.

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 3.01 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

 

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise, other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the
like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit of
customers or clients, or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously
contracted) or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) shares to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 3.01(a),
(ii) Dissenting Shares and (iii) any shares that are owned by a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity for the benefit of customers or clients, or shares held in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) will be converted into the
right to receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to the Offer
Price (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all shares of Company
Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and,
subject to Section 3.03, each holder of a certificate formerly representing
any such shares (each, a "Certificate") will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.02 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for
the benefit of customers or clients, or shares held in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted) shall survive the Merger as common stock of the
Surviving Entity.

 



11 (c) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Entity. 

Section 3.02 Surrender and Payment.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration: (i) the
Certificates or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Book-
Entry Shares"). On and after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Entity to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, sufficient
funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of
all of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and
the Book-Entry Shares (the "Payment Fund") in amounts and at the times
necessary for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment
Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be
entitled under Section 3.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to
enable or cause the Surviving Entity promptly to deposit in trust additional
cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments required under
Section 3.01(b), and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall in any event be
liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but, in any event, within five (5) Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions in customary form
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms
set forth in Section 3.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only

 



12  the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, each Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or will
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment will pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
for payment of the Merger Consideration (without interest) upon due surrender
of such holderÂ’s Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with this
Article III.

 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash or
distributions from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



13 Section 3.03 Dissenting Shares. In the event that the Merger is
effected pursuant to Section 607.1104 of the FBCA, then in addition to any
dissentersÂ’ rights that may be applicable to the Merger irrespective of
Section 607.1104 of the FBCA, holders of shares of Company Common Stock who,
except for the applicability of Section 607.1104 of the FBCA, would be
entitled to vote upon the Merger and who dissent from the Merger pursuant to
Section 607.1321 of the FBCA, may be entitled, if they comply with the
provisions of the FBCA regarding dissentersÂ’ rights, to be paid the fair
value of their shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair
value of such shares in accordance with Section 607.1302 of the FBCA (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by the FBCA. If any such shareholder of the Company
shall fail to perfect or effectively shall withdraw or lose such shareholderÂ’s
right to be paid fair value under Sections 607.1321 and 607.1323 of the FBCA,
such holderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company or the
Surviving Entity shall immediately give Parent (i) notice of any
notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other
notices served pursuant to Section 607.1321 of the FBCA and received by the
Company (or the Surviving Entity) and (ii) the opportunity to direct and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of such
dissentersÂ’ rights under Section 607.1302 of the FBCA. The Company (or the
Surviving Entity) shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to
any such exercise of dissentersÂ’ rights or offer to settle, or settle, any
such rights.

 

Section 3.04 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of
additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this
Agreement), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock,
the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change.

Section 3.05 Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be, such amounts
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable Treasury
Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

 



14  To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange
Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 

Section 3.06 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article
III.

Section 3.07 Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-based Compensation.

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time: 

(i) each Company Stock Option granted under any of the Company Incentive
Equity Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is "out-of-the-money" ( _i.e._ , the Merger Consideration is equal to or
less than the exercise price of such Company Stock Option) at the Effective
Time will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and
no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor, and

(ii) each vested (including automatic accelerated vesting pursuant to the
terms of such Company Stock Option as a result of the transactions
contemplated herein) or unvested Company Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is "in-the-money" ( _i.e._ ,
the Merger Consideration is higher than the exercise price of such Company
Stock Option) at the Effective Time will be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of that Company Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted into
the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Entity, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y)
the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
under such Company Stock Option, less any Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with Section 3.05. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, by adopting
this Agreement, all members of the Company Board have confirmed their
agreement that any Company Stock Options that they hold immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be treated in the same manner as described above, as
applicable.

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time:

(i) each Restricted Stock Award and each Company Performance Share Award that
is vested at the Effective Time (including automatic accelerated vesting
pursuant to the terms of such Restricted Stock Award or Company Performance
Share Award as a result of

 



15  the transactions contemplated herein) will be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of that Restricted Stock Award or Company Performance Share Award or any
other Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent
and the Surviving Entity, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such
Restricted Stock Award (all Restricted Stock Awards automatically vest 100% in
accordance with the change in control contemplated by this Agreement,
except for the Un-accelerated Restricted Stock Awards) or Company Performance
Share Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.05, and

 

(ii) each Company Performance Share Award and Un-accelerated Restricted Stock
Award that is unvested at the Effective Time will be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of that Company Performance Share Award or Un-accelerated Restricted
Stock Award (as applicable) or any other Person, cancelled and converted into
the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Entity, on its applicable
vesting date (and subject to so vesting, including vesting that is accelerated
pursuant to the terms of such Company Performance Share Award or Un-
accelerated Restricted Stock Award) after the Effective Time, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such Company Performance Share
Award or Un-accelerated Restricted Stock Award (as applicable) multiplied by
(y) the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes required to be withheld in
accordance with Section 3.05.

 

(c) At or prior to the Offer Closing, the Company, the Company Board and/or

16 ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the CompanyÂ’s disclosure schedule, dated the date of
this Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.01 Organization; Qualification.

(a) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
license, use, lease and operate its assets, rights and properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, the failure of which would
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below in subsection (b)) on the
Company. The Company has provided or made accessible to Parent complete and
correct copies of its articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
of each of its subsidiaries.

 

(b) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the assets,
rights or property owned, licensed, used, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to any Person, an event, circumstance, change or
effect (i) that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse
effect on the business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results
of operations of such Person and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other
than the effects of changes after the date of this Agreement (1) in the world
economy, or the economy of the United States, or the economy of any other
country or region, of general scope, including, interest and/or exchange rates
and other market conditions generally, (2) affecting generally such PersonÂ’s
industry segment, (3) in Laws of general applicability or generally applicable
to a PersonÂ’s industry, (4) in United States generally accepted accounting
principles of general applicability or generally applicable to such PersonÂ’s
industry segment (or to the extent applicable to the UK Subsidiary, UK GAAP),
or (5) directly resulting from such PersonÂ’s compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or actions taken or not taken by such Person
upon the written request of the other party to this Agreement, or (ii) which
would prevent such Person from consummating the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Outside Date. In
determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect, any event,
circumstance, change or effect shall be considered both individually and
together with all other events, circumstances, changes or effects and any
event, circumstance, change or effect that reasonably is likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on such Person (individually or together with one or
more other events, circumstances, changes or effects) shall be considered a
Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any
movement in the price of any partyÂ’s stock on the open market or change in
price or value in any partyÂ’s industry segment, or the markets or major
indexes generally, constitute, in itself, such an event, circumstance, change
or effect (except that the underlying causes of such movement or change, if
not disqualified from consideration under clause (i)(1-4) above, can be
considered for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred).

 



17 Section 4.02 Capitalization.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on
April 19, 2011 (the "Capitalization Date"), (i) 40,138,397 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding, and (iii) under the Company Incentive
Equity Plans, 2,938,495 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable upon the
exercise of Company Stock Options, 330,536 shares of Company Common Stock
were issuable upon the vesting of Company Performance Share Awards, and
975,333 shares of Company Common Stock have been issued as, and are still
subject to, Restricted Stock Awards. All Restricted Stock Awards
automatically vest 100% in connection with a change in control of the Company,
except for Restricted Stock Awards granted to three individuals in connection
with two technology acquisitions completed by the Company (or one of its
subsidiaries) in 2010, for 77,400, 58,824 and 41,959 shares of Company Common
Stock, respectively, which do not provide for accelerated vesting upon a
change of control but do provide for accelerated vesting in other
circumstances, such as death, disability or, if applicable, termination of
employment without cause (such three Restricted Stock Awards are herein
referred to as the "Un-accelerated Restricted Stock Awards"). All outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly
issued and, subject only to the vesting and forfeiture terms and conditions of
the Restricted Stock Awards, are fully paid and nonassessable, and have not
been issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights. There are no
shares of Company Common Stock owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which shareholders of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries may vote. Except as set forth above in this Section 4.02(a), and
for changes since the Capitalization Date resulting from the exercise of
Company Stock Options outstanding on the Capitalization Date in accordance
with their terms, there are no outstanding (x) shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company, (y) securities of the Company
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other
securities of the Company or (z) subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, phantom stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based
performance units, agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments or
rights of any type granted or entered into by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries relating to the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of
any securities of the Company or that give any Person the right to receive
any economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits
and rights of securities of the Company. There are no outstanding obligations
of the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any securities of the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s
subsidiaries or to vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital stock of
the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries.

 



18 (b) _Section 4.02(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists each
outstanding Company Stock Option, Company Performance Share Award, and
Restricted Stock Award, the holder thereof, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable or issued thereunder and, if applicable, the exercise
price thereof. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary has any obligation to
register any securities under the Securities Act or under any state securities
Law or has any obligation to register securities for any individual or entity;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the shares of Company Common Stock underlying
issuances and potential issuances under the Company Incentive Equity Plans
have been registered with the SEC on Forms S-8.

 

(c) _Section 4.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists each
subsidiary of the Company and the capitalization of each such subsidiary. All
the outstanding shares of capital stock (or other securities) of each such
subsidiary are owned by the Company, free and clear of all Liens (as defined
below), charges, security interests, mortgages, pledges, options, preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal or first offer, proxies, levies, voting trusts
or agreements, or other adverse claims or restrictions on title or transfer of
any nature, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. There are no (i) securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock or other securities of any subsidiary of the
Company, or (ii) subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, phantom
stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units,
agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type
granted or entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to
the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of any securities of any
subsidiary of the Company or that give any Person the right to receive any
economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and
rights of securities of any subsidiary of the Company. Except for the capital
stock of its subsidiaries, and ownership of less than 1% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of CBOE Holding, Inc. (CBOE), which a Company
subsidiary (TradeStation Securities, Inc.) received in exchange for its
membership in CBOEÂ’s exchange subsidiary in connection with CBOE becoming a
publicly-traded entity, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock or other ownership interest in any entity. Except with respect
to certain of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiariesÂ’ guaranties and obligations to their
clearing organizations and exchanges under their standard membership or
participation agreements, the Company is not subject to any obligation or
requirement to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any entity or any other Person. As
used herein, "Lien" shall mean any mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest,
conditional or installment sale agreement, encumbrance, charge or other
claims of third parties of any kind, (including, with respect to capital
stock, any option or other right to purchase or any restriction on voting or
other rights other than awards and grants pursuant to the Company Incentive
Equity Plans).

Section 4.04 Company Reports; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Compliance.

 

(a) The Company has timely filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
registrations, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed by it since December
31, 2007 (such documents, together with any documents filed during such period
by the Company to the SEC on a voluntary basis on its Current Reports on Form
8-K, collectively, the "Company SEC Documents") and has paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith. The Company SEC Documents
(i) do not contain, as of the respective filing dates thereof (and without
giving effect to any amendments or modifications filed after the date of this
Agreement), any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Company
has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all material
written correspondence between the SEC and the Company and any of its
subsidiaries occurring since December 31, 2007 and prior to the date of this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding SEC
comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC relating to any
of the Company SEC Documents.

 



21 (b) The financial statements of the Company included in the Company
SEC Documents, including any related notes and schedules thereto, comply in
all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect at
the time of preparation and filing of such Company SEC Documents, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be set forth in the notes
thereto and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring audit adjustments not material in amount) and fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations, changes in shareholdersÂ’ equity (in the audited financial
statements of the Company) and cash flows for the periods indicated. The books
and records of the Company and its subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements (including, in the case of
the UK Subsidiary, UK GAAP) and reflect only actual transactions.

(c) The Company and its subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company has (i) implemented disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SECÂ’s rules and forms and is accumulated and
made known to the management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation, to the CompanyÂ’s outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial
reporting. A summary of any of those disclosures made by management to the
CompanyÂ’s auditors and audit committee is set forth in _Section 4.04(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_. The CompanyÂ’s internal controls and
reporting systems are adequate in light of applicable Laws.

(d) Since December 31, 2007, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its subsidiaries,

 



22  whether or not employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or its subsidiaries or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company or
its subsidiaries. As used in this Agreement, (x) "the CompanyÂ’s knowledge,"

means the actual knowledge of any of the officers of the Company (as defined
below), following the exercise of reasonable diligence in the course of their
executive and management responsibilities, and (y) "officers" of or with
respect to the Company, means the following persons: the CompanyÂ’s Chief
Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting
Officer, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel and the President and
Chief Operating Officer of TradeStation Securities, Inc. (for the respective
time periods such positions have been held). 

(e) There are no liabilities or obligations of any nature of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
other than (i) liabilities disclosed in the CompanyÂ’s consolidated financial
statements or notes as of December 31, 2010 included in the CompanyÂ’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and (ii) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2010 (and none
of those liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business are
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company).
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any material joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where
the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the CompanyÂ’s or
such subsidiaryÂ’s published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents. None of the CompanyÂ’s subsidiaries are, or have at any time since
December 31, 2007 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

(f) The Company has provided Parent true and complete copies of all management
letters received from its independent auditors since December 31, 2007, and
if no such management letters have been received, the Company has provided
copies of all correspondence from its independent auditors during such period
relating to subject matter of the same type as would be included in a
management letter.

(g) Since December 31, 2007, each of the Company and its subsidiaries has
timely filed (giving effect to all permitted extensions) all material reports,
registrations, statements and other filings, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that were required to be filed with
any SRO or Governmental Authority, other than the Company SEC Documents
(each, a "Company Report"). As of their respective dates (and without

 



23  giving effect to any amendments or modifications filed after the date of
this Agreement), each of the Company Reports (i) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
complied in all material respects with the applicable statutes, rules,
regulations and orders enforced or promulgated by the SRO or Governmental
Authority with which they were filed.

(h) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made
all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has
arranged or modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The
Company is otherwise in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ.

has not been any event, circumstance, change or effect that has had or
reasonably could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
(b) the business of the Company and its subsidiaries has been conducted only
in the ordinary course, and (c) none of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has taken any action, or entered into any transaction, and no
event has occurred, that would have required ParentÂ’s consent pursuant to
Section 6.01 if such action had been taken, transaction entered into, or
event had occurred, in each case, after the date of this Agreement, nor has
the Company or any of its subsidiaries entered into any agreement, plan or
arrangement to do any of the foregoing, except as otherwise disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed from December 31, 2010 through the date hereof and
in _Section 4.04(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

Section 4.05 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company in writing expressly for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Company Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing
thereof or of the meeting at which the Company Shareholder Approval is to be
taken or at the date of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with
respect to the Company (including its officers, directors and subsidiaries)
shall occur that is required

 



24  to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Company Proxy
Statement, the Company shall notify Parent thereof and such event shall be so
described. Any such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, as and to the extent required by applicable Laws, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company, and such amendment or supplement shall comply in
all material respects with all provisions of applicable Laws. The Company
Proxy Statement will (with respect to the information about the Company, its
officers, directors and subsidiaries that the Company is asked to provide or
review and approve) comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The
information supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion in the Offer
Documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 of the
Exchange Act and any other applicable federal securities Laws and will not,
when filed with the SEC or distributed or disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s
shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to statements made in the Schedule
14D-9 based on information furnished by Parent or Merger Sub expressly for
inclusion therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective representatives expressly for

(v) any current or former employment or executive compensation or severance
agreements (including any agreement providing for salary reductions), written
or otherwise, of the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any Company ERISA
Affiliate, or relating to any present or former employee, consultant or

Affiliate (together, the "Company Employee Plans") for which the Company or
any subsidiary may have liability.

(b) The Company has provided to Parent a copy if in writing or, if oral, a

material employee communications relating thereto, if applicable) and has,
with respect to each of the Company Employee Plans which is subject to
ERISA reporting requirements, provided copies of the Form 5500 reports,

years. Any of the Company Employee Plans intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a
favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code
(which has not been revoked, modified or limited). The Company has also
furnished Parent with a copy of the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan,
and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter which could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax-qualified status of any
of the Company Employee Plans subject to Code Section 401(a).

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to Parent or the Company or its subsidiaries, each of the Company
Employee Plans is, and its administration (including with respect to reporting

of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code, or Title IV of

any applicable Law with respect to any such plan.

(g) (i) No Company Employee Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" as defined

of such "employee benefit plan" or "plan"), (ii) sponsor any master or
prototype plans or individual retirement accounts, or (iii) have any
prohibited transaction individual exemptions from the U.S. Department of

Company Employee Plan or any successor thereto, to any material tax, fine,
penalty or other liability (other than to make contributions and payments in
the ordinary course). Except as listed in _Section 4.06 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, no Company Employee Plan exists which could result in
the payment of money or any other property or rights, or accelerate or

requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto.

lockouts or other similar labor disputes, nor have there been any such
actions within the past five years. There are no audits or investigations of
any material respect by, or consent decrees with, any Governmental Authority
relating to the CompanyÂ’s or its subsidiariesÂ’ employees or employment
practices. To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, no employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries are in violation of any employment Contract, patent disclosure
agreement, noncompetition agreement or any restrictive covenant because of the
nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or related to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others.

enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws relating to
or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, or to
the knowledge of the Company, any other party, is in violation or breach of or
in default (nor does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time
or the giving of notice would result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation, acceleration or loss of benefits, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, rights or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries) under any Material Contract to which it is
a party or by which it or any of its properties, rights or assets is bound,
except for violations, breaches or defaults that would not have a Material

has, to the knowledge of the Company, alleged that the Company or any
subsidiary is in violation or breach of, or in default under, any such
Material Contract or has notified the Company or any subsidiary of an
intention to modify any material terms of, or not to renew, any such Material
Contract. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no material private or governmental actions, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations, claims, inquiries, examinations, inspections or
investigations pending by or before any Governmental Authority or SRO or
tribunal, or, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, threatened (including cease and
desist letters or invitations to take a patent license) against the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective properties, rights or assets,
or any of their respective officers or directors (in their capacities as
such), any of their respective "associated persons" (as defined under Rule
1011 of the rules set forth in the FINRA Manual, as adopted by the Board of
Governors of FINRA) (in their capacities as such) or, in the case of the UK
Subsidiary, any person performing "controlled functions" (as defined in
Section 59(3) of the FSMA) on behalf of the UK Subsidiary (in their capacities
as such), or otherwise affecting in any material respect the business of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is the plaintiff in any such material proceeding and neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is contemplating commencing legal action
against any other Person. The Company and its subsidiaries are not, and
within the last four years have not been, the subject of any order, judgment,
writ, injunction, decree or other directive of any court of competent
jurisdiction, SRO or other Governmental Authority permanently or temporarily
enjoining, or otherwise materially limiting any of their participation, in the
following activities: (i) acting as a futures commission merchant, retail
foreign exchange dealer, broker or dealer in securities, or engaging in
or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with such activity, (ii)
engaging in any type of business practice, or (iii) engaging in any activity
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, or which otherwise
has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Since December 31, 2007, no SRO or Governmental Authority has
requested that the Company or any of its subsidiaries enter into a settlement
negotiation or tolling agreement with respect to any matter related to any
subpoena, written demand, inquiry or information request, which has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(b) _Section 4.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists all
indemnification obligations of the Company or any subsidiary (including, for
purposes of this Section, any expense reimbursement provisions) or any
provisions of similar proposed effect (including contribution agreements)
other than provisions contained in Contracts entered into by the Company or
its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

 



32 Section 4.10 Compliance with Applicable Law.

 

(a) The Company and its subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with all applicable Laws, and are not in violation in any material respect
of, and have not received any notices of a material violation with respect to,
any applicable Laws in connection with the conduct of their business or the
ownership or operation of their business, assets, rights and properties.

(b) The Company and its subsidiaries have obtained and currently hold all
material licenses, permits, certificates, franchises, approvals and other
authorizations and have made all filings, applications and registrations with
all SROs and Governmental Authorities (collectively, the "Company Permits")
necessary for the ownership, lease or use of their assets, rights and
properties and the conduct of their business. The Company and its subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with, and are not in violation in any
material respect of, any Company Permit and all Company Permits are in full
force and effect. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no proposed change
in any applicable Laws which would require the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to obtain any Company Permits not currently held by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries in order to conduct, in all material respects,
their respective businesses as presently conducted. No proceedings by any SROs
or Governmental Authorities are pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened which seek to revoke or materially limit any of the
Company Permits. Except as set forth in Section 4.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no unresolved, material criticism, violation or
exception by any SRO or Governmental Authority with respect to any report,
registration or other statement or document filed by, or relating to any
examinations by any such SRO or Governmental Authority of, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Section 4.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a
description of each order, writ, judgment, ruling, injunction, decree,
stipulation, determination, award or other directive entered by or with any
SRO or Governmental Authority currently in effect (each, a "Governmental
Order") applicable to (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) to
the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, any director, officer or employee of the Company or
its subsidiaries, any of their respective associated persons or, in the case
of the UK Subsidiary, any person performing "controlled functions" on behalf
of the UK Subsidiary, in each case in this clause (ii), as it relates to the
CompanyÂ’s or any of its subsidiariesÂ’ business or operations. No such
Governmental Order has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 4.11 Properties.

 

(a) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries owns any real property.
With respect to real property leased by the Company or its subsidiaries or
otherwise made available to the Company or its subsidiaries for its use, the
Company or its applicable subsidiary has a valid leasehold or sublease
interest or other comparable contract rights in, or relating to,
such property, the right to quiet enjoyment of such real property for the
full term of its lease (and any renewal option related thereto), and the
leasehold or other interest of the Company or its subsidiaries in such real
property is not subject or subordinate to any Lien (or if subordinate, a

 



33  non-disturbance agreement has been obtained by the Company or its
subsidiaries from the holder of the Lien). The Company and its subsidiaries
are in compliance in all material respects with each such lease or similar
agreement and, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, the other party or parties thereto
are not in default of its or their obligations thereunder, nor does any such
third party have the right to terminate prior to its scheduled expiration the
term of any lease or similar agreement. A copy of all real property leases of
the Company and its subsidiaries have been delivered or otherwise provided to
Parent by the Company and are set forth in _Section 4.11 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_.

(b) Neither the whole nor any part of any real property leased, used or
occupied by the Company or its subsidiaries is subject to any pending suit
for condemnation or other taking by any public authority, or any other matter
materially adversely affecting the current use, occupancy or value thereof,
and no such condemnation, taking or other matter is, to the CompanyÂ’s
knowledge, currently threatened or contemplated. The properties and other
tangible assets necessary for the conduct of the business that are owned,
leased or subleased by the Company or its subsidiaries are sufficient in all
material respects to conduct the operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries as currently conducted, and the foregoing are in good operating
condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. There has not been
any interruption of the operations of the Company or its subsidiaries due to
inadequate maintenance of any such properties.

(c) With respect to any real property leased or subleased by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to a third party, the Company or such subsidiary, as
the case may be, and, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, each such third party, are
in compliance in all material respects with each such lease or sublease or
similar agreement and the Company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, and,
to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, no such third party is in default of any of its
obligations thereunder, nor does any such third party have the right to
terminate prior to the scheduled expiration the term of any such lease,
sublease or similar agreement.

 

Section 4.12 Tax Matters.

(a) As used herein, "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes" and
"Taxable") shall mean any and all taxes, fees, levies, duties, tariffs,
imposts, and other charges of any kind in the nature thereof (together with
any and all interest, penalties, additions to tax and additional amounts
imposed with respect thereto) imposed by any government or taxing authority,
including: taxes or other charges on or with respect to income, franchises,
windfall or other profits, gross receipts, property, sales, use, capital
stock, payroll, employment, social security, workersÂ’ compensation,
unemployment compensation, or net worth; taxes or other charges in the nature

respect to any Tax (including any attached schedules), including any
information return, claim for refund, amended return or declaration
of estimated Tax and all federal, state, local and foreign returns, reports
and similar statements.

 



34 (b) The Company and its subsidiaries have timely filed all income and
other material Tax Returns required to be filed (after giving effect to any
filing extensions granted by any Governmental Authority) and all such Tax
Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes
owed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any
Tax Return) have been paid within the time and in the manner prescribed by Law
(other than those that are being contested in good faith through appropriate
proceedings and, in the case of those that are being contested as of the date
hereof, for which appropriate reserves have been established in accordance
with GAAP). Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company
or any of its subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens or security
interests on any of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that
arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.

"reportable payments" and (ii) withholding requirements pursuant to Code
Sections 1441 and 1442 (in each case, and any similar provision under any
state, local or foreign Law) with respect to any fixed or determinable annual
or periodical income.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, no review or audit is currently in progress, pending or threatened
by any Tax authority as to which the Company has knowledge. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries expects any Tax authority to assess
any material additional Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been
filed. There is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax liability of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised by any Tax
authority in writing or (ii) as to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has knowledge. _Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ lists all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are filed with respect
to the Company and its subsidiaries and indicates those Tax Returns that have
been audited or that are currently the subject of audit. The Company and its
subsidiaries have delivered or otherwise made available to the Parent correct
and complete copies of all income and franchise Tax Returns, examination
reports, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the
Company since December 31, 2007.

 



35 (f) No power of attorney granted by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force.

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries, or any director, officer, employee or associated persons of the

prevent or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein.

Section 5.04 Reports and Financial Statements. The financial statements of
Parent included in ParentÂ’s (a) Annual Report for the year ended March 31,

previously provided to the Company, have been prepared in accordance

 



47  with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan during the periods
involved and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows (other than for the unaudited

recurring audit adjustments not material in amount).

Section 5.05 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be

incorporation by reference in the Company Proxy Statement will, at the time of
the mailing thereof or of the meeting at which Company Shareholder Approval
is to be taken, or at the date of any amendment thereof or supplement thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with
respect to Parent or Merger Sub (including their respective officers,
directors and subsidiaries) shall occur that is required to be described in
an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Company Proxy Statement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company thereof and such event shall be
so described. Any such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed with
the SEC and, as and to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company, and such amendment or supplement shall comply in
all material respects with all provisions of applicable Law. The
Offer Documents (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not,
when filed with the SEC or at the time of distribution or dissemination
thereof to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Offer
Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
federal securities Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its respective representatives for inclusion in the Offer
Documents or the Company Proxy Statement.

Section 5.07 Sufficient Funds. As of the date hereof, Parent has sufficient
funds available to it, and at the Offer Closing and immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will have sufficient funds, to pay the
aggregate Offer Price and the Merger Consideration contemplated by this
Agreement and to perform all of the other agreements and obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub contemplated by this Agreement. In addition and
without limiting the foregoing in any manner, no event, circumstance or change
has occurred since the date hereof and prior to the Offer Closing and
continued in existence for the earlier to occur of (i) 20 Business Days after
such event, circumstance or change has occurred or (ii) the Expiration Time,
in either case that would prevent

 



48  Parent from consummating the Offer by the Expiration Time as a result of
ParentÂ’s failure to have sufficient funds available to it to pay the aggregate
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement and
to perform all of the other agreements and obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.08 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial adviser or other
Person, other than Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., the fees and expenses of

on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub. 

Section 5.09 Legal Proceedings. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened, legal action, proceeding, investigation, claims, inquiry,
inspection or examination against Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree or
other directive imposed upon Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub, in each case, by or before any Governmental Authority, that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.10 Ownership of Company Common Stock. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries beneficially owns (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like,

any of, the foregoing actions or any action that would result in a breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement as
of the date when made or as of any future date or would result in any of the
conditions to the Offer or the Merger not being satisfied or in a material
delay of the satisfaction of such conditions.

Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s rights or obligations under this
Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Offer Closing and
(b) prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its operations.

 

Section 6.02 No Solicitation. From the date hereof until the Effective Time:

 

(a) The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
its and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents to immediately cease, any and all discussions or negotiations with any
parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and request
the return or destruction of all confidential information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries provided to any such Persons on or

 



53  prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant and subject to the terms of any
confidentiality or similar agreements with those parties. The Company shall
not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents to not, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, participate in or encourage (including by
way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed or
reasonably likely to facilitate or encourage, any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations (including by way of furnishing information) regarding any
Takeover Proposal; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the
Offer Closing, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial adviser of nationally recognized
reputation, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders under applicable Law, the
Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited on or
subsequent to the date hereof, and subject to compliance with this Section
6.02, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries
to the Person making such Superior Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement no less restrictive on the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement is on Parent, provided that the Company also provides concurrently
to Parent any such information not previously provided and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding such Superior Proposal.

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.02(b) or Section 6.02(c), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw or modify,
or propose to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board or such committee of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement or
take no position with respect to any of the foregoing or (B) take any other
action or make any other public statement in connection with the Offer, the
Company Shareholder Meeting, or in reference to a Takeover Proposal, that is
inconsistent with such recommendation (any such action or public statement
described in clause (A) or (B) being referred to as a "Change of
Recommendation")), (ii) approve or recommend or take no position with respect
to, or propose to approve or recommend or take no position with respect to,
any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Proposal Documentation, or (iii) cause the
Company to enter into any Takeover Proposal Documentation. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial adviser of
nationally recognized reputation, that it is required to do so to prevent the
Company Board from breaching its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, the Company Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation, but only (A) at a time that is after the third (3rd) Business
Day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board proposes to withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation
and the reason or reasons it proposes to take such action, (B) if during such
three (3) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated in good faith, and
caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith, with
Parent with respect to any revised proposal from Parent in respect of the
terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to obviate
the need to make such Change of Recommendation, and (C) if the Company has not
acted in

 



54  violation in any material respect of its obligations in this Section 6.02.
If the Company Board proposes to take such action in relation to a Takeover
Proposal, then the Company shall also comply with Section 6.02(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII, (i) the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Takeover Proposal other
than the Merger, and (ii) the Company shall not (without ParentÂ’s prior
written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone
or cancel) the Company Shareholder Meeting, except to the extent required to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval. If the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders is required under applicable Law, the
Company Proxy Statement shall also include the recommendation of the Company
Board in favor of any matters required to be submitted to the shareholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14a-21 under the Exchange Act.

 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or
recommend, or take no position with respect to, or propose to approve or
recommend, or take no position with respect to, any Takeover Proposal or
Takeover Proposal Documentation, or (ii) execute (or allow the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to execute) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement or documentation constituting or relating to a
Takeover Proposal (any such agreement or documentation, other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.02(a), "Takeover Proposal
Documentation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Section 6.02 to the contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing
(but after the expiration of the Notice Period (as defined below)), the
Company Board determines, in response to a Takeover Proposal that was
unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
6.02, that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal (after giving effect
to all of the adjustments to this Agreement which may be offered by Parent
during the Notice Period or otherwise), the Company may terminate this
Agreement in order to enter into or execute a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.02(c), and any
such action shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior
to or concurrently with taking such action pays to Parent the fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.06; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.02(c) or effect a
Change of Recommendation in relation to a Takeover Proposal pursuant to
Section 6.02(b) unless (A) the Company has provided a written notice to
Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal and specifying the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof, together with copies
of any written offer or proposal in respect of such Superior Proposal, and (B)
Parent does not, within three Business Days following its receipt of the
Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make an offer that, as
determined by the Company Board, results in the applicable Takeover Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that, during the Notice
Period, the Company shall, if so requested by Parent, negotiate in good
faith, and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good

 



55  faith, with Parent with respect to any revised proposal from Parent in
respect of the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), it
being further understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms
or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require the delivery
to Parent of a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period.

 

(d) As used herein, "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal, offer or
expression of interest by any third party (other than Parent or any of its
subsidiaries) relating to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization or other business combination
involving the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any purchase or
sale of more than 15% of the consolidated assets, business, revenues or net
income of the Company (including the shares and assets of its subsidiaries) or
any issuance, purchase or sale of any of the shares of Company Common
Stock (other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding on the date hereof in accordance with their terms) or the
issuance, purchase or sale of any securities, rights to acquire securities
(other than in connection with Company Performance Share Awards and
Restricted Stock Awards to the extent permitted by this Agreement) or voting
interests of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any similar
transaction, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Any material
modification of a Takeover Proposal (including any modification of the
economic terms) shall constitute a new Takeover Proposal. As used herein, a
"Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal for a
transaction in which all of the stock of the Company or all or substantially
all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, are acquired by a third party, including by tender offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination, on terms that the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside
counsel and a financial adviser of nationally recognized reputation) to be
more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders, from a financial point of view,
than the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all aspects of the
proposal, the party making the proposal and any changes to the Offer and/or
the Merger proposed by Parent in response to the receipt by the Company of
such Superior Proposal) and which is not subject to any material contingency
on the part of the third party, including any contingency related to
financing, unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, such
contingency is reasonably capable of being satisfied by such third party, and
which is otherwise reasonably capable of being consummated in a timely
fashion.

(e) The Company shall advise Parent, orally and in writing as promptly as
practicable but in any event within 24 hours after receipt of such Takeover
Proposal, of such Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal. The Company will inform Parent of any material change in the details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Takeover Proposal as
promptly as practicable but in any event within 24 hours after receipt
of such material change in details. The Company will promptly provide Parent
with any documents received from any such Person and promptly provide Parent
such additional information as it may reasonably request.

 



56 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of
a tender offer or exchange offer) if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement, (ii) neither the Company nor
the Company Board may make any Change of Recommendation unless permitted
by Section 6.02(b), and (iii) any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation
unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the
recommendation by the Company Board of the Merger and this Agreement.

Section 6.03 Company Proxy Statement. If the approval of the Merger by the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders is required by applicable Law, as soon as practicable
following the Offer Closing, the Company shall prepare and file the Company
Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate and consult with each other and use reasonable best efforts in the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file the Company
Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and such comments shall be reasonably considered by the
Company). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and
each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party and use
reasonable best efforts in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and
to cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the
SEC and mailed to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to consult with
Parent prior to responding to SEC comments with respect to the preliminary
Company Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Company
Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall promptly
prepare and mail to its shareholders an amendment or supplement setting forth
such correction. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, (i)
notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Company Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent
with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement.

 



57 Section 6.04 Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to the terms set forth
in this Agreement (including Section 6.02(b)), if the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the CompanyÂ’s shareholders is required under
applicable Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the Offer
Closing, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") solely
(unless the timing of proposing the Company Shareholder Approval would also be
the timing of the CompanyÂ’s annual meeting of shareholders) for the purposes
of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and any matters required to be
submitted to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14a-21 under the
Exchange Act and shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.02(b),
through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
6.02(b) and this Section 6.04, the Company shall use its best efforts to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval as promptly as practicable. Parent
shall, and shall cause Merger Sub and any other subsidiaries of Parent to
vote, all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned of record by Merger
Sub, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries (other than shares in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit of customers or clients) in
favor of the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer
Closing and any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the
Top-Up Option, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries shall
hold, in the aggregate, at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for
the benefit of customers or clients), the parties hereto shall take all
necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to
Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity for the benefit of customers or clients), to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer Closing without
the Company Shareholder Meeting in accordance with Section 607.1104 of the
FBCA.

Section 6.05 Access to Information. The Company shall, throughout the period
from the date hereof through the Effective Time, (i) provide Parent and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, financial
advisers, lenders, consultants and other representatives (together, its
"Representatives") with full access, upon reasonable prior notice, to all
personnel, officers, employees, agents, accountants, properties (including for
the purpose of environmental testing), assets and facilities of the Company
and its subsidiaries and the books and records relating to the Company and its
subsidiaries, and (ii) promptly furnish Parent and its Representatives with
all such information and data (including copies of Contracts and other books
and records) concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries as Parent or any of such Representatives
reasonably may request in connection with such investigation. All such 

 



58  information shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2010, between Parent and
the Company (as amended to date, the "Confidentiality Agreement"). No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.05 or information provided or
received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the
representations or warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement.

Section 6.06 Notice Obligations. From time to time prior to the Offer Closing
Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing with respect to any matter
that would cause or constitute a breach in any material respect of the
CompanyÂ’s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein or that would cause a condition to the Offer Closing not to be
satisfied. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall promptly inform
Parent of any claim by a third party that a Material Contract has been
breached, is in default, may not be renewed or that a consent would be
required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company will consult with Parent a reasonable time prior to making publicly
available its financial results or filing any corresponding report with the
SEC.

Section 6.07 All Reasonable Efforts.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws, to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as promptly as
practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement filing with
the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice the notification and report form under the HSR Act required for
the transactions contemplated herein and, thereafter, furnishing as promptly
as reasonably practicable any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act, and, if
required, the notification and filing with CFIUS. The Company and Parent each
shall comply as promptly as practicable with any other Laws, rules,
regulations and ordinances of any SRO or Governmental Authority that are
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated herein and pursuant to
which any consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any SRO or Governmental Authority or any other
Person in connection with such transactions is necessary, including
satisfying any continuance in membership requirements of Rule 1017 of FINRA.
In connection with seeking such approval (or equivalent action or non-action)
from FINRA, and from any other SRO from which it is required in connection
with the change in control contemplated by this Agreement (other than the FSA
or any other SRO the rules or other guidelines of which provide for submission
of applications or other approval documentation by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries), the Company shall lead that process, with Parent being fully
and promptly informed of the process and fully and promptly providing all
information, filings and signed documents requested by the SRO or reasonably
requested by the Company to complete successfully such process, and such
applications shall state words to the effect

 



59  that: (i) no direct change in control of any of the regulated subsidiaries
is occurring, (ii) in connection with the change in control of such regulated
subsidiariesÂ’ parent company (i.e., the Company), the Company is the
surviving corporation and will continue its existence, and continue to own
100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of such regulated
subsidiaries, the only difference being Parent replacing, as shareholder of
the Company, the previous public shareholders, (iii) there will be no name
change of the Company or any of its regulated subsidiaries as a result of the
change in control, and (iv) there are no contemplated changes, immediately
following the change of control, of the officers, directors, registered
executive principals, supervisory personnel, business model, policies,
procedures, operations, systems or method of doing business of or with respect
to any of the regulated subsidiaries. The Company shall not submit any such
applications, filings or other documents, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, without providing Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such comments shall be
reasonably considered by the Company). The Company agrees to consult with
Parent prior to responding to any comments or requests with respect to such
applications, filings or other documents and to reasonably consider its
comments. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, (A) notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments or requests from FINRA or such SRO with
respect to such applications, filings or other documents and any request
by FINRA or such SRO for any amendment to the applications or filings or for
additional information and (B) provide Parent with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and FINRA or such SRO, on the other hand, with respect to the such
applications, filings or other documents. The Company and Parent each shall
furnish to the others such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may request in connection with their preparation of any necessary
filing, registration or declaration with any Governmental Authority or SRO,
including under the HSR Act or required by, or appropriate with respect to,
CFIUS. The Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any SRO or Governmental Authority (or other Person regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in respect of any such
filing, registration or declaration, and shall comply promptly with any such
inquiry or request (and, unless precluded by Law, provide copies of any such
communications that are in writing). Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the parties shall use all reasonable efforts and take all
necessary action to obtain any approval, if required, by CFIUS, or any SRO,
and any clearance under the HSR Act, or any other consent, approval, order or
authorization of any Governmental Authority under United States or foreign
antitrust or competition Laws, necessary in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, or to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or SRO with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Offer Closing and the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable, including by defending against any lawsuits,
actions or proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions

 



60  contemplated herein, and seeking to have any preliminary injunction,
temporary restraining order, stay or other legal restraint or prohibition
entered or imposed by any court or other SRO or Governmental Authority that
is not yet final and nonappealable vacated or reversed.

(c) The Company and Parent will cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to
obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, approvals and waivers required
by third parties so that all Company Permits and Contracts of the Company and
its subsidiaries will remain in full force and effect after the Effective
Time.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required by antitrust or
competition Laws or in connection with any other approval or consent of any
SRO, Governmental Authority or other Person to take, or agree to take, any
materially adverse action or suffer any material limitation or divestiture
with respect to the ownership or holding of any of their respective businesses
or assets (including, following the Offer Closing or the Effective Time, any
of the material businesses or assets of the Surviving Entity and its
subsidiaries) (and neither the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall take
any such action, or agree to do so, with respect to any of their respective
businesses or assets without the prior written consent of Parent), (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action by antitrust or competition Laws or in connection with any other
approval or consent of any SRO, Governmental Authority or other Person that
would, or could reasonably be expected to, substantially impair the benefits
expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to be realized by Parent from
consummation of the Offer and the Merger (and neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries shall take any such actions, or agree to do so, without the
prior written consent of Parent), and (iii) no party to this Agreement shall
be required to waive any of the Offer Conditions set forth on Exhibit A or any
of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII as they apply to
such party.

Section 6.08 Indemnification; Insurance.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers (the "Indemnified Parties") of the
Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents), shall survive
the Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, together with all other indemnification
agreements in favor of such Indemnified Parties that are set forth in 
_Section 6.08(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. To the extent that the
Surviving Entity cannot satisfy such indemnity obligations, Parent covenants
and agrees that it shall assume and if necessary satisfy such obligations. 

(b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering those directors and officers who are
currently covered by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy (a copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent)
(or, in lieu of maintaining such insurance, cause coverage to be provided
under any

 



61  policy maintained for the benefit of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or
otherwise obtained by Parent, as long as the terms thereof are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries thereof than those of the
CompanyÂ’s policy, or if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage). In lieu of the foregoing, Parent
may purchase six-year "tail" coverage covering acts or omissions prior to the
Effective Time on substantially similar terms to the existing policy of the
Company, or if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage. In satisfying its obligations under this Section
6.08(b), neither the Surviving Entity nor Parent shall be obligated to pay
more than the amount set forth in _Section 6.08(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_. It is understood and agreed that, in the event such coverage
cannot be obtained for such amount or less in the aggregate, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall only be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such amount set forth in _Section 6.08(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_.

(c) This Section 6.08 shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger, is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, each of whom shall
have the right, as an express third-party beneficiary, to directly enforce
this Section 6.08, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Entity.

Section 6.09 Publicity. Except as otherwise required by Law, court process or
the rules of any applicable securities exchange or national quotation system
or as contemplated or provided elsewhere herein, neither the Company nor
Parent shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without prior consultation with, and review by, the other
and shall give reasonable consideration to all comments of the other party.
The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

Section 6.10 Tax Matters.

(a) The Company and its subsidiaries shall prepare the Tax Returns for all
pre-Closing periods required to be filed by the Company and its subsidiaries,
and shall pay all Taxes (including estimated Taxes) due on such Tax Returns
(or due with respect to Tax Returns for which an extension has been granted as
permitted hereunder) or which are otherwise required to be paid at any time
prior to or during such period. Such Tax Returns filed after the date of this
Agreement shall be prepared in accordance with the most recent Tax practices
and shall be submitted to Parent for its review and approval, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, no later than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account proper extensions).

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, to the extent
that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has knowledge of the commencement
or scheduling of any Tax audit, the assessment of any Tax, the issuance of any
notice of Tax due or any bill for 

 



62  collection of any Tax due or the commencement or scheduling of any other
administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to the determination,
assessment or collection of any Tax of the Company, the Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent of such matter, setting forth information (to the
extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and
including copies of any notice or other documentation received from the
applicable Tax authority with respect to such matter.

Section 6.11 Employment Matters.

 

(a) For the period from the Offer Closing Date (assuming ParentÂ’s designees
represent a majority of the Company Board at such time, and otherwise from
the Effective Time or such earlier time as ParentÂ’s designees represent a
majority of the Company Board) through at least twelve (12) months following
the Offer Closing Date, Parent shall provide, and cause the Surviving Entity
to provide: (i) annual rates of base salary or wages, as applicable, that are
at least equal to those in effect immediately prior to the Offer Closing Date
and (ii) annual cash bonus opportunities and other employee benefits under
employee benefit plans (other than any Company Incentive Equity Plans) to the
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no
less favorable than those provided to such employees and their
eligible dependents by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing pursuant to the applicable Company Employee Plan. Nothing herein
shall require Parent to continue any particular plan, program or arrangement
or prevent the amendment or termination thereof.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans (other than any Company
Incentive Equity Plans) in which any employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries first become eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date
and in which the Company employees did not participate prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the employees and their eligible dependents of the Company and
its subsidiaries under any such new plans in which such employees and their
eligible dependents may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date,
except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would apply under the analogous Company Employee Plan, (ii)
provide each employee of the Company and its subsidiaries and eligible
dependents of such employees with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Closing Date (to the same extent such credit was given under
the analogous Company Employee Plan prior the Closing Date) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such new plan in
which such employees and their eligible dependents may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting in any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.

 



63 (c) This Agreement is not intended by the parties to (i) constitute
an amendment to a Company Employee Plan, (ii) give any third party, including
any Company employee, any right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement
(including this Section 6.11), (iii) obligate Parent, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Surviving Entity), to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan,
program or policy or (iv) create any obligations of the parties with respect
to any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Company or its subsidiaries.

Section 6.12 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all reasonable steps as may be required or permitted to cause to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of
shares of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Stock Awards, or Company
Stock Options, Company Performance Share Awards or other derivative securities
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock) that occur or are deemed to
occur by reason of or pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
including by taking steps in accordance with the No-Action Letter, dated
January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

Section 6.13 Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company
(acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board (which the
Company represents to Parent will be composed solely of "independent
directors" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act and the instructions thereto) shall take all such steps as may be
required to (i) cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of
the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to which compensation, consideration or payments are to
be made or payable or benefits are to be delivered to such officer, director
or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act and (ii) otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act with
respect to each such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

Section 6.14 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assumptions or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of
the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired,
and the obligations to be assumed, by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger.

Section 6.15 Other Actions. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth in Article VIII

 



64  and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall not knowingly take, and shall not permit any of their
respective subsidiaries to knowingly take, or agree or commit to take, any
action that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein. 

Section 6.16 Shareholder Litigation. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with the terms set forth in Article VIII, the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed nor any unreasonable conditions placed upon.

Section 6.17 Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board shall (a)
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover or similar Law
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) if any state
takeover or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and hereby agrees
that the provisions of this Section 8.06 are an integral part of the

The parties agree that, (i) in the event that Parent is entitled to receive

of ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
for any termination of this Agreement and (ii) in the event that the Company
is entitled to receive its Expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the right of
the Company to receive such amount shall constitute the CompanyÂ’s sole and
exclusive remedy for monetary damages for any termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing sentence shall
constitute a waiver of or limitation on the applicable partyÂ’s right (A) under
Section 8.05 to seek and obtain monetary damages resulting from fraud or the
knowing and intentional material breach by another party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement or (B) to seek and obtain specific performance in accordance with
Section 9.11 of this Agreement.

(f) Except as provided in Sections 8.06(a) through (d), all Expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses; _provided, however_ , that
the Company and Parent shall share equally all filing fees payable pursuant to
the HSR Act. 

Section 8.07 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 1.03(c), this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after the Offer Closing or after receipt of the Company Shareholder

amendments shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
holders without obtaining such further approval.

 



70 Section 8.08 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
may, subject to Section 1.03(c), (a) extend the time for the performance of

the representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in this

compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that, after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, no waiver shall be made which by Law requires further
approval by such holders without obtaining such further approval. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub

Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations

review of the transaction, then review pursuant to the Exon-Florio Amendment
of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall have concluded, with
no action having been taken by the President of the United States to block or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) The approvals and consents of FINRA and FSA with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained and shall
remain in full force and effect and any other statutory waiting periods in
respect thereof shall have expired or been terminated; and

(iv) all other approvals and consents of any SRO or Governmental Authority in,
of or with jurisdiction in, the United States or the United Kingdom required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been
obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and any other statutory
waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired or been terminated,
other than those approvals, consents and waiting periods the failure of which
to be obtained, expired or terminated would not be material to the business or
operations of the Company (or the Surviving Entity) and its subsidiaries, or
Parent and its subsidiaries (all of the approvals, consents and, with respect
to CFIUS, reviews and the expiration or termination of all such waiting
periods referenced in this clause (b), being collectively referred to in the
Agreement as the "Required Regulatory Approvals"). shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law making
illegal, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger substantially in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 
---|--- 



   (d) | There shall not be instituted or pending any actions, suits or
proceedings by any SRO or Governmental Authority that seeks to make illegal,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

   (e) | (i) The representations and warranties of the Company contained
in Section 4.04(i)(a) of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all

contained in Section 4.02(a) of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects when made and at the then-scheduled Expiration Time as if

that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct in
all material respects as of such date or time), and (iii) all other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement shall
be true and correct (without giving effect to any exception or qualification
in such representations and warranties relating to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect) when made and at the then-scheduled Expiration Time as if made
at and as of such time, except any such representations and warranties that
relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of
such date or time); _provided_ that the condition set forth in this clause
(e)(iii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied and met unless the impact of
the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company contained
in the Agreement to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would likely have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 
---|---

material respects, all agreements and covenants required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the then-scheduled
