ARTICLE  II

 

_THE  OFFER_

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _The  Offer_.  (a)  Provided  that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with Section  9.01 and that none of
the events set forth in clauses (a) through (i) of  Annex A hereto shall have
occurred or be continuing, Purchaser shall  commence the Offer as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof,  but in no event later than
five (5) business days after the initial public  announcement of Purchaser's
intention to commence the Offer. The obligation of  Purchaser to accept for
payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall  be  subject to (i) the
condition (the " _Minimum  Condition_ ")  that  at least the number of
Shares that shall constitute a majority of the then  outstanding Shares on a
Fully Diluted Basis shall have been validly tendered  and  not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer and (ii) the satisfaction  of  each of
the other conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Purchaser expressly 
reserves the right to waive any such condition, to increase the price per
Share  payable in the Offer, and to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions  of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  unless
previously approved by the Company in writing no change may be made  that 
(i) amends or waives the Minimum Condition, (ii) decreases the price per
Share  payable in the Offer, (iii) changes the form of consideration to be
paid in  the  Offer, (iv) reduces the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer,  (v) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to
those set forth in Annex  A  hereto, (vi) amends the conditions to the Offer
set forth in Annex A so as  to broaden the scope of such conditions to the
Offer, (vii) extends, except  as  provided for below, the Offer or (viii)
makes any other change to any of the  terms and conditions of the Offer that
is adverse to the holders of Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall from time to time, (i) extend  the  Offer, until such time
as either (A) all of the conditions to the Offer  have been satisfied or
waived or (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant  to Section 9.01, for one
or more periods of not more than ten (10) business  days  each beyond the
scheduled expiration date, which initially shall be 20 business  days
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange  Act_ ")) 
following the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated 
under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial  Expiration Date_ "), 
if,  at the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent scheduled expiration of
the  Offer, any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for
payment  Shares, shall not be satisfied or waived or (ii) extend the Offer
for any period  required by any rule, regulation, position or interpretation
of the Securities  and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "),  or  the staff
thereof or of the NASDAQ, applicable to the Offer. The Per Share  Amount
shall, subject only to applicable withholding of taxes, be net to the  seller
in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. 
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, pay for all Shares
validly  tendered and not withdrawn as promptly as practicable following the
acceptance  of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer. Notwithstanding the
immediately  preceding sentence and subject to the applicable rules of the
SEC and the terms  and conditions of the Offer, Purchaser expressly reserves
the right to delay  payment for Shares solely in order to comply in whole or
in part with applicable  Laws. Any such delay shall be effected in compliance
with Rule 14e--1(c)  promulgated under the Exchange Act. Purchaser may, and
the Offer Documents  (as  defined below) shall reserve the right to, extend
the Offer after the acceptance  of Shares thereunder for a further period of
time by means of a subsequent  offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act of not  less  than three nor more than 20 business
days to meet the objective that there  be  validly tendered, in accordance
with the terms of the Offer, prior to the  expiration of the Offer (as so
extended), and not withdrawn a number of Shares  which, together with Shares
then owned by Parent and Purchaser, represents  at  least 90% of the then
outstanding Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis. If the  payment equal to the Per
Share Amount in cash is to be made to a person other  than the person in
whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing  Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be  a 
condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed 
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person 
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes
required  by  reason of the payment of the Per Share Amount to a person
other than the  registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall
have established  to  the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such
taxes either have been paid  or are not applicable. The Company agrees that
no Shares held by the Company  or  any Subsidiary shall be tendered in the
Offer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As  promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer,  Parent shall cause Purchaser to (i) file with the SEC a Tender
Offer  Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto,  the " _Schedule  TO_ ")  with  respect to the Offer and (ii)
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated  to all holders of Shares in
accordance with Rule 14d-4 promulgated under  the Exchange Act. The Schedule
TO shall contain or shall incorporate by  reference an offer to purchase (the
" _Offer  to Purchase_ ")  and  forms of the related letter of transmittal
and any related summary advertisement  (the Schedule TO, the Offer to
Purchase and such other documents, together  with  all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively  as  the "
_Offer  Documents_ ").  The  Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Purchaser in writing all  information concerning the Company that may be
required by applicable securities  Laws or reasonably requested by Parent for
inclusion in the Schedule TO or  the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees to correct  promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that  shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and  Purchaser further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO,  as  so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so 
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to 
the  extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and
Purchaser  shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and  comment on the Offer Documents prior to such documents being
filed with the  SEC  or disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and
Purchaser shall provide the  Company and its counsel with any comments that
Parent, Purchaser or their  counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer  Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and, subject to providing  the Company and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in  the  response of Parent or
Purchaser, shall respond to any such comments from the  SEC  regarding the
Offer Documents.

SECTION  2.02. _Company  Action_.  (a)  The  Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer and represents that the  Board, at a meeting duly
called and held on December 10, 2007, has unanimously  (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement,
including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ "),  are  fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders
of Shares, (ii) approved,  adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions (such  approval and adoption having been made in accordance
with the DGCL, including,  without limitation, Section 203 thereof) and (iii)
resolved to recommend that  the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender
their Shares pursuant to  the  Offer, and adopt this Agreement and the
Transactions. The Company hereby  consents, except to the extent withdrawn or
modified in accordance with Section  7.05(c), to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the  Board described in this Section
2.02(a), and the Company shall not withdraw  or  modify such recommendation
in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent except  to the extent permitted
by Section 7.05(c). The Company has been advised by  its  directors and
executive officers that they intend to tender all Shares  beneficially owned
by them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, except to the  extent that the
tender of Shares would result in liability under  Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder.

 

 

(b) As  promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer,  the  Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on  Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule  14D-9_ ")  containing the Fairness Opinion and,
except as provided in Section 7.05(c),  the  recommendation of the Board
described in Section 2.02(a), and shall disseminate  the Schedule 14D-9 to
the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the  Exchange Act, and
any other applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Each of  Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all  information
concerning Parent and Purchaser that may be required by applicable 
securities Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the 
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees to correct 
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which 
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company  further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as  so  corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares,  in  each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws.  The Company shall give Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review  and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to such document being filed with the  SEC or disseminated to holders
of Shares. The Company shall provide Parent  and  its counsel with any
comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from  the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the  receipt of such
comments and, subject to providing Parent and its counsel with  a 
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of the Company, shall 
respond to any such comments from the SEC regarding the  Schedule 14D-9.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) (i) The  Company shall promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing
labels  containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares
and with  security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories,
each as of  a  recent date, together with all other available listings and
computer files  containing names, addresses and security position listings of
record holders  and  beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall promptly
furnish Parent and  Purchaser with such additional information, including,
without limitation,  updated listings and computer files of stockholders,
mailing labels and security  position listings, and such other assistance in
disseminating the Offer  Documents to holders of Shares as Parent or
Purchaser may reasonably request.  (ii) Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, and except for such  steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other  documents necessary to consummate the
Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser  shall hold in confidence the
information contained in such labels, listings  and  files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Transactions,  and,  if this
Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, shall  deliver
(and shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause their agents  to
deliver) to the Company all copies and any extracts or summaries of such 
information then in their possession or control.

 

 

(d) The  Company grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "
_Merger  Option_ ")  to  purchase up to that number of newly issued Shares
(the " _Merger  Option Shares_ ")  equal  to the number of Shares that,
when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent  and Purchaser immediately
following the consummation of the Offer, shall  constitute one share more
than 90% of the Shares then outstanding on a Fully  Diluted Basis (after
giving effect to the issuance of the Merger Option Shares)  for consideration
per Merger Option Share equal to the Per Share Amount. Neither  Parent, nor
Purchaser shall exercise the Merger Option unless following such  exercise
Parent and Purchaser shall own at least 90% of the outstanding Shares.  In
the event that Parent or Purchaser exercises the Merger Option and the 
resulting issuance of the Merger Option Shares by the Company would cause
the  Company to be in breach of its listing agreement with the Nasdaq Global
Market,  Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the issuance of the
Merger Option  Shares, cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with
the terms of  this  Agreement.

 

 

(e) The  Merger Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and
payment for  Shares pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result
of which Parent  and Purchaser own beneficially at least 71% of the Shares on
a Fully Diluted  Basis.

 

 

(f) In  the  event that Parent or Purchaser wish to exercise the Merger
Option, Parent shall  give the Company one (1) business day\'s prior written
notice specifying the  number of Shares that are owned by Parent and
Purchaser immediately following  consummation of the Offer and specifying a
place and a time for the closing  of  the purchase. The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following receipt of  such notice, deliver written notice
to Purchaser specifying the number of Merger  Option Shares. At the closing
of the purchase of the Merger Option Shares,  Parent or Purchaser shall pay
to the Company an amount equal to the product  of  (i) the number of Shares
purchased pursuant to the Merger Option, multiplied  by  (ii) the Per Share

cash and delivery of a promissory note having full recourse  to  Parent, so
long as the cash portion of the consideration for each Merger Option  Share
is at least $0.001.

Incorporation.

 

 

(b) Unless  otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to  Section 7.07(a), at the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Purchaser,

Laws.

SECTION  3.06. _Conversion  of Securities_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following  securities:

 

 

(a) Each  Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other  than  any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.06(b) and
any Dissenting Shares  (as hereinafter defined)) shall be canceled and cease
to exist and shall be  converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount equal to the Per  Share Amount in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger  Consideration_ ")  payable to the holder of such Share, upon
surrender, in the manner provided  in  Section 3.10, of the certificate that
formerly evidenced such Share (or in  the  case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit  in the manner provided
in Section 3.10);

 

 

(b) Each  Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Purchaser,  Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent or of the  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any  conversion thereof and cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall  be  made with respect thereto; and

 

 

(c) Each  share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into  and  exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common  stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of
the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

SECTION  3.07. _Stock  Options_ _  and  Stock Awards_.  (a)  Effective
as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action  to
terminate the Company's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, 2003 Stock Plan, 2001 
Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, 1997 
Employee Stock Option Plan, 1997 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan, 1997
Paradise  Stock Option Plan and 1997 Sage Stock Plan, each as amended through
the date  of  this Agreement (the " _Company  Stock Plans_ ").  Neither
Parent nor Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall assume any  options
to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company  Stock Option_ ")  or  restricted
stock units (each, a " _Company  Stock Award_ ")  granted under the Company
Stock Option Plans in connection with the  Transactions. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option  that  is unexercised and each
outstanding _Company  Stock Award_ ,  whether  or not vested or exercisable
as of such date, shall be cancelled without any  action on the part of the
holder thereof. Each holder of a Company Stock Option  that is outstanding
and unexercised at the Effective Time, whether or not vested  or exercisable,
and that has an exercise price per Share that is less than  the  Per Share
Amount and each holder of a Company Stock Award that is outstanding  at  the
Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be entitled (subject to the 
provisions of this Section 3.07) to be paid by the Surviving Corporation,
with  respect to each Share subject to the Company Stock Option, an amount in
cash  equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the
applicable per  share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and, with
respect to each  Share subject to the Company Stock Award, an amount in cash
equal to the Per  Share Amount. Any such payment shall be subject to all
applicable federal,  state  and local tax withholding requirements.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each  holder of one or more Company Stock Options that are outstanding
and unexercised  at the Effective Time and that were eligible for exchange ("
_Eligible  Options_ ")  in  accordance with the terms of the Company's
Offer to Exchange Certain Outstanding  Options for Restricted Stock Units,
dated October 18, 2007 (the " _Exchange  Offer_ ")  shall  be entitled to
be paid by the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal  to  the Per
Share Amount for each Share subject to or otherwise issuable pursuant  to 
the restricted stock unit award such holder would have received had he or
she  tendered all of his or her Eligible Options in the Exchange Offer and
been  granted restricted stock unit awards in exchange therefor pursuant to
the terms  of the Exchange Offer. The cash amounts payable pursuant to this
paragraph  shall  be paid at the same time or times the corresponding
restricted stock unit awards  would have otherwise vested pursuant to the
Exchange Offer, subject to the  same  vesting requirements set forth in the
Exchange Offer, it being understood that  service with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective  subsidiaries shall constitute the
provision of services for the purposes of  vesting in the right to receive
the cash payments contemplated hereby. 

 

 

SECTION  3.08. _Employee  Stock Purchase Plan_.  The  Company shall take
all actions necessary to shorten any pending Offering Period  (as such term
is defined in the Company's 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_
"))  and  establish a New Exercise Date (as contemplated in Section 19(c) of
the ESPP)  prior to the expiration of the Offer, as of a date selected by
Parent (which  date shall be the last day of a regular payroll period of the
Company) (the  " _ESPP  Date_ ").  After  the ESPP Date, all offering and
purchase periods pending under the ESPP shall  be  terminated and no new
offering or purchasing periods shall be commenced. In  addition, the Company
shall take all actions as may be necessary in order to  freeze the rights of
the participants in the ESPP, effective as of the date  of  this Agreement,
to existing participants and (to the extent permissible under  the ESPP)
existing participation levels.

 

 

SECTION  3.09. _Dissenting  Shares_.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that  are  outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by  stockholders who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented  thereto in writing and
who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal  for  such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting 
Shares_ ")  shall  not be converted into, or represent the right to receive,
the Merger  Consideration. At the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be  outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist, and such  stockholders shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such stockholders shall be
entitled  to  receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by
them in accordance  with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares  held  by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have  withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Shares under such Section  262 or who shall be determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to not  be  entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to  have been converted into, and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the  Effective Time, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without any  interest thereon, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in Section 3.10, of  the  certificate or certificates
that formerly evidenced such Shares (or in the  case  of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in  the  manner
provided in Section 3.10).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal  received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments  served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity  to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal  under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent  of  Parent, offer to make or make any
payment with respect to any demands for  appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 

 

SECTION  3.10. _Surrender  of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.  (a)  Prior
to  the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably  satisfactory to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying 
Agent_ ")  for  the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders
of Shares shall  become entitled pursuant to Section 3.06(a). Promptly after
the Effective Time,  Parent or Purchaser shall deposit with the Paying Agent,
for payment to the  holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III, an amount  of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the Merger  Consideration and (ii) the aggregate number of Shares issued
and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Shares
then  owned  by Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or any direct or indirect,
wholly-owned  Subsidiary of Parent, Purchaser or the Company immediately
prior to the  Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or otherwise))
(such cash amount  being referred to herein as the " _Exchange  Fund_ "). 
The  Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent;  _provided_   that no  such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders  of  Shares pursuant to this Article III. Any
interest and other income  resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and  any  amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
holders of Shares pursuant to this  Article III shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

 

 

(b) Promptly  after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five
business days  thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each person  who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive  the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
3.06(a) a form of letter of  transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk  of  loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ")  shall  pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and  instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant  to  such
letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, 
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed  in  accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be  reasonably required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such
instructions, the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor  the  Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this  Article III for each Share formerly evidenced by
such Certificate, and such  Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on  the  Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate for the  benefit of the holder of such
Certificate. Until so surrendered, outstanding  Certificates will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate  purposes, to evidence
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable  in  respect thereof
pursuant to this Article III. If the payment equal to the  Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose  name
the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Shares is registered on 
the  stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that  the  certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper  form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid  all transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger  Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the certificate  surrendered, or shall have established
to the satisfaction of Purchaser that  such taxes either have been paid or
are not applicable. If any holder of Shares  is unable to surrender such
holder's Certificates because such Certificates have  been lost, mutilated or
destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof  an  affidavit and
indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably  satisfactory
to the Paying Agent. Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving  Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from  any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares 
such amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making  of such payment under the Code or any Law. To the extent that such
amounts  are  so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares
in respect of which  such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) At  any  time following the ninth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving  Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it  any  funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to  holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income  received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it),  and,  thereafter, such holders shall be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation  (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general  creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable  upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the  foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be  liable to
any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in  respect of
such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,  escheat
or other similar Law.

 

 

(d) At  the  close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books  of  the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further  registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. From and  after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares  except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable Law.

 

 

SECTION  3.11. _Adjustments_.  Notwithstanding  any provision of this
Article III to the contrary, if between the date of this  Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall have been changed  into a
different number of Shares or a different class by reason of the  occurrence
or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, 
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination,  exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be  equitably adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision,  reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock  split), combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction.

 

 

SECTION  3.12. _Further  Assurances_.  At and  after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation shall be authorized
to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf  of the Company or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, any documents or  instruments, and to take any
other actions and do any other things, in the  name  and on behalf of the
Company or the Purchaser, reasonably necessary to vest,  perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any  and  all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties  or 
assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation  as  a result of, or in connection with, the Merger and to
otherwise accomplish  the  purpose and intent of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

governmental approvals would not have a Material  Adverse Effect. The Company
and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed  as  a foreign
corporation, limited partnership or other similar type of entity  to do 
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character 
of  the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

all Company  Stock Plans pursuant to which the Company has granted the
Company Stock Options  and Company Stock Awards that are currently

SECTION  4.04. _Authority  Relative to This Agreement_.  The  Company has
all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver  this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the 
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
and  the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and
validly  authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, and  no  other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are

the holders of a  majority of the then-outstanding Shares, if and to the
extent required by  applicable Law, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents  as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed  and  delivered by the Company and, assuming

constitutes legal, valid and binding  obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with  its terms. Prior to the execution of
this Agreement, the Board has taken all  action necessary to exempt under or

Company that would require any corporate approval other  than  that
otherwise required by the DGCL: (i) the execution of this Agreement,  (ii)
the Offer, (iii) the Merger and (iv) the other transactions contemplated 
by  this Agreement. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board has 
unanimously approved this Agreement and the Transactions and such approvals 
are  sufficient so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth
in  Section 203(a) of the DGCL shall not apply to any of the  Transactions.

 

 

SECTION  4.05. _No  Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.  (a)  The

the  Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any equivalent
organizational  documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) assuming
that all consents,  approvals and other authorizations described in Section
4.05(b) have been  obtained and that all filings and other actions described
in Section 4.05(b)  have been made or taken, conflict with or violate any
United States or  non-United States national, state, provincial, municipal or
local statute,  law,  ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order,
injunction, judgment, decree  or other order (" _Law_ ")  applicable to the
Company or any Subsidiary or by which any material property  or  material
asset of the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (iii)  result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice  or
lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give to others 
any  right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result  in  the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or
asset of the  Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture,  contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument  or  obligation to which the Company or any Subsidiary
is a party or by which the  Company or a Subsidiary or any property or asset
of the Company or any  Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, with respect
to clause (iii), for  any  such breaches, defaults or other occurrences that
would not have a Material  Adverse Effect.

(b) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the  performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any

Each Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation  plan under Section
409A of the Code has been operated since January 1, 2005  in  good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS guidance issued  with 
respect thereto. None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, 
disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee,
officer  or director of the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

 

(c) Each  Plan  is now and always has been operated in all material respects
in accordance  with  its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including, without  limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have performed  in all material respects the obligations
required to be performed by them under,  are not in any material respect in
default under or in violation of, and have  no  knowledge of any default or
violation by any party to, any Plan. No material  Action is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect  to any Plan (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and no  fact  or event
exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such  Action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each  Plan  that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section  401(k) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter  from  the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to
the Plan for which such  letters are currently available that the Plan is so
qualified and each trust  established in connection with any Plan which is
intended to be exempt from  federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code has received a  determination or opinion letter from the IRS that it
is so exempt, and no fact  or event has occurred since the date of such
letter or letters from the IRS  to  adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Plan or the exempt status  of  any such trust.

 

 

(e) Neither  the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability under,
arising out  of  or by operation of Title IV of ERISA and no fact or event
exists which could  give rise to any such liability.

 

 

(f) All  contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any  Plan  have been made on or before their due dates. All such
contributions have been  fully deducted for income tax purposes and to the
knowledge of the Company  no  such deduction has been challenged or
disallowed by any Governmental Authority  and no fact or event exists which
could give rise to any such challenge or  disallowance.

 

 

(g) In  addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Plan that is not
subject to  United States Law (a " _Non-U.S.  Benefit Plan_ "):

 

 

(i) all  employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
required  by  Law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been
made, or, if  applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting
practices, and a pro  rata contribution for the period prior to and including
the date of this  Agreement has been made or accrued;

 

 

(ii) the  fair  market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan, the liability  of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded
through insurance or the  book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan, together with any  accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the benefits  determined on any ongoing basis (actual or
contingent) accrued to the date  of  this Agreement with respect to all
current and former participants under such  Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according
to the actuarial assumptions and valuations  most  recently used to
determine employer contributions to such Non-U.S. Benefit  Plan,  and no
Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less  than
such benefit obligations; and

 

 

(iii) each  Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been
registered and has  been  maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities. Each  Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been operated in full

_REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER_

 

 

As  an  inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser  hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the

business  as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized,  existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority and
governmental  approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent
or materially  delay consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent Parent or  Purchaser from performing its obligations under this
Agreement. Purchaser was  formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement and has not engaged in any
business activities or conducted  any  operations other than in connection

corporate  action on the part of Parent and Purchaser, and no other corporate
proceedings  on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize
this Agreement  or  to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect

Purchaser in accordance with  its terms.

 

 

SECTION  5.03. _No  Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.  (a)  The 
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do not, and 
the  performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not, and
the  consummation of the Transactions by Parent and Purchaser will not, (i)
conflict  with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or
other  organizational documents of either Parent or Purchaser, (ii) assuming
that  all  consents, approvals and other authorizations described in Section
5.03(b) have  been obtained and that all filings and other actions described
in Section  5.03(b) have been made or taken, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable  to  Parent or Purchaser or by which any material property or
material asset of  either of them is affected, or (iii) result in any breach
of, or constitute  a  default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would become  a  default) under, or give to others any rights
of termination, amendment,  acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other  encumbrance on any property or asset of Parent

agreement, lease, license, permit,  franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is  a  party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any material property or material  asset  of either of them is
bound or affected, except, with respect to clause (iii),  for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences  which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay 
consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent or
Purchaser  from performing its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and  the  performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will
not, require any  consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing
with or notification  to, any Governmental Authority, except for (i)
applicable requirements, if  any,  of the Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws and
state takeover Laws, (ii) the pre-merger  notification requirements of the
HSR Act, (iii) the filing and recordation  of  appropriate merger documents
as required by the DGCL, and (iv) where the  failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to  make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,  prevent or
materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions, or  otherwise
prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing its obligations under  this 
Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  5.04. _Financing_.  Parent  has, as of the date hereof, and will

all the Transactions, including, without limitation, acquiring all  the
outstanding Shares in the Offer and the Merger.

 

 

SECTION  5.05. _Offer  Documents; Proxy Statement_.  The  Offer Documents

first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as  the  case
may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state  any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make 
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they  were made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion  in  the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment  or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at  the  time of the Stockholders' Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material  fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary in order to make

made, not false or misleading, or necessary to correct  any  statement in
any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of  proxies for
the Stockholders' Meeting which shall have become false or  misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no  representation
or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the  Company or any
of its representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing  documents or
the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents shall comply in all  material
respects as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and  the 
rules and regulations thereunder, the rules of NASDAQ and any other  Laws.

through the Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the 
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, (i) duly call, give
notice  of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as  practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose
of considering  and taking action on this Agreement and the Transactions (the

obligations, (A) include in the Proxy  Statement the recommendation of the
Board that the stockholders of the Company  adopt this Agreement and the

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser shall acquire
at least 90% of the  then outstanding Shares (including pursuant to the
Merger Option), the parties  shall take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become  effective, in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL, as promptly as reasonably  practicable after such acquisition,
without a meeting of the stockholders of  the  Company.

 

 

SECTION  7.02. _Proxy  Statement_.  If  approval of the Company's
stockholders is required by applicable Law to  consummate the Merger,
promptly following consummation of the Offer, the Company  shall, with the
assistance and approval of Parent, file the Proxy Statement  with  the SEC
under the Exchange Act, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to  have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Parent 
and Purchaser, respectively, shall each promptly furnish the Company, in 
writing, all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that may be
required  by  applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by the
Company for inclusion  in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company, Parent
and Purchaser agrees to  correct promptly any information provided by it for
use in the Proxy Statement  which shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. Parent,  Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with
each other in the preparation  of  the Proxy Statement, and the Company

to the Proxy Statement and of any requests  by  the SEC for any amendment or

representative of the Company and the SEC with respect thereto.  The Company
shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review  and
comment on the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements 
thereto, prior to such documents being filed with the SEC or disseminated to 
holders of Shares and shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity  to review and comment on all responses to requests for

SECTION  7.03. _Company  Board Representation; Section 14(f)_.  (a) 
Promptly  upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such number
of Shares  satisfying the Minimum Condition and from time to time thereafter,
Purchaser  shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors,
rounded up to  the  next whole number (but in no event more than one less
than the total number  of  directors on the Board), on the Board as shall
give Purchaser representation  on  the Board equal to the product of the
total number of directors on the Board  (giving effect to the directors
elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied  by  the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares owned by Purchaser or any  affiliate of Purchaser
following such purchase bears to the total number of  Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall, subject to compliance with  Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, at  such  time,
promptly take all actions reasonably necessary to, upon Purchaser's  request,
cause Purchaser's designees to be elected or appointed as directors of  the
Company, including increasing the size of the Board or seeking and accepting 
the resignations of incumbent directors, or both. At such times, the Company 
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause persons designated by
Purchaser  to constitute the same percentage as persons designated by
Purchaser shall  constitute of the Board of (i) each committee of the Board,
(ii) each  board of directors (or other similar body) of each Subsidiary,
and  (iii) each committee of each such board, in each case only to the
extent  permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the
Effective  Time, (A) the Board shall always have at least two (2) directors
who were  directors prior to the consummation of the Offer and who are not
affiliated  with  Parent or Purchaser (such directors, the " _Continuing 
Directors_ ");  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  if any Continuing
Director resigns from the Board or is unable to serve due  to  death or
disability or any other reason, the remaining Continuing Directors  shall be
entitled to elect or designate such resigning director's successor to  fill
the vacancy, and such director shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director 
for purposes of this Agreement and (B) the Company shall use its reasonable 
best  efforts to ensure that at least two members of each committee of the
Board  and  such boards and committees of the Subsidiaries, as of the date
hereof, who  are  not employees of the Company, shall remain members of such
committee of the  Board and of such boards and committees of the
Subsidiaries. If the number  of  Continuing Directors is reduced to fewer
than two for any reason prior to the  Effective Time, the remaining and
departing Continuing Directors shall be  entitled to designate a person to
fill the vacancy or vacancies such that there  shall be at least two
Continuing Directors, who shall thereafter be deemed  to be  a Continuing
Director for all purposes of and under this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f)  of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder to fulfill
its  obligations under this Section 7.03, and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9  such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors  as  is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill
such obligations.  Parent or Purchaser shall supply in writing to the
Company, and be solely  responsible for, any information with respect to
either of them and their  nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by such Section 14(f)  and  Rule 14f-1.

 

 

(c) Following  the date on which a majority of the Company's directors are
designees of  Purchaser (the " _Appointment  Time_ "),  prior  to the
Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement or the Certificate of 
Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, any termination of this Agreement 
by  the Company, any agreement or consent to amend this Agreement by the
Company,  any extension by the Company of the time for the performance, or
any waiver,  of  any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser, any waiver of  any  of the Company's rights, benefits or
privileges hereunder, any determination  with respect to any action to be
taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of  the  Company relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions, or any approval of  any  other action by the
Company that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the  interests of the
holders of Shares (other than Parent, Purchaser and their  affiliates) with
respect to the Transactions shall require the concurrence  of a  majority of
the Continuing Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there  shall be
only one (1) Continuing Director).

 

 

(d) Following  the Appointment Time and until the Effective Time, Parent and
Purchaser shall,  with respect to each Continuing Director, cause the Company
to maintain the  policies of the Company in effect as of the date hereof with
respect to the  cash  compensation of the Company's directors, the Company's
directors and officers' insurance and the reimbursement of travel and other
reasonable expenses relating  to or arising out of the performance of their
services as Continuing Directors  of the Company.

SECTION  7.04. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality_.  (a)  From the 
date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the 
Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of 
the  Company and the Subsidiaries to, afford the officers, employees and 
Representatives of Parent and Purchaser reasonable access at all reasonable 
times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and
other  facilities, books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary, and
shall  furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other
data  and  information (" _Company  Data_ ")  as  Parent or Purchaser,
through its officers, employees or agents, may reasonably  request (it being
agreed that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be  required to
furnish any Company Data in any format in which such Company Data  did not
exist prior to the request therefor by Parent or Purchaser); _  provided_ , 
_however_ ,  the  Company may restrict such access to the extent that (A)
any Law, applicable to  the Company or its Subsidiaries requires the Company
or its Subsidiaries to  restrict or prohibit such access, or (B) such access
would otherwise be in  breach of any confidentiality obligation in any
agreement or contract or other  obligation by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is  bound.

 

 

(b) All  information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.04  shall be kept confidential in accordance with a confidentiality
agreement,  dated  November 14, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_
"),  between Parent and the Company.

 

 

(c) No  investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall affect any
representation  or  warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the  obligations of the parties hereto or any condition to the
Offer.

 

 

SECTION  7.05. _No  Solicitation of Transactions_.  (a)  The  Company
agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary nor any of the directors,  officers
or employees of it or any Subsidiary will, and that it will not  authorize or
permit its and its Subsidiaries' agents, advisors and other  representatives
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, financial  advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any 
Subsidiary (such agents, advisors and other representatives, each, a "
_Representative_ " and  collectively, " _Representatives_ "))  to, 
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or 
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information) 
the  making, submission or announcement of any Transaction Proposal or (ii)
enter  into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with any
person or  entity with respect to or in order to obtain a Transaction
Proposal, or (iii)  agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any Transaction
Proposal or enter into  any letter of intent or other contract, agreement or
commitment contemplating  or  otherwise relating to any Transaction Proposal
(except, with respect to clause  (iii), to the extent specifically permitted
pursuant to the provisions of  Section 7.05(c)). The Company shall notify
Parent as promptly as practicable  (and in any event within one (1) business
day after the Company attains  knowledge thereof), orally and in writing, if
any Transaction Proposal, or  any  inquiry or contact with any person with
respect thereto, is made, specifying  the  material terms and conditions
thereof and the identity of the party making  such  Transaction Proposal
(including any material amendments or proposed material  amendments thereto).
The Company shall, and shall direct its Subsidiaries' directors, officers,
employees and Representatives to, immediately cease and  cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that  may  have
been conducted heretofore with respect to a Transaction Proposal. The 
Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, 
any  confidentiality agreement to which it is a party and the Company shall
promptly  request each person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement  in  connection with its consideration of making any Transaction
Proposal, if any,  to  return all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such person by  or on  behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary
and, if requested by Parent, to promptly  enforce such person's obligation to
do so.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 7.05, at any
time prior to the  Acceptance Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries'
directors, officers,  employees and their respective Representatives may take
any of the following  actions with respect to a person who, after the date of
this Agreement, has  made  a written, bona fide Transaction Proposal not
solicited in violation of Section  7.05(a) or the exclusivity agreement,
dated November 14, 2007 (the " _Exclusivity  Agreement_ "),  between Parent
and the Company (it being understood that a Transaction Proposal  made by a
person prior to the date of this Agreement without further action  by  such
person shall not be considered to be made after the date of this  Agreement),
but only if, prior to furnishing such information or entering into  such
discussions, the Board has (A) determined, in its good faith judgment  (after
having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally  recognized
reputation), that such proposal or offer constitutes, or is  reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, (B) determined, in its  good 
faith judgment after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be 
the  Company's regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that, in light
of such  Transaction Proposal, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely  to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law, (C)  provided written notice to Parent of its intent to
furnish information or enter  into discussions with such person at least 24
hours prior to taking any such  action, and (D) obtained from such person an
executed confidentiality agreement  on terms with respect to confidential
information that are no less favorable  to  the Company than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being  understood that such
confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall  not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with  such  party or
having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its  obligations
under this Agreement):

 

 

(i) furnish  nonpublic information to such third party making the Transaction
Proposal and  its employees and Representatives; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the Company shall promptly provide or make available to Parent any non-
public  information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided  to the person making the Transaction Proposal or employee or
Representative  thereof if such information was not previously provided or
made available to  Parent; and

 

 

(ii) engage  in  discussions or negotiations with such third party and its
employees and  Representatives with respect to the Transaction Proposal.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth in this Section 7.05(c), neither the Board nor any
committee thereof  shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, in any  manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the approval or
recommendation by the  Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any  other Transaction, (ii) take any action to make the
provisions of Section  203 of the DGCL inapplicable to any transaction other
than the Transactions  or  (iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit
the Company to enter into  any letter of intent, agreement or obligation with
respect to, any Transaction  Proposal (any such action listed in (i), (ii) or
(iii), a " _Change  of Recommendation_ ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Board determines, in its good faith  judgment prior to the time of
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to  the  Offer (the "
_Acceptance  Time_ ")  and  after consultation with independent legal
counsel (who may be the Company's  regularly engaged independent legal
counsel), that the failure to make such  a  Change of Recommendation would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with  its  fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law, the Board may make a Change of  Recommendation, but
only if, prior to making such Change of Recommendation,  (i)  the Board
provides written notice to Parent (a " _Notice  of Change of Recommendation_
")  advising Parent that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and
the  manner in which it intends to do so (it being understood and agreed that
the  Company shall not make any such Change of Recommendation unless (A) in
the  event  that the Company shall have previously received a Superior
Proposal, four (4)  business days shall have elapsed since Parent's receipt
of such Notice of Change  of Recommendation or (B) in the event that the
Company shall not have previously  received a Superior Proposal, three (3)
business days shall have elapsed since  Parent's receipt of such Notice of
Change of Recommendation) and (ii) if the  Board shall have previously
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the  material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, identifying the person  making such Superior
Proposal, providing to Parent copies of the definitive  forms of all
agreements pertaining to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the Board shall not make any Change of Recommendation unless (i) prior
to  making such Change of Recommendation, the Board determines, after taking
into  account any modifications to the terms of the Transactions that are
proposed  by  Parent within three (3) or four (4) business days of Parent's
receipt of the  Notice of Change of Recommendation, that a failure to make
such Change of  Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary  duties under applicable Law and (ii) if the Board shall
have previously received  a Superior Proposal, the Company simultaneously
terminates this Agreement in  accordance with Section 9.01(d)(ii) (and pays
to Parent the Fee in accordance  with Section 9.03 and enters into an
agreement with respect to a Superior  Proposal). The Company agrees that
during the three (3) or four (4) business  day  period prior to its
effecting a Change in Recommendation, the Company and its  employees,
officers, directors shall, and the Company shall direct its  Representatives
to, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its employees,  officers,
directors and Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms  of  the
Transactions that are proposed by Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

" _Transaction  Proposal_ " means  any proposal or offer (including,
without limitation, any offer or proposal  to  the Company's stockholders)
that relates to any of the following (other than the  Transactions): (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business  combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar  transaction
involving the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) any sale, lease,  exchange,
transfer or other disposition of assets or businesses that constitute  or
represent 15% or more of the total revenue, operating income, EBITDA or 
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) any
sale,  exchange, transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of any class of
equity  securities of the Company or of any Subsidiary; or (iv) any tender
offer or  exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person
beneficially  owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or of any  Subsidiary.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

" _Superior  Proposal_ " means  an unsolicited written bona fide offer,
which did not result from a breach  of  Section 7.05, made by a third party
to consummate any Transaction Proposal  (i)  that the Board determines, in
its good faith judgment (after having received  the  advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation), to be (A)  more favorable to
the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than  the Offer and
Merger and (B) reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms  so 
proposed, taking into account all relevant financial, regulatory, legal and 
other aspects of such proposal, including any conditions, and (ii) for which 
financing, to the extent required, is then committed; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the
references to "15%" in the definition of Transaction Proposal shall be deemed
to be references  to "50%".

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 7.05 shall prohibit the Board from taking and
disclosing to  the  Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or  Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, if the Board  determines, in its good faith judgment after
consultation with independent  legal  counsel (who may be the Company's
regularly engaged independent legal counsel),  that failure to so disclose
such position would constitute a violation of  applicable Law; _provided_  
that any  Change of Recommendation shall be governed by the terms of this
Agreement,  including Section 7.05(c).

 

 

SECTION  7.06. _Employee  Benefits Matters_.  From  and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation  and  its
subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts, 
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and 
the  Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that
are  applicable to any current or former employees, consultants, or directors
of  the  Company or any Subsidiary. Following the Effective Time, Parent
shall give  each  Company employee credit for prior service with the Company
or its Subsidiaries,  including predecessor employers, for purposes of (i)
eligibility and  vesting under any employee benefit plan of Parent or its
applicable subsidiary  in which such employee becomes eligible to participate
at or following the  Effective Time, and (ii) determination of benefits
levels under any  vacation or severance plan of Parent or its subsidiaries in
which such employee  becomes eligible to participate at or following the
Effective Time; provided  that in each case under clauses (i) and (ii) above,
if the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries maintains a comparable Plan,
service shall be credited  solely to the extent that such crediting will not
result in the duplication  of  benefits. Parent shall give credit under
those of its and its subsidiaries' welfare benefit plans in which Company
employees and their eligible dependents  become eligible to participate at or
following the Effective Time, for all  co-payments made, amounts credited
toward deductibles and out-of-pocket  maximums, and time accrued against
applicable waiting periods, by Company  employees and their eligible
dependents, in respect of the plan year in which  the Effective Time occurs
or the plan year in which such individuals are  transitioned to such plans
from the corresponding Plans, and Parent shall waive  all requirements for
evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions  otherwise applicable,
except as would also be applicable under the corresponding  Plans, to Company
employees and their eligible dependents under the employee  heath plans of
Parent and its subsidiaries, including medical, dental, vision  and
prescription drug plans, in which such individuals become eligible to 
participate at or following the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION  7.07. _Directors '  and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_. 
(a)  From and  after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will maintain  in  effect in all respects the current
obligations of the Company pursuant to any  indemnification agreements
between the Company and its directors, officers  and  employees (the
"Indemnified Parties") in effect immediately prior to the  Effective Time and
any indemnification provisions under the Certificate of  Incorporation and
By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate  of  Incorporation
and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions  with
respect to exculpation and indemnification that are no less favorable  to 
the Indemnified Parties than are set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation  and By-Laws of the Company, in each case as in effect on the
date hereof, which  provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period  of  six years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely  the  rights thereunder of the Indemnified
Parties, unless such modification shall  be  required by applicable Law and
then only to the minimum extent required by  applicable Law.

(b) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for
six years from  the Effective Time, if available, the current directors' and
officers' liability  insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided
that the Surviving  Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage  containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable) with respect to  matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend pursuant to  this  Section 7.07(b) more
than an amount per year equal to 250% of the current annual  premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance (which premiums the Company  represents and
warrants to be $905,063 in the aggregate); _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that,  if the annual premiums for such insurance exceed such amount or in the
event  of  an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current
policies, the  Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as much
coverage as is  possible under substantially similar policies for such
maximum annual amount  in  aggregate annual premiums; _provided_ , 
_further_   that  Parent and the Surviving Corporation may satisfy its
obligations under this  Section 7.07(b) by obtaining, at the Effective Time,
prepaid (or "tail")  directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, in
each case, the material  terms of which, including coverage, amount and
creditworthiness of the issuer,  are no less favorable to such directors and
officers than the insurance coverage  otherwise required under this Section
7.07(b). In such event, Parent and the  Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect  and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all  other obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first  sentence of this
Section 7.07(b) for such six-year period; _provided_   that in  no event
shall the Surviving Corporation pay a premium for such "tail" policy  that in
the aggregate exceeds $2,000,000 (it being understood that the Surviving 
Corporation may nevertheless acquire a "tail" policy providing such coverage
as  may be obtained for such $2,000,000 amount). In the event that Parent
or  Purchaser shall not have purchased any such "tail" policy from an
insurance  provider of national reputation that is not affiliated with Parent
at least  3  business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
entitled to  purchase, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, such "tail"
policy,  _provided_   that in  no event shall the Company pay a premium for
such "tail" policy that in the  aggregate exceeds $2,000,000.

 

 

(c) In  the  event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
respective successors  or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not  be  the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets  to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made  so  that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as  the  case may be, or,
with respect to the Surviving Corporation, at Parent's option,  Parent, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section  7.07.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of  the  Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.07.

 

 

(e) This  Section 7.07 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable  by,  the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall  be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their successors and  assigns.

 

 

SECTION  7.08. _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  (a) The  Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice  to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the 
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be expected to
cause  any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or  inaccurate, ___provided_ _that_ ,  solely  in the case of the
Company, such notice shall be required to be given only  if as  a result of
the matters to be described in such notice the condition set forth  in clause
(e) of Annex A would not be satisfied and, solely in the case of  Purchaser
and Parent, such notice shall be required to be given only if the  matters to
be described in such notice would prevent or materially delay  Purchaser or
Parent from consummating any of the Transactions; _provided_ _further_   that
any  such notice by the Company shall not be deemed to have qualified or
modified  the  representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement for  the purposes of determining whether the conditions
specified in Annex A have  been satisfied and (ii) any failure of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser, as  the  case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied  with or satisfied by it
hereunder, _  provided_ _that_ ,  solely  in the case of the Company, such
notice shall be required to be given only  if as  a result of the matters to
be described in such notice the condition set forth  in clause (f) of Annex A
would not be satisfied and, solely in the case of  Purchaser and Parent, such
notice shall be required to be given only if the  matters to be described in
such notice would prevent or materially delay  Purchaser or Parent from
consummating any of the Transactions, and (iii) the  occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence,  which would
cause the condition set forth in clause (d) of Annex A to not be  satisfied;
_  provided_ , _  however_ ,  that  the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 7.08 shall not limit or  otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such  notice.

 



 

(b) Each  party to this agreement shall promptly notify the other party of
any  communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental  Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and  permit the other party a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance any  proposed substantive communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority.  Neither party to this Agreement shall agree to
participate in any meeting with  any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation (including  any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it  consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such  Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the reasonable opportunity to  attend at such meeting.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties  to  this Agreement
will coordinate and cooperate reasonably with each other in  exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party  may 
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early 
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. 
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will 
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications  between them or any of their representatives, on the one
hand, and any  Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect  to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

the  terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties  hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and
thereafter make  any  other required submissions, under the HSR Act or other
applicable foreign,  federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade
Laws with respect to  the  Transactions and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken,  all appropriate action, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary,  proper or advisable under applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective  the  Transactions, including, without
limitation, using its reasonable best efforts  to obtain all Permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications  and  orders of
Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company  and  the
Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Transactions  and 
to fulfill the conditions to the Offer and the Merger. In case, at any time 
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry  out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors
of each  party to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take all  such  action. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement  to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Purchaser be
obligated to, and  the  Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree with
any Governmental Authority  without the prior written consent of Parent, to
divest or hold separate, or  enter into any licensing or similar arrangement
with respect to, all or any  portion of the business or assets (whether
tangible or intangible) of the  Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries
that is material to either Parent  and its subsidiaries or the Company and
the Subsidiaries, in each case, taken  as  a whole.

 



 

(b) Each  of  the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts  to  vigorously contest and resist any Action, including
administrative or judicial  Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree,  judgment, injunction or other order (whether
temporary, preliminary or  permanent) that is in effect and that restricts,
prevents or prohibits  consummation of the Transactions, including, without
limitation, by vigorously  pursuing all available avenues of administrative
and judicial  appeal.

 

 

SECTION  7.10. _Public  Announcements_.  Parent  and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release  or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or  any  Transaction
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public  statement
prior to such consultation, except as to any statement permitted  by 
Section 7.05(c) and as may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of 
any  United States or non-United States securities exchange. The parties have
agreed  upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Offer and the
execution  of  this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  7.11. _Section  16 Matters_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required  and permitted to cause

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,  to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  7.12. _State  Takeover Statute_.  The  Company and the Board
shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that  no  state takeover Law
or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,  the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions contemplated by this  Agreement and
(b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable  to  this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that 
the  Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  may  be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this  Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement,  the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  7.13. _Rights  Agreement_.  The  Board shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, amend, take any  action with respect to, or
make any determination under, the Rights Agreement  prior to the termination
of this Agreement unless such action is taken in  connection with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section  9.01(d)(ii). Prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section  9.01, the Company shall
not amend, and the Board shall not take any action  to  amend, the Rights
Plan such that clauses (a) and (b) of Section 4.17 of this  Agreement become
untrue.

 

 

SECTION  7.14. _Fairness  Opinion_.  The  Company shall make available to

practicable after the Company receives a written copy  of  the Fairness
Opinion from Goldman, Sachs and Co.

any affiliate of either of them illegal  or  otherwise restricting,
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the  Transactions; and

Purchaser (or Parent  on  Purchaser's behalf) having accepted for payment
any Shares pursuant to the Offer  on or before March 15, 2008 (the "

Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not  be  available to any party

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective  Time to occur on or
before such date; or (ii) any Governmental Authority  shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction,  order, decree or
ruling which is then in effect and has the effect of making  consummation of

ruling is final and nonappealable; or

 

 

(c) By  Parent, if

 

 

(i) in  the  event (A) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part

cured by the Company within  45  calendar days following receipt of written
notice from Parent of such breach  or  inaccuracy (it being understood that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(i)
if such breach or inaccuracy by the  Company is cured within such period); 
or

 

 

(ii) prior  to  the Acceptance Time, the Board or any committee thereof

to do so; or

the failure of such condition  within such period); or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) By  the  Company, if

 

 

(i) in  the  event (A) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part
of Parent or  Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or (B) that any
representation or  warranty of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall have been  inaccurate when made or shall have become
inaccurate, but only to the extent  that such breach or inaccuracy (i) would
prevent or materially delay the ability  of Parent or Purchaser to consummate
the Transactions and (ii) is not cured  by  Parent or Purchaser, as the case
may be, within 45 calendar days following  receipt of written notice from the
Company of such breach or inaccuracy (it  being understood that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant  to  this Section 9.01(d)(i) if
such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Purchaser  is cured within such
period); or 

 

 

(ii) it  makes  a Change of Recommendation in order to enter into an
agreement for a Superior  Proposal; _provided_   that  it has  theretofore
complied with Section 7.05(c).

 

 

SECTION  9.02. _Effect  of Termination_.  In the  event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this  Agreement shall forthwith
become void, and there shall be no liability on the  part of any party
hereto, except (a) as set forth in Section 9.03 and  (b) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any  intentional and material breach
hereof prior to the date of such termination;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,

50

complied, in all  material respects, with their respective obligations under
this Agreement; 

 

 

(iv) following  the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of  this Agreement, a third party shall make a Transaction
Proposal and shall not  have withdrawn such Transaction Proposal; and

together with interest on the amounts  set forth in this Section 9.03 at the

be amended by the parties hereto by action  taken by or on behalf of their
boards of directors or Supervisory Board, as  the  case may be, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  after the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders  of  the
Company, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or change 
the  type of consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon
consummation  of the Merger. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in  writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable  of  being enforced by any rule
of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and  provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect  so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected  in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that  any 
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, 
the  parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so

SECTION  10.03. _Entire  Agreement; Assignment_.  This  Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to  the 
subject matter hereof and supersedes, except as set forth in Section
7.04(b),  all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties,  or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall  not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation
of Law or  otherwise), except that Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any
of their  rights and obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Parent,
provided that  no  such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder  if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

 

 

SECTION  10.04. _Parties  in Interest_.  Except  as expressly provided for
in Section 7.07, this Agreement shall be binding  upon  and inure solely to
the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this  Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other  person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason  of this
Agreement. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its  successor
or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and  shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such 
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its 
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper
provision  shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the

_ANNEX  A_

 

 

_Conditions  to the Offer_

 

 

Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to  accept for  payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
and may extend,  terminate or  amend the Offer, if (i) immediately prior to
the expiration of the  Offer, the  Minimum Condition shall not have been
satisfied, (ii) any applicable  waiting  period under the HSR Act or the
Foreign Antitrust Laws set forth on  Schedule A  of the Disclosure Letter
shall not have expired or been terminated  prior to the  expiration of the
Offer or (iii) at any time on or after the date of this  Agreement and prior
to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following  conditions shall exist
and be continuing:

 

 

(a) there  shall have been instituted or be pending any Action by any
Governmental  Authority (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal,
materially delay,  or  otherwise, directly or indirectly, restrain or
prohibit or make materially  more  costly, the making of the Offer, the
acceptance for payment of any  Shares by  Parent, Purchaser or any other
affiliate of Parent, the purchase of  Shares  pursuant to the Merger Option
or the consummation of any other Transaction,  or  seeking to obtain
material damages in connection with any Transaction;  (ii)  seeking to
prohibit or limit materially the ownership or operation  by the  Company,
Parent or any of their subsidiaries of all or any of the business  or 
assets of the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries or to compel 
the  Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries, as a result of the
Transactions,  to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or
similar  arrangement  with respect to, all or any portion of the business or
assets (whether  tangible  or intangible) of the Company, Parent or any of
their subsidiaries  that is  material to either Parent and its subsidiaries
or the Company and the  Subsidiaries, in each case, taken as a whole; (iii)
seeking to impose  or confirm  any limitation on the ability of Parent,
Purchaser or any other affiliate  of  Parent to exercise effectively full
rights of ownership of any Shares,  including, without limitation, the right
to vote any Shares acquired  by  Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger Option or otherwise on  all matters  properly presented to the
Company's stockholders, including, without limitation,  the adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions; (iv) seeking to  require  divestiture by
Parent, Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent of  any Shares;  or (v)
which otherwise would have a Material Adverse Effect;

 

 

(b) any  Governmental Authority or court of competent jurisdiction shall
have  issued an  order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other
action permanently  restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
materially delaying  or  preventing the Transactions and such order, decree,
injunction, ruling  or other  action shall have become final and non-
appealable;

 

 

(c) there  shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation or
interpretation  enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to
(A) Parent,  the  Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or the
Company or  (B) any  Transaction, by any United States or non-United States
legislative  body or  Governmental Authority with appropriate jurisdiction,
other than the  routine  application of the waiting period provisions of the
HSR Act or Foreign  Antitrust  Laws to the Offer or the Merger, that is
reasonably likely to result  in any of  the consequences referred to in
clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph  (a)  above;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-1  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) any  Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the date of this 
Agreement;

 

 

(e) (i)  the  representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section  4.03(a) shall  not be true and correct (except for inaccuracies
regarding the number  of Shares,  Company Stock Options or Company Stock
Awards that in the aggregate  are less  than 0.5% of the outstanding Shares
on a Fully Diluted Basis as of  the date of  this Agreement) or (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company  contained in Section 4.14
shall not be true and correct in all material  respects  (without giving
effect to any qualifications or limitations as to materiality  or  Material
Adverse Effect set forth therein) or (iii) the representations  and 
warranties of the Company contained in any other Section of the Agreement 
shall  not be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications 
or  limitations as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth 
therein), in  each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), as of the date of the
Agreement  and as of the  date of determination as though made on the date
of determination (except  to the  extent that such representation or
warranty expressly relates to a  specified  date, in which case as of such
specified date), except, in the case  of clause  (ii), where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be  true and  correct in all material
respects as of such dates is not material to  the  business of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted,  taken as a  whole, and in the
case of clause (iii), where the failure of such  representations and
warranties to be true and correct as of such dates,  has not  had a Material
Adverse Effect;

 

 

(f) the  Company shall have failed to perform, in any material respect, any 
obligation or  to comply, in any material respect, with any agreement or
covenant  of the  Company to be performed or complied with by it under
this  Agreement;

 

 

(g) this  Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;  or

 

 

(h) the  Company shall not have furnished Parent immediately prior to the
expiration  of  the Offer with a certificate signed on the Company's behalf
by its Chief  Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer attesting to the
conditions  set  forth in items (e) and (f) of this Annex A,

 

 

and  which, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of Purchaser in any 
such case,  and regardless of the circumstances (including any action or
inaction  by Parent  or any of its affiliates) giving rise to any such
condition, makes  it  inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for
payment.

 

 

The  foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent 
and may be  asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving  rise to  any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Parent
in whole  or in part  at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion. The failure  by  Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights  shall  not be deemed a waiver of any such right;
the waiver of any such right  with  respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed  a waiver  with respect to any other facts
and circumstances; and each such right  shall be  deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time  to  time.
