 (b) SellerÂ’s Right to Dispute. If the Seller delivers written notice (the "Disputed Items Notice") to the Buyer within 30 days after receipt by the Seller of the Cash Purchase Price Certificate (i) stating that the Seller objects to any items in the Cash Purchase Price Certificate and (ii) providing reasonably detailed descriptions of the basis for each objection (the "Disputed Items"), the Buyer and the Seller will attempt to resolve and finally determine and agree upon the Disputed Items as promptly as practicable. If the Seller does not deliver the Disputed Items Notice to the Buyer within 30 days after receipt by the Seller of the Cash Purchase Price Certificate, the Cash Purchase Price specified in the Cash Purchase Price Certificate will be presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will be final and binding on the parties. In addition, any component of the Cash Purchase Price Certificate that is not addressed in the Disputed Items Notice shall be final and binding on the Seller and the Buyer. 

   

 (c) Arbitration of Disputes. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree upon the Disputed Items within 30 days after delivery of the Disputed Items Notice, the Buyer and 

     ##### 

  

    

the Seller will select PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm is
unwilling to serve, an independent, nationally-recognized accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to each of them (in either case, the "Independent
Accounting Firm") to resolve the Disputed Items. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall (i) address only the Disputed Items set forth in the
Disputed Items Notice and may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value claimed for such item by either party or smaller than the smallest
value claimed for such item by either party, and (ii) re-calculate the
Cash Purchase Price, as modified only by the Independent Accounting FirmÂ’s
resolution of the Disputed Items. The Buyer and the Seller will each have the
same opportunity to present its position and submit materials regarding the
Disputed Items to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firm will make a written determination of each Disputed Item within 30 days
after being selected and such determination will be final and binding on the
parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will
be borne by the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such
determination, or if the Independent Accounting Firm determines that neither
party could be fairly found to be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs
and expenses will be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer. 

   

 (d) Payment. At such time as the Disputed Items are finally resolved and the Cash Purchase Price is finally determined, either (i) the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of the final Cash Purchase Price over the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, or (ii) the Seller shall cause to be paid to the Buyer an aggregate amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price over the final Cash Purchase Price. 

   

 (e) Access to Information. The Seller and its accountants, lawyers and representatives will be given full access at all reasonable times to (and shall be allowed to make copies of) the books and records of the Buyer and the Company and to any personnel of the Buyer and the Company reasonably requested by such Persons, in each case in connection with the determination of the Cash Purchase Price or any dispute relating thereto. The rights of the Seller under this Agreement shall not be prejudiced by the failure of the Buyer or the Company to comply with this Section. 

   

 (f) BuyerÂ’s Failure to Deliver Cash Purchase Price Certificate. If, for any reason, the Buyer fails to deliver the Cash Purchase Price Certificate within the time period required by Section 1.5(a), the Seller may give written notice of such failure to the Buyer (the "Section 1.5 Notice"). If the Buyer fails to deliver the Cash Purchase Price Certificate to the Seller within seven (7) days after receipt of the Section 1.5 Notice, the Estimated Cash Purchase Price Certificate shall be considered for all purposes of this Agreement as being the "Cash Purchase Price Certificate" delivered by the Buyer pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and the Cash Purchase Price specified therein will be presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will be final and binding on the parties (subject to the SellerÂ’s right to dispute the Cash Purchase Price Certificate as set forth in Section 1.5(b)). 

   

 1.6. Earnout Payment. If earned in accordance with the Earnout Agreement, the Buyer shall make the additional payment to the Seller described in the Earnout Agreement (the "Earnout Payment"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.7. Withholding. The Buyer and the Company will deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement (including payments of Consideration and Sale Bonuses and releases of any portions of the Escrow Fund) such amounts as the Buyer or the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made.

   ##### 

  

 

its terms, the Company or the Seller, as applicable, shall disclose to the
Buyer in writing (in the form of updates to the applicable Schedules
delivered on the date hereof (each such update, a "Disclosure Supplement"))
any information, event, matter, action or omission hereafter arising
or discovered which (i) if existing or known on the date of this Agreement,
would be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement in order to make
the CompanyÂ’s or the SellerÂ’s representations and warranties contained herein
true and not misleading, or (ii) causes or constitutes a breach of any such
representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE III,
respectively, or a breach of any covenant hereunder by the Company or the
Seller or would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE III, respectively, if again made at or
subsequent to the time the Disclosure Supplement in question is delivered to
the Buyer. No information contained in any Disclosure Supplement shall be
deemed to amend and/or supplement the Schedules delivered on the date hereof
for any purpose hereunder (including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 have been satisfied and/or for
purposes of Article VII), nor shall the information contained in or the
delivery of any Disclosure Supplement affect any of the BuyerÂ’s rights or
remedies under ARTICLE VII hereof, which rights and remedies shall be
determined on the basis of the Schedules delivered on the date hereof. 

   

 5.7. Tax Matters. 

  

 (a) Consistent Tax Reporting. The Buyer shall file a consolidated federal Income Tax Return that includes the Company for the taxable period of the Company starting with the day next following the Closing Date. Accordingly, the taxable year of the Company will close for federal Income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date. No election under Section 338 of the Code (relating to stock purchases treated as asset acquisitions) or under Treasury Regulation Section Â§1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation elections) shall be made. The Company shall not engage in any transactions on the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business other than the Transactions. The parties agree that any deductions accrued by the Company as of the Closing Date, including with respect to payments to employees of the Company on the Closing Date (including the Sales Bonuses), are properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date prior to the Closing, and accordingly the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) is not applicable to such deductions. 

   

 (b) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) all Tax Returns of the Company due (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date ("Seller Prepared Tax Returns") and the Seller shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Taxable Periods") that are due after the Closing Date ("Buyer Prepared Tax Returns"). The Buyer shall permit the Seller to review and comment on each Buyer Prepared Tax Return with respect to which the Seller is required to pay a Tax shown as due on such Tax Return or which Tax Return shows a refund that will give rise to a payment to the Seller under Section 5.7(d)(iii) at least 10 days prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Seller. The Company shall not amend any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax 

   ##### 

  

   

Period (other than as a result of claiming a Tax refund pursuant to Section
5.7(d)(iii)) without the written consent of the Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. All Tax Returns to be prepared by or for the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past procedures, practices, and accounting methods of the Company, except
as otherwise required by Legal Requirements. The Seller shall be responsible
for all Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods including
Taxes resulting from any Contest, and shall pay to (or as directed by) the
Company any Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods except
to the extent that such Taxes are taken into account in the final
determination of Closing Working Capital. If the Seller is obligated to pay
any Tax of the Company, the Seller shall pay such Tax as directed no later
than five business days prior to the due date for paying such Tax to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The Company shall retain McGladrey and Pullen
LLP to prepare the IRS Form 1120 for the Company for the year ended on the
Closing Date and all state and local income Tax Returns for such period, each
and all of which shall be prepared within 180 days following the Closing
Date. 

   

 (c) Tax Periods That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods that include but do not end on the Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return to the extent the Seller is obligated to pay a Tax shown as due on such Tax Return at least 10 days prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Seller. The Seller shall be responsible for Taxes that relate to such Taxable periods as determined under this Section 5.7(b) (including Taxes resulting from any Contest) except to the extent such Taxes are taken into account in the final determination of Closing Working Capital. If the Seller is obligated to pay any Tax of the Company, the Seller shall pay such Tax as directed no later than five business days prior to the due date for paying such Tax to the applicable Governmental Authority. For purposes of this Section 5.7(b), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the pre-Closing period shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated on a basis consistent with the allocations made pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Seller shall not be required to pay any Taxes pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) to the extent that such Taxes are taken into account in the final determination of Closing Working Capital. 

   

 (d) Cooperation on Tax Matters. 

    

 (i) The Buyer, the Company and the Seller shall cooperate fully, to the extent reasonably requested by another, in connection with the preparing and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Sections 5.7(b) and 5.7(b) or otherwise, complying with any information reporting requirements under the Code or other Legal Requirements, and in any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall 

   ##### 

  

    

include the retention and (upon the other partyÂ’s request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return
preparation or filing, information reporting requirements, audit, litigation,
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. 

   

 (ii) If requested by the Buyer, the Company and the Seller will cooperate with the Buyer to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed upon the Company (including, but not limited to, with respect to the Transactions). 

   

 (iii) All Tax refunds (other than any refund (A) to the extent attributable to deductions that were taken into account in the final determination of Closing Working Capital to reduce the Tax liability of the Company, or (B) resulting from the carrying back or the other use of any net operating loss, Tax credit, or other Tax attribute for any period beginning after the Closing Date (or portion of any period beginning after the Closing Date) (whether in the form of cash received or a direct credit against Taxes otherwise payable for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date) relating to Taxable periods or any portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, whether received in cash or applied to a subsequent Taxable period, shall be solely for the benefit of the Seller, and the Buyer shall cause the same to be paid within 10 days of receipt to the Seller (without interest other than interest received from the Governmental Authority), net of any Taxes and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates, incur (or will incur) with respect to such Tax refund (and related interest). To the extent a refund that gave rise to a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed, or otherwise reduced or lost, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of Taxes that the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates incurs as a result of such disallowance, reduction, or loss (and any related interest or penalties and other Losses). To the extent the Company incurs a net operating loss (or other Tax attribute) for U.S. federal income Tax purposes for the year ended on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not waive such net operating loss and shall, to the extent allowed by applicable Legal Requirements, carry back such net operating loss and shall timely claim any refunds for Taxes as a result of such carrybacks, including through amending Tax Returns. All refunds claimed by the carry back of net operating losses shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, be claimed in cash. Nothing in this Section 5.7(d)(iii) shall require a payment with respect to any Tax refund that would also give rise to a payment obligation by the Company to a third party (including a former shareholder) under the 2008 Purchase Agreement. 

  

 (e) Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, the Company shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company (each, a "Contest"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Seller shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its own expense to the extent it relates to Taxable periods or any portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the Buyer shall not allow the Company to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that could affect the 

   ##### 

  

   

Tax liability of the Company for any Taxable period or portion thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date without the written consent of the Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. 

   

 (f) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer when due, and the Company will, at the BuyerÂ’s expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp, registration, and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Buyer and the Seller will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. 

   

 (g) Tax Treatment of Certain Payments. Unless required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that is final, the parties hereto agree, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, to file all Tax Returns (and to cause their respective Affiliates to file all Tax Returns) consistently with, and not take any position during the course of any Tax audit or other legal proceedings with respect to Taxes (or allow their respective Affiliates during the course of any audit or other legal proceeding with respect to Taxes) that is inconsistent with this Section 5.7 and the following treatment: (i) that, as provided in Section 7.8 of this Agreement, all indemnification payments under this Agreement constitute adjustments to the purchase price, (ii) that all interest and other earnings on the Escrow Fund are income of the Buyer, and (iii) that all Earnout Payments are treated as purchase price, except to the extent required to be treated as interest under Code section 483 or any other provision of the Code or state, local, or foreign law. 

   

 (h) Termination of Agreements. All Tax sharing, Tax allocation, or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither Holdings nor Opco shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

   

 (i) Survival. The obligations of the Seller to pay any Taxes (and related Losses) under this Section 5.7, and the obligation of the Buyer, the Company, or any of their Affiliates to make payments under Section 5.7(d)(iii), shall survive until the Cut-Off Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the Buyer, the Company, and their Affiliates to make any payments with respect to Income Tax refunds requested by a filing made on or before the Cut-Off Date shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statue of limitation with respect to such refund. 

   

 5.8. DirectorsÂ’ and OfficersÂ’ Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (each, a "Proceeding"), in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Closing, a director or officer of the Company (the "Indemnified Persons") is, or is threatened to be, made a party or witness thereto based in whole or in part on the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director or officer of the Company, and arising out of or relating to acts or omissions by such Indemnified Person in his capacity as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to 

      ##### 

  

    

the Closing, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law and the
Company Charter Documents, indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified
Person from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the
fullest extent permitted by law and the Company Charter Documents, provided
that the Indemnified Person to whom attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses are advanced
or for which fees and expenses of counsel are paid provides an undertaking to
repay such advances and payments if it is ultimately determined by
a determination of a Governmental Authority that is final that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with or arising out of such
Proceeding. 

   

 (b) An Indemnified Person shall notify the Company of the existence of a Proceeding for which such Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder as promptly as reasonably practicable after such Indemnified Person learns of such Proceeding; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company under this Section 5.8 except to the extent such failure to notify actually prejudices the Company. The Indemnified Person and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense of any Proceeding. No settlement of a Proceeding may be made by the Company without the Indemnified PersonÂ’s consent, except for a settlement which requires no more than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Person is fully indemnified and which does not require the admission of liability. 

   

 (c) The Seller shall cause the Company to purchase a so-called "tail" for the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance, covering Persons who are currently covered by such insurance on terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof for a period of at least six years after the Closing, with the cost of such policy to be paid by the Buyer;  _provided_ , that to the extent the premium payable by the Buyer or the Company in respect of such "tail" policy exceeds $50,000, any such excess shall be reimbursed by the Seller promptly following receipt from the Buyer of such documentation as Seller may reasonable request relating to such excess. 

   

 (d) In the event the Company shall be obligated hereunder to provide indemnification for or make any advances with respect to the fees and expenses of any Proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain one counsel of such Indemnified PersonÂ’s own choice to represent such Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer; and such counsel shall, to the extent consistent with its professional responsibilities, reasonably cooperate with the Company and any counsel designated by the Company. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and such Indemnified PersonÂ’s estate, heirs and representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification rights that any Indemnified Person or such Indemnified PersonÂ’s estate, heirs and representatives may have under the Company Charter Documents, any Legal Requirement, any contract or otherwise. 

   

 (f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5.8 shall continue in full force and effect for a period commencing as of the Closing and ending as of the later of 

      ##### 

  

    

(i) the six year anniversary of the Closing and (ii) the date that all
applicable statute of limitation periods have expired for any claim or claims
for which an Indemnified Person may be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 5.8; _provided_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any claim for indemnification under this Section 5.8 asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. 

   

 5.9. Books and Records. The Company shall deliver to the Buyer all of the minute books, stock ledgers and similar corporate records and corporate seals (if any) of the Company at or promptly following the Closing. Until the five year anniversary of the Closing, the Seller and its accountants, lawyers and representatives shall be entitled, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to have access to and to make copies of the books and records and other information of the Company for any purpose relating to the SellerÂ’s ownership of the Company prior to the Closing, including the preparation of Tax Returns. In the event of any litigation or threatened litigation between the parties relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, the covenants contained in this Section 5.9 shall not be considered a waiver by any party of any right to assert the attorney-client privilege or any similar privilege. 

  

 5.10. Employee Matters. From and after the Closing, the Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against all Losses that any of them may suffer by reason of or in connection with any Proceeding brought against any of them under the WARN Act, or any similar Legal Requirement, which relate to actions taken by the Buyer at, or at any time after, the Closing (including any discharge or constructive discharge of any the employees of the Company with regard to any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the Company). 

  

 5.11. Termination of Certain Agreements. At or prior to the Closing, the Company and the Seller shall take such action as may be necessary to cause the agreements described in _Schedule 5.11(a)_ to be terminated and for the parties thereto to release and waive any and all claims that any of them may have under such agreements. 

  

 5.12. Financial Information. Within 21 days following the end of each calendar month beginning with the calendar month of August 2010 until the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a true and correct copy of the unaudited balance sheet and statements of income and cash flows of the Company as of and for the calendar month then ended prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (provided that such financial statements may omit footnotes and shall be subject to normal year-end adjustments). In addition, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer, at the same time it makes such information available to the SellerÂ’s principal owner, such daily, weekly or other periodic "dashboard" reports, including periodic reporting as to sales and case volumes, as are susceptible of preparation and dissemination by the Company without undue effort or expense (it being understood and agreed by the Buyer that neither the Company nor the Seller makes any representation or warranty with respect to any such information or reports as may be delivered to the Buyer pursuant to this sentence). 

  

 5.13. Section 280G Vote. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G(c)) a waiver of all payments or other benefits that were disclosed on _Schedule 2.18_ or that the Company is obligated to pay or provide that would not be deductible under Code Section 280G or would be subject to an excise 

   ##### 

  

 

Tax under Code Section 4999, such that after giving effect to all waivers, the
Company has not made or provided, and is not required to make or provide, any
payments or benefits that would not be deductible under Code Section 280G or
would be subject to an excise Tax under Code section 4999 (the payments and
benefits waived shall be collectively referred to as the "Section 280G
Waived Payments"). Prior to the Closing Date, and after receiving all waivers
provided for in the prior sentence, the Company shall submit, accompanied by
adequate disclosure, for shareholder approval all Section 280G Waived
Payments, and all other payments and benefits which absent
shareholder approval could be deemed "parachute payments" under Code Section
280G(b), in a manner such that if more than 75% of the Company voting
shareholders approve the payments such approval shall satisfy the
requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(D) (and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder) and all payments or other benefits provided by the
Company to any "disqualified individual" will not be nondeductible under Code
Section 280G or subject to an excise Tax under Code section 4999. All costs
and expenses of obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote under this
Section 5.13 shall be treated as SellerÂ’s Expenses and shall be paid by the
Sellers.

 SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in the certificates delivered at the Closing pursuant to Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(c) shall survive the Closing (regardless of any investigation made by any party or on its behalf, the knowledge of any such partyÂ’s officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, employees, agents, attorneys and their representatives, or the acceptance of any certificate) until the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Cut-Off Date"). No claim for breach of any representation, warranty, pre-Closing covenant or pre-Closing agreement may be brought after the Cut-Off Date, except for any claim (a) of which the Seller has been notified in writing with reasonable specificity by the Buyer prior to the Cut-Off Date or (b) of which the Buyer has been notified in writing with reasonable specificity by the Seller prior to the Cut-Off Date. The post-Closing covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive in accordance with their respective terms. 

  

 7.2. Indemnification of the Buyer. Subject to the other terms of this ARTICLE VII, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and hold the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company following the Closing) and their respective officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, employees, agents, attorneys and their representatives (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from all Losses incurred by them that arise or result from: (a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Seller and the Company contained in ARTICLE II or the certificates delivered at the Closing by the Seller and the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(d), (b) any breach of the representations and warranties of the Seller contained in ARTICLE III or the certificate delivered at the Closing by the Seller pursuant to Section 6.1(d), (c) the failure of the Seller to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, or (d) the failure of the Company to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein that are required to be performed prior to the Closing. The BuyerÂ’s right to make claims under this Section, however, shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions: 

   

 (i) The Seller shall not have any liability pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) unless, and only to the extent that, the cumulative amount of Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds $1,800,000, and then only to the extent of such excess;  _provided_ , that this Section 7.2(i) shall not apply to a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.1 (Â‘ _Organization, Power and Standing_ Â’), Section 2.2 (Â‘ _Subsidiaries Â’_), Section 2.3 (Â‘ _Foreign Qualifications_ Â’), Section 2.4 (Â‘ _Due Authorization_ Â’), Section 2.6 (Â‘ _Validity and Enforceability_ Â’), Section 2.7 (Â‘ _Capitalization Â’_), Section 2.18 (Â‘ _Taxes Â’_), Section 2.24 (Â‘ _Affiliate Transactions_ Â’), Section 2.25 (Â‘ _Brokers Â’_), Section 3.1 (Â‘ _Title Â’_), Section 3.2 (Â‘ _Authority Â’_), Section 3.4 (Â‘ _Enforceability Â’_) or Section 3.5 (Â‘ _Taxes Â’_) and Losses associated with the breach of any such representation or warranty shall not be included in the determination of whether the $1,800,000 threshold has been exceeded. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source of payment for any and all claims for indemnification under this Section 7.2 and, accordingly, the aggregate liability of the Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses under this Section 7.2 shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount at any time remaining in the Escrow Fund. 

   

 (iii) None of the Buyer, the Company or the Seller may assign their rights in the Escrow Fund or any interest therein without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Seller. 

   

 (iv) No claim shall be made with respect to Losses that have been reflected as a deduction in determining the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5 (for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that no adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.5 shall be considered a breach of any representation, warranty or other provision of this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and no claim shall be made in respect thereof). 

   

 (v) For purposes of calculating Losses (but not for purposes of determining whether any particular representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has been breached), any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be ignored. 

  

 7.3. Indemnification of the Seller. Subject to the other terms of this ARTICLE VII, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, employees, agents, attorneys and their representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties" and, together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless from all Losses incurred by them which arise or result from (a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered at the Closing by the Buyer pursuant to Section 6.2(c), (b) the failure of the Buyer to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth herein, or (c) the failure of the Company to perform any covenant or agreement set forth herein which by its terms is to be performed after the Closing. The SellerÂ’s right to make claims under this Section, however, shall be subject to the following limitations and conditions: 

   

 (i) The Buyer shall not have any liability pursuant to Section 7.3(a) unless, and only to the extent that, the cumulative amount of Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds $1,800,000, and then only to the extent of such excess. 

   

 (ii) Except for (A) its obligation to pay the Cash Purchase Price, (B) its obligation to make the Earnout Payment, if any, and (C) its and the CompanyÂ’s other obligations in respect of covenants and agreements to be performed after the Closing, the BuyerÂ’s aggregate liability pursuant to Section 7.3 shall be limited in the aggregate to $12,000,000. 

  

 7.4. Procedure for Indemnification. 

  

 (a) Any party hereto entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of the claim in writing upon learning of such claim or the facts constituting such claim, describing the claim in reasonable detail, the amount thereof (if known), and the basis therefor. The indemnifying party will be relieved of its indemnification 

      ##### 

  

    

obligations hereunder if and only to the extent that it is materially
prejudiced by the indemnified partyÂ’s failure to give such prompt notice. The
party from whom indemnification is sought shall respond in writing to each
such claim within 30 days of receipt of such notice (the "Response Period").
No action shall be taken pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or otherwise by the party seeking indemnification (unless reasonably
necessary to protect the rights of the party seeking indemnification) until
the expiration of the 30-day response period. Unless the indemnifying party
gives the Indemnified Party written notice that it agrees to
take responsibility for such a claim within the Response Period, then such
claim shall be deemed to be contested, and such contested claim shall be
resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by the Buyer
and the Seller (a copy of which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent)
or (ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 60 days
following the end of the Response Period by binding litigation between the
Buyer and the Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If a claim for indemnification hereunder is based on a claim by a third party, the indemnifying party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (a "Defense Notice") within the Response Period, to assume the entire control of the defense thereof including, at its own expense, employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any Proceeding with counsel of its choice at its expense. In such event, the indemnifying party shall have the right to settle or resolve any such claim by a third party; _provided_ , that any such settlement or resolution contemplated by the Seller (as the indemnifying party) shall not be concluded without the prior written approval of the Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and, _provided further_ , that any such settlement or resolution contemplated by the Buyer, as the indemnifying party, shall not be concluded without the prior written approval of the Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

   

 (c) If the indemnifying party shall fail to give a Defense Notice, it shall be deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject third party claim, and in such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct such defense in good faith. If the Indemnified Party defends the subject third party claim, the indemnifying party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the fees and expenses incurred in defending such third party claims upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party elects to conduct the defense of the subject third party claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such third party claim; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation necessary; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any third party claim. 

   

 (d) The party claiming indemnification shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and make available to the indemnifying party all reasonably requested information under its control, all at the expense of the indemnifying party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will, and as reasonably requested by the Seller will cause employees of the Company to, cooperate fully with the Seller in connection with any matter for which the Seller is the indemnifying party, all at the expense of the indemnifying party. 

     ##### 

  

     

 7.5. Determination of Losses. 

  

 (a) As used herein, "Losses" means all claims, damages, penalties, fines, Taxes, obligations, losses, judgments, expenses, costs, liabilities and fees, including court costs and reasonable attorneysÂ’ and accountantsÂ’ fees and expenses, but excluding punitive damages (other than punitive damages owed to third parties). In determining the amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds (after giving effect to any applicable deductible or retention) and other third party recoveries (other than Tax benefits covered in Section 7.5(b)) actually received (which amount shall be net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) by the Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, the Company) in respect of such Losses (which proceeds and recoveries the Indemnified Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain). If an indemnification payment is received by an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, the Company) later receives insurance proceeds or other third party recoveries (other than Tax benefits covered in Section 7.5(b)) in respect of the related Losses, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party a sum equal to the lesser of (a) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds and other third party recoveries or (b) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid with respect to such Losses. 

   

 (b) In determining the amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any Tax benefit that the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates actually realizes as a result of the event giving rise to indemnification. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the realization of such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the indemnifying party, within 30 days of the filing of the Tax Return on which such Tax benefit is actually realized (or, if the Tax benefit is in the form of a refund or reduction in Tax, within 10 days of receiving the refund from the Governmental Authority or such reduction), the amount of such Tax benefit. For purposes of this Section 7.5(b), a Tax benefit shall equal the actual reduction in Income Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates on their Tax Returns for the Tax year of and the Tax year following the event giving rise to indemnification and shall be computed by comparing the Income Taxes the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates paid for such Tax years with the amount of Income Taxes the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates would have paid for the same if the event giving rise to indemnification had not occurred and the indemnification payments were not made. 

   

 7.6. Subrogation. If (a) the Buyer receives an indemnification payment hereunder, and (b) the Buyer and/or the Company has a claim against a third party (including any insurer) in respect of the related Losses, the Seller shall be subrogated to the rights and claims of the Buyer and/or the Company, as the case may be, against such third party. The Seller shall not, however, have the right to collect aggregate payments from such third party or third parties in excess of the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid with respect to such Losses. The Buyer and the Company will execute and deliver to the Seller such documents and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the Seller in order to give effect to this Section. 

  

 7.7. Remedies Exclusive. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth 

   ##### 

  

 

herein. The remedies provided in this ARTICLE VII and under Section 9.5 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
Seller Indemnified Parties and their successors and permitted assigns after
the Closing with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, including
any breach or non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein. No Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party shall bring any claim with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, other than (a) a claim
of fraud, (b) an indemnification claim made by Buyer on behalf of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 7.2, (c) an
indemnification claim made by the Seller on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Parties in accordance with Section 7.3, or (d) a claim in accordance with
Section 9.5. In addition, the Buyer hereby waives the equitable remedy
of rescission. The provisions of this ARTICLE VII constitute an integral part
of the consideration given to the Seller pursuant to this Agreement and were
specifically bargained for and reflected in the total amount of the
Consideration payable to the Seller in connection with the Transaction. 

   

 7.8. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the maximum extent permitted by law, it is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price for all purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly. Consistent with the foregoing, the parties agree that no indemnification to be provided or payments to be made under this Article VII shall be calculated or determined on an after-Tax basis. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION 

   

 8.1. Termination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

 (a) by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer; 

   

 (b) by the Buyer, if (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Seller and the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct to the extent set forth in Section 6.1(a), or the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 6.1(c), or any of the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct to the extent set forth in Section 6.1(b), or the Seller shall have breached or failed to perform any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 6.1(c), and (ii) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured within 30 days after the Buyer gives the Company and the Seller written notice identifying in reasonably detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation; 

   

 (c) by the Seller, if (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct to the extent set forth in Section 6.2(a), or if the Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 6.2(b), and (ii) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured within 30 days after the Seller gives the Buyer written notice identifying in reasonable detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation; 

       ##### 

  

     

 (d) by either the Seller or the Buyer, if any court or Governmental Authority has issued a final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; or 

   

 (e) by either the Seller or the Buyer, if the Closing has not occurred by October 31, 2010 or such other date, if any, as the Company and the Buyer may agree in writing; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose willful and knowing failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has contributed to the failure of the Transactions to occur on or before such date. 

   

 8.2. Effect of Termination. 

  

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated as provided above, the parties shall have no further obligations hereunder (including for costs and expenses incurred by other parties in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions), except as provided below and except that each party shall be liable for its willful and knowing breach of this Agreement and the other parties hereto shall be entitled to all rights and remedies provided by law in respect of such breach. 

   

 (b) The obligations of the Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives under Section 5.1(b) shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 9.2. No Waiver. No failure of any party to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder. 

  

 9.3. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may be modified, amended or waived at any time only by a writing signed by the Buyer and the Seller, and any such modification, amendment or waiver shall be binding on each of the parties hereto, including the Company. 

  

 9.4. Choice of Law; Forum; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Any proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the courts located in
the State of Delaware. This provision may be filed with any court as written
evidence of the knowing and voluntary irrevocable agreement between the
parties to waive any objections to jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience
of forum. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. 

   

 9.5. Specific Performance. In addition to any and all other remedies that may be available at law in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Seller and the Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of the agreements and obligations of the parties hereunder and to such other injunctive or other equitable relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 9.6. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company and the Seller and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void, except that the Buyer may assign its rights (a) to one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of the Buyer (including any subsidiaries which may be organized subsequent to the date hereof), (b) in connection with a sale of capital stock, a sale of assets, a merger or another disposition involving the Buyer or the Company or (c) to any lender providing financing to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for collateral security purposes, and any such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of the Buyer hereunder; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 9.7. Integration; Schedules. 

  

 (a) This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes all prior discussions, understandings and agreements concerning the matters covered hereby, except as set forth in Section 5.1(b). The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the sale of the Purchased Securities exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and the parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Information set forth on any Schedule hereto shall be deemed to qualify each Section of this Agreement to which such information is applicable (regardless of whether or not such Section is qualified by reference to a Schedule), so long as application to such Section is 

      ##### 

  

    

reasonably discernible from the reading of such disclosure. No information set
forth on any Schedule hereto shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope
of the CompanyÂ’s representations and warranties. The inclusion of an item on
any Schedule hereto is not evidence of the materiality of such item for
purposes of this Agreement or otherwise, or that such item is a
disclosure required under the Agreement. No disclosure in any Schedule hereto
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, Authorization
or Legal Requirement shall be construed as an admission or indication that
any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred, or
shall constitute an admission of liability to any third party. 

   

 9.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and with counterpart signature pages, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement, binding on all of the parties hereto notwithstanding that all such parties have not signed the same counterpart. Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing an original signature. 

  

 9.9. Expenses. All legal and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any Proceeding instituted by a party hereto arising in whole or in part under, related to, based on, or in connection with, this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the losing party reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including any appeals therefrom. 

  

 9.10. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Indemnified Persons referenced in Section 5.8 of this Agreement are intended third party beneficiaries of the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties in such Section. The Buyer Indemnified Parties referenced in Section 7.2 of this Agreement and the Seller Indemnified Parties referenced in Section 7.3 of this Agreement are intended third party beneficiaries of the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, respectively. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as giving any third party any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 

  

 9.11. Publicity. No party shall issue a press release or make any other public announcement concerning the Transactions without the prior written consent of the Company, the Seller and the Buyer, except to the extent required by Legal Requirement, in which case the other parties hereto shall have the opportunity to review and comment prior to disclosure. 

  

 9.12. Construction of Agreement. 

  

 (a) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein. 

   

 (c) Headings. The headings of Articles and Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof. 

   

 (d) Currency. Unless otherwise specified herein, any references to "dollars", "$" or other dollar amounts in this Agreement shall mean the lawful currency of United States. 

   

 (e) Business Days. Any reference to a "business day" shall mean any day except Saturday, Sunday, any statutory holiday in the State of Delaware or any other day on which the principal chartered banks in the State of Delaware are closed for business. 

   

 (f) Calculation of Days. When calculating the period of time within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date which is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-business day, the period in question shall end on the next business day. 

   

 (g) Pronouns. All words and personal pronouns shall be read and construed as the number and gender of the party or parties referred to in each case require and the verb shall be construed as agreeing with the required word and pronoun. 

   

 (h) Legal Requirements and Documents. Unless otherwise specified, (i) any references herein to any Legal Requirement shall be construed as a reference thereto as in effect from time to time, and (ii) any reference to this Agreement or any other document is a reference to this Agreement or such other document as amended, restated and supplemented from time to time and includes all schedules and exhibits thereto. 

   

 (i) References to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereto", "hereunder", "hereby" and other similar expressions refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or portion of it. 

   

 (j) Including. Where the word "including" or the word "includes" is used in this Agreement, it means "including (or includes) without limitation". 

   

 9.13. Waiver of Conflicts. The Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Seller shall have the right to retain the Designated Firms to represent its interests in any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, any agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or the Transactions (a "Dispute"); (b) the Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) irrevocably waives, consents to and covenants not to assert any objection, based on conflict of interest or otherwise, to any representation of the Seller by the Designated Firms in any Dispute; (c) all communications 

   ##### 

  

 

between the Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, on the one hand,
and the Designated Firms, on the other hand, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise relating
to any potential sale of the Company (the "Protected Seller Communications"),
shall be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications; and (d) all
rights to such Protected Seller Communications, and the control of the
confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, shall be retained by the
Seller. As used herein, "Designated Firms" means Choate, Hall and Stewart LLP,
Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. and Kelley Drye and Warren LLP.
