losses, judgments, expenses, costs, liabilities and fees, including court costs and reasonable
attorneys&#146; and accountants&#146; fees and expenses, but excluding punitive damages (other than punitive
damages owed to third parties). In determining the amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified
Party is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses
shall be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds (after giving
effect to any applicable deductible or retention) and other third party recoveries (other than Tax
benefits covered in Section&nbsp;7.5(b)) actually received (which amount shall be net of the expenses of
the recovery thereof) by the Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, the

assert a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any such Losses shall be determined
after deducting therefrom the amount of any Tax benefit that the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates actually realizes as a result of the event giving rise to indemnification. If
indemnification payments shall have been received prior to the realization of such Tax benefit, the
Indemnified Party shall remit to the indemnifying party, within 30&nbsp;days of the filing of the Tax
Return on which such Tax benefit is actually realized (or, if the Tax benefit is in the form of a
refund or reduction in Tax, within 10&nbsp;days of receiving the refund from the Governmental Authority
or such reduction), the amount of such Tax benefit. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;7.5(b), a Tax
benefit shall equal the actual reduction in Income Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates on their Tax Returns for the Tax year of and the Tax year following the event giving
rise to indemnification and shall be computed by comparing the Income Taxes the Indemnified Party

Buyer and/or the Company has a claim against a third party (including any insurer) in respect of
the related Losses, the Seller shall be subrogated to the rights and claims of the Buyer and/or the
Company, as the case may be, against such third party. The Seller shall not, however, have the
right to collect aggregate payments from such third party or third parties in excess of the actual
amount of the indemnification payment previously paid with respect to such Losses. The Buyer and
the Company will execute and deliver to the Seller such documents and take such other actions as
may reasonably be requested by the Seller in order to give effect to this Section.
