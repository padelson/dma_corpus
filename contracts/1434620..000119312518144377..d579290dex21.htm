Consideration by the Restricted Share Number. 

(v) Each Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall, as of the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into a right to receive (A) an MVW
deferred stock unit award on the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award under the applicable ILG Equity Plan and
award agreement in effect immediately prior to the ILG Merger Effective Time,
with respect to a number of shares of MVW Common Stock, rounded up or down
to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock subject to such Holdco Deferred Stock Unit Award
immediately prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time (the " _DSU
Share Number_ ") by the Exchange Ratio and (B) except as set forth on Section
2.1(d) of the _ILG Disclosure Letter_ , an award of cash (which shall be
subject to the same vesting conditions applicable to such Holdco Deferred
Stock Unit Award under the applicable ILG Equity Plan and award agreement in
effect immediately prior to the ILG Merger Effective Time) in an amount
determined by multiplying the Cash Merger Consideration by the DSU Share

of ILG or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing

file such other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of MVW
Common Stock necessary to fulfill MVWs obligations under this _Section_ __ _
2.1(d)_. MVW shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of MVW Common Stock for delivery with respect
to the Holdco Equity Awards assumed by it in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 2.1(d)_.

 

(vii) With respect to any amount payable under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)
_that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code, to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause
the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under this
Agreement and the terms of the corresponding award that occurs on or after the
applicable distribution date specified above and that will not result in the
imposition of such Tax or penalty.

 

(e) _Conversion of Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation Common Stock_. As of
the Final Holdco Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Final Holdco Merger

outstanding immediately prior to the Final Holdco Merger Effective Time shall

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, MVW
shall designate a bank, trust company or nationally recognized stockholder
services provider, which shall be acceptable to ILG (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the purpose of exchanging, in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. MVW shall
deliver to the Exchange Agent, as needed, (i) cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)(i)_ and (ii) Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing a
sufficient number of shares of MVW Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock
Merger Consideration (including the Excess Shares to be sold by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) in respect of the shares of Holdco
Common Stock. MVW shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

 



9 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, and MVW shall cause
the Exchange Agent to, mail to (i) each holder of record of a certificate that
immediately prior to the ILG Merger Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of ILG Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the ILG Merger Consideration (a " _Certificate_ "), and (ii) each
holder of uncertificated shares of ILG Common Stock represented by book entry
that were converted into the right to receive the ILG Merger Consideration ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), which, in each case, by virtue of the Initial Holdco
Merger, was subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as MVW and the Exchange Agent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by MVW, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by MVW or the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and any
Certificate and Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of
or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
registration or payment that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such registration or payment of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such
registration in the name of or payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Delivery of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Until surrendered or cancelled as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender or cancellation the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender or cancellation of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to MVW Common Stock with a record date after the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or uncancelled Book-Entry Share with respect to any
shares of MVW Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.2(e)_, in each case until the surrender or cancellation of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this  _Article II_.
Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender or cancellation
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be

 



10  paid to the holder of shares of MVW Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or cancellation,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of MVW Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of MVW Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender or
cancellation and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or cancellation
payable with respect to such shares of MVW Common Stock.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in ILG Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange or cancellation
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Holdco Common Stock (and any rights to receive shares of Holdco Common Stock
as a result of the ILG Merger) theretofore represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of MVW to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
ILG on such shares of ILG Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of (i) the Initial ILG Surviving Corporation of the shares of ILG Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the ILG Merger Effective Time
and (ii) the Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation of the shares of Holdco
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time. If, after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to MVW or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article II_ , except as otherwise provided by Applicable Law.

 

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates representing fractional shares of MVW Common Stock shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange or cancellation of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of MVW.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of ILG Common Stock converted pursuant to the ILG Merger into the
right to receive the ILG Merger Consideration, which was thereafter converted
pursuant to the Initial Holdco Merger into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (other than with respect to ILG Equity Awards and Holdco Equity
Awards described in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_), who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of MVW Common Stock (after taking
into account all Certificates delivered by such holder and Book-Entry Shares
held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to such fraction as determined below. As promptly as
practicable following the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of MVW
Common Stock

 



11  represented by the aggregate Stock Merger Consideration (without giving
effect to the preceding paragraph (i)) over (ii) the aggregate number of full
shares of MVW Common Stock to actually be distributed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (after giving effect to the preceding
paragraph (i)) (such excess being herein referred to as the " _Excess Shares_
"). As soon as practicable after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on NYSE, all in
the manner provided herein.

 

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the
net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds
in trust for such holders. The net proceeds of any such sale or sales of
Excess Shares to be distributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be reduced by any and all commissions, transfer Taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs, as well as any expenses, of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon
as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be
paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
amounts to such holders subject to and in accordance with this _Section_ _
2.2(e)_.

 

(f) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _2.2(a)_ that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one year after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time shall be delivered
to MVW, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be
entitled to look only to MVW for payment of their claim for any shares of MVW
Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of MVW Common Stock and
any dividends or distributions with respect to MVW Common Stock.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the parties hereto or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered or cancelled prior to seven years after the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash,
any shares of MVW Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
MVW Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions with respect to MVW
Common Stock in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or other distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of MVW, free and clear of all claims or interests of
any person previously entitled thereto.

 



12 (h) _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
aggregate Cash Merger Consideration delivered by MVW pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.2(a)(i)_ and any proceeds from the sale of Excess Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ as directed by MVW; _provided_ that no losses on such
investments shall affect the cash payable to former holders of shares of ILG
Common Stock or Holdco Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
MVW.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the parties hereto and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to
or deposited with the proper Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. As of the date
hereof, none of the parties to this Agreement has knowledge of any such
withholding obligation (other than with respect to compensatory payments).

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by MVW or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as MVW or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of MVW Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and other
distributions on shares of MVW Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

(k) _Exchange of Shares in the ILG Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, there shall be no exchange of certificates or book entry
shares in the ILG Merger and, in lieu thereof, the holders of certificates or
book entry shares of ILG that were converted into the right to receive shares
of Holdco Common Stock in the ILG Merger shall participate with respect to
such shares of Holdco Common Stock solely in the exchange procedures provided
above in this _Section_ __ _2.2_ with respect to the Merger Consideration to
be received pursuant to the Initial Holdco Merger. 

(l) _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
shares of Holdco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead at the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time shall become entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and at
the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time all

 



13  Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, then (i) such shares of Holdco Common Stock shall thereupon
cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur
following the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share
shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as
of the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. ILG shall deliver prompt notice
to MVW of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Holdco Common Stock and
ILG shall provide MVW with the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Except as required by Applicable Law, ILG shall not settle, make any
payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to the
Appraisal Shares without the prior written consent of MVW.

Section 2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement and
the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of ILG
Common Stock or MVW Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, dividend payable in stock or other securities or other
similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio and related provisions shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of ILG Common Stock and MVW
Common Stock or ILG Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange, dividend or other similar transaction; _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, that (i) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall
be construed to permit ILG or MVW to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement and (ii) cash
dividends, share repurchases and grants of equity compensation in each case
consistent with the terms hereof shall not result in any adjustment to the
Exchange Ratio.

 

Section 2.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, the officers and directors or managers, as applicable, of MVW
and the Initial Holdco Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Company,
as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of ILG, Holdco, the Final Surviving Company or MVW, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf thereof, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in MVW, any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by MVW as a result of, or in connection with, the Combination
Transactions.

disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by ILG to MVW prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the " _ILG Disclosure Letter_ ") and making
reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is

obligations of ILG or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or

the date of such amendment), the ILG SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
" _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to the ILG SEC
Documents, and none of the ILG SEC Documents when filed (or, if amended, as
of the date of such amendment) and at their respective effective times, if
applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which

(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of ILG and its consolidated subsidiaries as of

the ILG Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2017 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with
or contemplated by this Agreement, neither ILG nor any of its subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on or
reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of ILG and its subsidiaries
(or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ILG.

 

(iv) ILG maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ILGs
properties or assets. Since January 1, 2016, ILG has disclosed to its auditors
and the audit committee of ILGs Board of Directors any written notification
of any (1) "significant deficiency" in the internal control over financial
reporting of ILG, (2) "material weakness" in the internal control over
financial reporting of ILG or (3) fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of ILG who have a significant role in
the internal controls over financial reporting of ILG. ILG has made available
to MVW all such disclosures made by ILG since January 1, 2016 to its auditors
or the audit committee of ILGs Board of Directors to the date of this
Agreement.

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by ILG are designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by ILG in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information
required to be disclosed is accumulated and

 



19  communicated to the management of ILG, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of ILG to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(vi) Neither ILG nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among ILG and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, ILG or any of its
subsidiaries in ILGs or such subsidiarys published financial statements or
other ILG SEC Documents.

 

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by ILG specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to ILGs stockholders or at
the time of the ILG Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
ILG with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based
on or derived from information supplied by MVW specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(i) From December 31, 2017 through the date of this Agreement, the businesses
of ILG and its subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in
the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice,
except for the execution and performance of this Agreement and the
discussions, negotiations, actions and transactions related hereto.

exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities
that are required for the operation of the businesses of ILG and its
subsidiaries (the " _ILG Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any
such ILG Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ILG. ILG and its subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the ILG Permits and all applicable laws
(including common law), statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies
or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any
Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ ") and Data Security
Requirements relating to ILG and its subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with
such ILG Permits, Applicable Laws and Data Security Requirements, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on ILG. No action, demand, requirement or investigation by any
Governmental Entity and no suit, action, investigation or proceeding by any
person, in each case with respect to ILG or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties, is pending or, to the knowledge of ILG,
threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome of which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on ILG.

or misrepresentation, or to selling real estate investments, timeshares,

respective properties or assets or any of their respective officers or
directors (in their capacity as such) before any court or arbitrator or any
Governmental Entity, and (ii) there is no settlement or similar agreement that
imposes any ongoing obligation or restriction on ILG or any of its

Service has

 



21  determined that each ILG Benefit Plan that is intended to be a qualified
plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and ILG is not aware of
any event occurring after the date of such determination that would adversely
affect such determination, except for any such events that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on ILG. No condition exists that is reasonably likely to
subject ILG or any ERISA Affiliate of ILG to any direct or indirect liability
under Title IV of ERISA or to a civil penalty under Section 502(i) or 502(l)
of ERISA or liability under Section 4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976,
4980H, 4980D or 4980B of the Code or other liability with respect to the ILG
Benefit Plans, in each case that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ILG. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of ILG, threatened, claims (other than routine
claims for benefits or immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or against any of
the ILG Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto except where such claims
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on ILG.

Entity based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to
the employment of, or termination of employment by, ILG of any person.

ILG have in all material respects performed all obligations required to be
performed by them to date under each ILG Material Contract, except where such
noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be

violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of ILG, does there exist any
condition that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
result in such a violation or default under), or any intent to terminate or
not renew, any ILG Material Contract. To the knowledge of ILG, no other party

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on ILG.

the MVW Filed SEC Documents, (B) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2017 and (C) for liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with
or contemplated by this Agreement, neither MVW nor any of its subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on or
reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of MVW and its subsidiaries
(or in the notes thereto) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW.

(iv) MVW maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
MVWs properties or assets. Since January 1, 2016, MVW has disclosed to its
auditors and the audit committee of MVWs Board of Directors any written
notification of any (1) "significant deficiency" in the internal control over
financial reporting of MVW, (2) "material weakness" in the internal control
over financial reporting of MVW or (3) fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of MVW who have a significant role in
the internal controls over financial reporting of MVW. MVW has made available
to ILG all such disclosures made by MVW since January 1, 2016 to its auditors
or the audit committee of MVWs Board of Directors to the date of this
Agreement.

(v) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by MVW are designed to ensure

disclosed by MVW in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed,

 



37 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is
accumulated and communicated to the management of MVW, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of MVW to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(vi) Neither MVW nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among MVW and any of
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, MVW or any of its
subsidiaries in MVWs or such subsidiarys published financial statements or
other MVW SEC Documents.

 

(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied

Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to MVWs stockholders or at
the time of the MVW Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
MVW with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based
on or derived from information supplied by ILG specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(i) From December 31, 2017 through the date of this Agreement, the businesses
of MVW and its subsidiaries have been conducted in all material respects in
the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past practice,
except for the execution and performance of this Agreement and the

such MVW Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. MVW and its subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the MVW Permits, Applicable Laws and Data
Security Requirements relating to MVW and its subsidiaries or their
respective businesses or properties, except where the failure to be in
compliance with such MVW Permits, Applicable Laws and Data Security

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. No action, demand,
requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action,
investigation or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to MVW or
any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, is pending or,

39 any event occurring after the date of such determination that would adversely
affect such determination, except for any such events that would not,

Benefit Plans, in each case that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of MVW, threatened, claims (other than routine
claims for benefits or immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or against any of
the MVW Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto except where such claims
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on MVW.

of MVW is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force and effect, and MVW
and each subsidiary of MVW have in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by them to date under each MVW Material
Contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate,

(w)  _MVW Financing_.

(i) MVW has delivered to ILG a true, complete and correct copy of each of (A)
a fully executed debt commitment letter and (B) the fully executed fee letter
referenced in such commitment letter ( _provided_ that the fee amounts,
economic market flex provisions and other economic terms may be redacted from
such fee letter so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of the
financing contemplated by such commitment letter) (such commitment letter,
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and joinders thereto, as the same
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended or replaced from time to time
in compliance with _Section 5.14_ is referred to herein as the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), among Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger
Sub and the MVW Debt Financing Sources party thereto, pursuant to which, among
other things, the MVW Debt Financing Sources have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, to provide or cause to
be provided, on a several and not joint basis, the financing commitments
described therein.

 



47 (ii) The Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date of this Agreement, in
full force and effect. The Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date of this
Agreement, the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each of
Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of
MVW, the other parties thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Applicable Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the
date of this Agreement, (x) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended,
modified, supplemented, extended or replaced, (y) no such amendment or
modification is anticipated by MVW or any subsidiary thereof (other than to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement) and (z) the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and,
other than as specifically contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, to the
knowledge of MVW, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission
is contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) neither Volt Corporate
Merger Sub or Volt LLC Merger Sub nor, to the knowledge of MVW, any other
counterparty thereto, is in breach of any of its covenants or other
obligations set forth in, or is in default under, the Debt Commitment Letter
and (ii) to the knowledge of MVW, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (A)
constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of Volt Corporate
Merger Sub or Volt LLC Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of MVW, any Volt Debt
Financing Source) under the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) constitute or result
in a failure to satisfy a condition or other contingency set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter on the part of Volt Corporate Merger Sub or Volt LLC
Merger Sub (or, to the knowledge of MVW, any MVW Debt Financing Source), or
(C) otherwise result in the funds contemplated to be available under the Debt
Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, which are sufficient for MVW, Volt
Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger Sub, together with available cash and
cash equivalents, to fund the Cash Merger Consideration, and any other
cash amounts payable by MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger
Sub at the Closing in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Combination Transactions, and to pay all
related fees and expenses of MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC
Merger Sub required to be paid at the Closing in connection therewith (the "
_MVW Required Amount_ "), to not be available to MVW, Volt Corporate Merger
Sub or Volt LLC Merger Sub (and in any event prior to the Closing Date). As
of the date of this Agreement, neither MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub nor Volt
LLC Merger Sub has received any notice or other communication from any party
to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to (i) any actual or potential
breach or default on the part of MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub or Volt LLC
Merger Sub or any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter, or (ii) any
intention of such party to terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or to not
provide all or any portion of the Debt Commitment Letter in an amount
necessary, together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, to
finance the MVW Required Amount. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Commitment Letter other than as expressly set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the
funding of the MVW Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or
expressly contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (none of which (i)

 



48 reduces the amount of the MVW Debt Financing below the MVW Required Amount or
(ii) contains provisions that impose any additional conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the MVW Debt Financing or otherwise adversely
amends, modifies or expands any condition precedent to the funding of the MVW
Debt Financing). As of the date of this Agreement, MVW has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment
Letter that are payable on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms
of the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter will be sufficient for MVW, together
with available cash and cash equivalents, to fund the MVW Required Amount
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date.

 

(x) _Timeshare and Exchange Matters_.

 

(i) Each MVW Offering Document is in full force and effect and, to the extent
applicable, is valid and binding on MVW (or, to the extent a subsidiary of
MVW is a party, such subsidiary), and MVW and each subsidiary of MVW have in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by
them to date under each MVW Offering Document, except where
such noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. Neither MVW nor any of its
subsidiaries has knowledge of, or has received written notice of, any
violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of MVW, does there exist
any condition that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would result in such a violation or default under) any MVW Offering Document
that would result in a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. To the knowledge of
MVW, no other party to any MVW Offering Document is in breach of or default
under the terms of any MVW Offering Document where such default has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on MVW. Except as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW, MVW
and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all Vacation
Ownership Interests of MVW and its subsidiaries of MVW not yet sold (subject
to any pending sales contracts and Permitted Liens).

 

(ii) The registration and public offering statements and MVW Offering
Documents filed with Governmental Entities in connection with the offering,
marketing and sale of Vacation Ownership Interests and Exchange Program
memberships by MVW or any of its subsidiaries complied at the time of filing
in all respects with Applicable Laws, including registration and
disclosure requirements and regulations applicable to timeshare and exchange
offerings made under the laws of all states and other jurisdictions in which
the offering, marketing and sale of Vacation Ownership Interests and Exchange
Program memberships are conducted, except where the failure to be in
compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW. All
marketing and sales of Vacation Ownership Interests or Exchange Program
memberships by MVW and its subsidiaries have been made in compliance with
Applicable Laws or applicable exemptions, except where the failure to be in
compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW.

 



49 (iii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MVW, (A) with respect to
each of the Vacation Ownership Interests financed by MVW or any of its
subsidiaries and each of the promissory notes and other receivables held or
financed by any relevant development entity in which MVW or any of its
subsidiaries owns interests as of December 31, 2017 through the date of this
Agreement (the " _MVW Vacation Ownership Receivables_ "), equitable title of
each such MVW Vacation Ownership Receivable is owned by MVW or any of its
subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and
legal title is in the name of MVW or any of its subsidiaries, an affiliate of
MVW or any of its subsidiaries as nominee thereof or in the name of Mortgage
Electronic Registration System, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as nominee
thereof (each, a " _MVW Vacation Ownership Lender_ ") and (B) such MVW
Vacation Ownership Lender has full right and authority to enforce all
documents and instruments evidencing or securing such MVW Vacation Ownership
Receivable, subject to Permitted Liens and except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Applicable Laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity.

 

(iv) None of MVW nor any of its subsidiaries has taken or intends to take, or
has been notified that any third party has taken or intends to take, any
current action to deflag, or has the current right to exercise any right of
deflagging of, and there are no unresolved deflaggings with respect to, any
Vacation Ownership Property or Co-located Facility of MVW or any of its
subsidiaries, nor has MVW or any of its subsidiaries been notified that any of
the resorts that are the subject of the MVW Brand Agreement are in violation
of the standards thereunder or otherwise not in compliance with the standards
set forth in the MVW Brand Agreement.

58 Section 4.2 _No Solicitation by ILG_.

 

(a) Each of ILG and Holdco shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its
controlled affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees
to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (a "
_Representative_ ") retained by it or any of its controlled affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal
the consummation of which by any person would constitute an ILG Alternative
Transaction or (ii) enter into, participate in or continue any discussions or
negotiations with any person (except to notify such person of the existence of
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_), with respect to any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
by any person would constitute an ILG Alternative Transaction (and ILG shall
cause any previously granted physical or electronic data room access provided
to any such person to be immediately terminated); _provided_ that if, at any
time prior to obtaining the ILG Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of ILG determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal
that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_ constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to an ILG Superior Proposal, subject to
compliance with  _Section 4.2(c)_, ILG and its Representatives may (A)
furnish information with respect to ILG and its subsidiaries to the person
making such proposal (and its Representatives and financing sources) (
_provided_ that any such information that is nonpublic has previously been
provided to MVW or is provided to MVW prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality and non-use
generally no less restrictive than the terms of the confidentiality agreement,
dated January 24, 2017, entered into between ILG and MVW (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, any such
confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill
restrictions or otherwise restrict the making, amending or modifying of a
proposal regarding an ILG Alternative Transaction) and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of this Agreement, " _ILG
Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than MVW
and its subsidiaries (including Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger
Sub) (an " _ILG Third Party_ "), acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the outstanding shares of
ILG Common Stock or Holdco Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing 25% or more of the voting power of ILG or
Holdco, including pursuant to a stock purchase, merger, consolidation, tender
offer, share exchange or similar transaction involving ILG, Holdco or any
of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) any transaction pursuant to which any
ILG Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries
of ILG or Holdco and any entity surviving any merger or combination including
any of them) of ILG, Holdco or any of their respective subsidiaries
representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
ILG (or, following the ILG Merger, Holdco) and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (iii) any disposition of assets representing 25% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of ILG (or, following the ILG
Merger, Holdco) and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

 



59 (b) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_, neither ILG, the
Board of Directors of ILG nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
withhold, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to MVW, the approval or recommendation
by such Board of Directors or such committee of the ILG Merger, the Initial
Holdco Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any ILG Alternative Transaction (any action
in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as an " _ILG Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) cause or permit ILG, Holdco or any of their
respective controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating
to any ILG Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that prior to obtaining the ILG Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of ILG determines in good faith, after it has received a proposal
for an ILG Alternative Transaction and determined that such transaction
constitutes an ILG Superior Proposal (and after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of ILG may (subject to this and
the following sentences) (A) effect an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change or
(B) terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such ILG Superior Proposal (subject to the satisfaction of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_), but in the case of each of
clauses (A) and (B), only (i) at a time that is after (x) the fifth business
day following MVWs receipt of written notice from ILG advising MVW that
the Board of Directors of ILG has received an ILG Superior Proposal
specifying the material terms and conditions of such ILG Superior Proposal
(and including copies in the form provided to ILG of the ILG Superior Proposal
and the then-current proposed draft definitive agreements relating to the ILG
Superior Proposal and financing documents), identifying the person making such
ILG Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make an ILG Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement and (y) ILG has negotiated
in good faith with MVW during such five business day period (to the extent MVW
desires to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by MVW in response to
the ILG Superior Proposal and (ii) if after such five business day period and
following the Board of Directors of ILG having taken into account all changes
(if any) to the terms of this Agreement proposed by MVW and any
other information provided by MVW in response to such notice, the Board of
Directors of ILG shall have determined in good faith that (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) such ILG Superior Proposal would continue to constitute an ILG
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that in the event of a material subsequent
modification to the terms and conditions of such ILG Superior Proposal, ILG
shall again deliver a notice and comply with the requirements of this
_Section 4.2(b)_, except that the notice period shall be three business days
instead of five business days. For purposes of this Agreement, an " _ILG
Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by an ILG
Third Party to enter into an ILG Alternative Transaction (with all references
to 25% in the definition of ILG Alternative Transaction being treated
as references to 50% for these purposes) that (1) did not result from a
breach of _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_, (2) is on terms that the Board of Directors
of ILG determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of

 



60  nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to ILGs stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to
this Agreement that may be proposed by MVW) and (3) that the Board of
Directors of ILG determines in good faith is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the ILG
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of ILG determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of ILG may effect an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event, but only (i) at a time that is after (x) the fifth
business day following MVWs receipt of written notice from ILG advising MVW
of all material information with respect to such Intervening Event and
stating that it intends to make an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change and
providing a full description of its rationale therefor and (y) ILG has
negotiated in good faith with MVW during such five business day period (to the
extent MVW desires to negotiate) with respect to any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by MVW in response
to the Intervening Event and (ii) if after such five business day period and
following the Board of Directors of ILG having taken into account all changes
(if any) to the terms of this Agreement proposed by MVW and any other
information provided by MVW in response to such notice, the Board of Directors
of ILG shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to make an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. " _Intervening
Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was not known by the
Board of Directors of MVW or ILG, as applicable, on the date of this Agreement
(or if known, the consequences of which were not known by such Board of
Directors as of the date of this Agreement), which event or circumstance, or
any consequence thereof, becomes known by the Board of Directors of such party
prior to the time such party receives the ILG Stockholder Approval or the MVW
Stockholder Approval, as applicable; _provided_ that in no event shall any
event or circumstance that relates to an inquiry or proposal, the consummation
of which would constitute an ILG Alternative Transaction or a MVW Alternative
Transaction, as applicable, constitute an Intervening Event.

(c) In addition to the obligations of ILG set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(b),_ ILG shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours
of receipt thereof, advise MVW orally and in writing if ILG or any of its
subsidiaries or their Representatives receives any proposal relating to an
ILG Alternative Transaction, which notice shall include a copy of the
proposal and the identity of the person making such proposal, and ILG shall
keep MVW reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions
of any such proposal, including any material changes, modifications or
amendments thereto, and ILG shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours
of receipt thereof, provide MVW with any written proposal, indication of
interest (or amendment thereto) or any other written material that
constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto) for an ILG Alternative Transaction
or contains material terms thereof, including copies of any proposed
definitive agreements relating to an ILG Alternative Transaction and
any financing commitments related thereto.

 



61 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit ILG from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; _provided_ that any such disclosure or statement that constitutes
or contains an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change shall be subject to the
provisions of _Section 4.2(b)_ (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that a disclosure that constitutes only a "stop, look and listen"
statement or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself be deemed to be an ILG
Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

Section 4.3 _No Solicitation by MVW_.

 

(a) MVW shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its controlled
affiliates or any of its or their officers, directors or employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Representative retained by
it or any of its controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through
another person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which
by any person would constitute a MVW Alternative Transaction or (ii) enter
into, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations with any
person (except to notify such person of the existence of the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_), with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the
making of, any proposal the consummation of which by any person would
constitute a MVW Alternative Transaction (and MVW shall cause any previously
granted physical or electronic data room access provided to any such person to
be immediately terminated); _provided_ that if, at any time prior to obtaining
the MVW Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of MVW determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that any such proposal that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 4.3(a)_  constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a MVW Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with _Section_ _
4.3(c)_, MVW and its Representatives may (A) furnish information with respect
to MVW and its subsidiaries to the person making such proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources) (provided that any such information
that is nonpublic has previously been provided to ILG or is provided to ILG
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as
to confidentiality and non-use generally no less restrictive than the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, any such
confidentiality agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill
restrictions or otherwise restrict the making, amending or modifying of a
proposal regarding an ILG Alternative Transaction) and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources). For purposes of this Agreement, " _MVW
Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than ILG
and its subsidiaries (including Holdco and Ignite Merger Sub) (a " _MVW Third
Party_ "), acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership of more than 25% of the outstanding shares of MVW Common Stock or
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 25% or
more of the voting power of MVW, including pursuant to a stock purchase,
merger, consolidation, tender offer, share exchange or similar transaction
involving MVW or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any transaction pursuant to
which any MVW Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or

 



62  indirectly, assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of MVW and any entity surviving any merger or
combination including any of them) of MVW or any of its subsidiaries
representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
MVW and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iii) any disposition of assets
representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets
of MVW and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 4.3(b),_ neither MVW, the Board of
Directors of MVW nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to ILG, the approval or recommendation by such
Board of Directors or such committee of the issuance of shares of MVW Common
Stock in the Initial Holdco Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any MVW Alternative Transaction (any action
in clause (i) or this clause (ii) being referred to as a " _MVW Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) cause or permit MVW or any of its
controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, term sheet, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating to
any MVW Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 5.1 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, ILG and MVW
shall prepare, and MVW shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Each of ILG and MVW
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4, including the Joint
Proxy Statement, declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. ILG and MVW shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies of any
written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement received from the SEC.
MVW shall provide ILG with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC,
and with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any
other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including
by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
shall be made without the approval of both ILG and MVW, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that with
respect to documents filed by a party that are incorporated by reference in
the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its
business, financial condition or results of operations, or the combined
entity; and _provided_ , _further_ that this approval right shall not apply
with respect to information relating to an ILG Adverse Recommendation Change
or a MVW Adverse Recommendation Change, if applicable. ILG shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
ILGs stockholders, and MVW shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to MVWs stockholders, in each case as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. MVW shall advise ILG promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If at any time prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time any information relating to ILG, MVW or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by ILG or MVW that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of ILG and MVW.

 



65 (b) ILG shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _ILG Stockholders Meeting_ ") in accordance
with the DGCL solely for the purpose of obtaining the ILG Stockholder
Approval and, if applicable, any approvals related thereto including the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, and shall, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval of
the ILG Merger and the Initial Holdco Merger. ILG may only postpone or adjourn
the ILG Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the
purpose of obtaining the ILG Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing
of any supplemental or amended disclosure that ILG has determined after
consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to be required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of ILG prior to the ILG
Stockholders Meeting. In the event that subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of ILG makes an ILG Adverse Recommendation
Change, ILG nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to the holders of shares
of ILG Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining the ILG Stockholder Approval
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
prior to the ILG Stockholders Meeting. ILG shall permit MVW and
its Representatives to attend the ILG Stockholders Meeting.

(c) MVW shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _MVW Stockholders Meeting_ ") in accordance
with the DGCL solely for the purpose of obtaining the MVW Stockholder
Approval and, if applicable, any approvals related thereto including the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, and shall, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _4.3(b)_ ,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval of
the issuance of shares of MVW Common Stock in the Initial Holdco Merger. MVW
may only postpone or adjourn the MVW Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the MVW Stockholder Approval,
(ii) for the absence of a quorum and (iii) to allow reasonable additional time
for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that MVW
has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably
likely to be required under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of MVW
prior to the MVW Stockholders Meeting. In the event that subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of MVW makes a MVW Adverse
Recommendation Change, MVW nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to
the holders of shares of MVW Common Stock for the purpose of obtaining the
MVW Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the MVW Stockholders Meeting. MVW shall
permit ILG and its Representatives to attend the MVW Stockholders Meeting.

(d) ILG and MVW shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the ILG
Stockholders Meeting and the MVW Stockholders Meeting on the same date and as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 



66 Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, each of ILG and MVW shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers, employees and
Representatives of such other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records ( _provided_
that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of such party), and during such period, each of ILG and MVW shall,
and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the other party all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request. Neither party nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement
with any third party ( _provided_ that such party shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of the third party to such disclosure), (ii)
constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege
held by such party or its subsidiaries or (iii) otherwise violate any
Applicable Laws. No review pursuant to this  _Section_ _ 5.2_ shall affect
any representation or warranty given by the other party hereto. Each of ILG
and MVW shall hold, and shall cause its respective affiliates, officers,
employees and Representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
(x) MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger Sub will be permitted
to disclose such information to any debt financing sources or prospective
debt financing sources that may become parties to the MVW Debt Financing, in
connection with securitizations by MVW or its subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement, and to rating agencies (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) and (y) ILG and its subsidiaries will be
permitted to disclose such information in connection with securitizations by
ILG or its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, and to rating
agencies (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors), in
each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), so long as each such person is
made aware of and acknowledges the confidential nature of such information and
agrees to be bound by confidentiality and use restrictions which, in the case
of clause (x) are customary for the syndication of the debt financing
contemplated by such debt financing sources and substantially consistent with
the confidentiality and use restrictions contemplated by the Confidentiality
Agreement or in the Debt Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 20 of the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended to provide that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate on the later of (x) the date on which the Confidentiality
Agreement expires in accordance with its terms and (y) the date that is
twelve months following the date of termination of this Agreement; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any explicit or implicit standstill
restrictions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated
as of the date of this Agreement.

cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Combination Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts for
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities, including

 



67  any required action or non-action under the Antitrust Laws (the " _Required

the case of MVW and _Section 5.15_ in the case of ILG, any necessary or
appropriate financing arrangements, from third parties; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that (A) the consent,
approval or waiver of any third party (other than a Governmental Entity
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ of this
Agreement) shall not be a condition to the consummation of the Combination
Transactions and (B) neither ILG nor MVW nor any of their respective
subsidiaries shall be required to make any payments or concessions in
connection with the fulfillment of their respective obligations in respect of
the matters set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)(ii)_ of the ILG Disclosure
Letter, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,

Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable (and in any event within fifteen business
days after the date of this Agreement), (ii) appropriate filings, if any are
required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and
(iii) all other necessary filings with other Governmental Entities relating to
the Combination Transactions, and, in each case, to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
formally or informally requested pursuant to the Antitrust Laws or by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and
the receipt of the Required Consents as soon as practicable.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ and subject to (b) of the MVW Disclosure
Letter, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Combination Transactions, under
any Antitrust Law for the jurisdictions listed on _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ of
the MVW Disclosure Letter or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or any other applicable Governmental Entity listed on
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ of the MVW Disclosure Letter challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Combination
Transactions, as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the Outside Date, including the Combination Transactions, each of the parties
hereto will take any and all actions necessary to resolve any subject
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the Outside Date, including in order to
resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Combination
Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Outside Date, including selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of
or conducting its

 



68  business in a manner which would resolve such objections or suits or
permitting the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any of its
assets or the assets of its subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in
a manner which would resolve such action or proceeding, in each case so as to
enable the Closing to occur no later than the Outside Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) nothing in this Agreement
shall require, or be construed to require, ILG, MVW or any of their respective
subsidiaries to (and ILG and its subsidiaries shall not, without the prior
written consent of MVW) take any actions, including selling, holding
separate (including by trust or otherwise) or otherwise divesting any of its
businesses or assets or entering into any consent decree or other agreement or
arrangement that would restrict, encumber or otherwise limit ILGs, MVWs or
any of their respective subsidiaries ownership of or freedom of action with
respect to the assets or businesses of MVW or its subsidiaries or ILG or its
subsidiaries if: (A) such actions, either by themselves or taken together,
would be material to the business of MVW, Vistana and their respective
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) such actions, either by themselves or
taken together, would be material to the business of ILG and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (ii) in no event will MVW be required to (a) de-flag a
property unless (x) no inventory from such property has been contributed to
the MVW destination trust or the Sheraton or Westin flex programs and (y) the
property is inside the continental United States or (b) sell, transfer,
license or otherwise forgo exclusive rights existing as of the date hereof
associated with (including exclusive access to Marriott International
systems, services and platforms), or divest, any of the brands listed on
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ of the MVW Disclosure Schedule; and (iii) nothing in
this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, ILG or its
subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action (and ILG and its
subsidiaries shall not take any action without the prior written consent of
MVW) with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(c) Each of the parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Each of
the parties shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any communication
received by that party from, or given by it to, any Governmental Entity and,
subject to Applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the
other partys reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate in any
meeting or substantive discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect
of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Combination
Transactions, unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with
the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and (iii) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Representatives, on the one hand, and any
such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Combination Transactions, _provided_ that materials furnished
pursuant to this _Section _ _5.3(c)_ may be redacted as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



69 Section 5.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, MVW shall
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, a
current or former director or officer of ILG or any of its subsidiaries or who
is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, serving at the request of ILG, as
applicable, or any of its subsidiaries as a current or former director or
officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable
fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of ILG or any of its
subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of ILG or any of its
subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or in respect of any
acts or omissions in their capacities as such directors or officers occurring
prior to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to the same
extent as such Indemnified Parties are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by ILG pursuant to the ILG Charter, the ILG Bylaws or the comparable
organizational documents of any subsidiary of ILG, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements with directors and officers of ILG in existence as
of the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding, (i) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding from MVW to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are
entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by ILG
pursuant to the ILG Charter, the ILG Bylaws or the comparable
organizational documents of any subsidiary of ILG, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements with directors and officers of ILG in existence as
of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
Applicable Law, the ILG Charter or the ILG Bylaws or the comparable
organizational documents of any ILG subsidiary, as applicable, and any
indemnification agreements with directors and officers of ILG in existence as
of the date of this Agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (ii) MVW
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense of any
such matter. In the event that MVW or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, MVW shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of MVW assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4._

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, MVW shall
either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by ILG and its subsidiaries or provide substitute polices for not less than
the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, except that in no event
shall MVW be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies (or
substitute insurance policies) of ILG in respect of any one policy year more
than 300% of the annual premium payable by ILG for such insurance for the

 



70  year ending December 31, 2017 (the " _Annual D andO Cap_"), and if MVW is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.4 _for any
year within such six-year period, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for such year for an annual premium equal to the Annual
DandO Cap; _provided_ that in lieu of the foregoing, ILG may obtain at or prior
to the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
ILGs existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent
that the same may be obtained for an amount that is not in excess of the
maximum aggregate amount otherwise payable for such six-year period under
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_.

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Combination Transactions, (ii) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party
(including the Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her
representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in this _Section 5.5_,
_Section 5.15_ and in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the Combination Transactions, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not the Combination Transactions are
consummated, except that each of MVW and ILG shall bear and pay one-half of
the costs and expenses (other than the fees and expenses of each partys
attorneys and accountants, which shall be borne by the party incurring such
expenses) incurred by the parties hereto in connection with (i) the filing,
printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement (including
SEC filing fees) and (ii) the filings of the pre-merger notification and
report forms under the HSR Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions
(including filing fees).

 

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. ILG, Holdco and Ignite Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and MVW, Volt Corporate Merger Sub and Volt LLC Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) any such press release or public statement as may be required
by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange may be issued prior to such consultation and without such consent if
the party making the release or statement has used its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party prior to issuing such release or
statement, (b) a party may issue a press release or make a public statement
that is consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made
in compliance with the first sentence of this _Section_ _ 5.6_ without such
consultation and without such consent and (c) the first sentence of this
_Section 5.6_ shall not apply with respect to communications relating to an
ILG Adverse Recommendation Change, a MVW Adverse Recommendation Change or any
proposal for an ILG Alternative Transaction or MVW Alternative Transaction.

Section 5.7 _NYSE Listing_. MVW shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the MVW Common Stock issuable under _Article II_ to be approved for listing on
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Closing Date.

 



71 Section 5.8 _Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Combination Transactions to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, including
considering and negotiating in good faith such amendments to this Agreement as
may reasonably be required in order to obtain such qualification (it being
understood that no party shall be required to agree to any such amendment).
The parties shall report the Combination Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including for U.S. Federal income
Tax purposes, in a manner consistent with such qualification. No party shall
take any action, or allow any affiliate to take any action, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent any of the foregoing.

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
delivery of the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_,
including by causing its officers to execute and deliver to counsel
(including, in the event that Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP is
unable to deliver the opinion of counsel referred to in _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)_, to Kirkland and Ellis LLP) letters of representation customary for
transactions of this type at such time or times as counsel may reasonably
request, including at the Closing (and, if required, as of the date of the
Joint Proxy Statement). The parties shall use reasonable best efforts not to
take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or fail
to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction would cause to be
untrue) any of the representations included in the letters of representation
described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)_.

Section 5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto and its respective Board of
Directors shall (i) grant such approvals and take all such actions as are
legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
(ii) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing, MVW shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to each employee of ILG and its subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by MVW and its subsidiaries (the " _ILG Employees_
"), base compensation and cash incentive opportunities that are no less
favorable than the base compensation and cash incentive opportunities provided
to such ILG Employee prior to Closing (excluding any transaction bonuses or
retention payments, and the bonus opportunities disclosed on _Section_ __ _
5.10(a)_ of the ILG Disclosure Letter) and employee benefits (excluding
defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity or
equity-based, and post-employment or retiree health or welfare benefits) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding
defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, equity or
equity-based, and post-employment or retiree health or welfare benefits)
provided to such ILG Employee under the ILG Benefit Plans prior to the
Closing. In addition, MVW shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each ILG
Employee who is terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided to each such ILG Employee prior to the Closing, as disclosed to MVW
in _Section 5.10(a)_ of the ILG

 



72  Disclosure Letter. This _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_ shall not apply to
collectively bargained employees, the terms and conditions of whose employment
shall be determined by the applicable collective bargaining agreement as in
effect from time-to-time. From and after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective
Time, to the extent MVW and its affiliates establish a scheduling bid
practice or program, each ILG Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with ILG or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, before the
Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, consistent with any service crediting
that is granted to similarly situated employees of MVW and its affiliates.

(b) From and after the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, MVW shall cause
to be honored all ILG Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof. For
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and solely with respect to
severance, vacation and paid time off benefits, determining levels of
benefits under each employee benefit plan of MVW and its affiliates (excluding
defined benefit pension, nonqualified deferred compensation, any equity or
equity-based, and post-employment or retiree health or welfare benefits (other
than severance)) providing benefits to any ILG Employee after the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), and subject to Applicable
Law, the terms of the applicable New Plan, and obligations under applicable
collective bargaining or similar agreements, each ILG Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with ILG or any of its subsidiaries,
as the case may be, before the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to the
same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any ILG Benefit Plan of the
same type, as applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits or compensation for the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to
Applicable Law and obligations under applicable collective bargaining or
similar agreements, and solely with respect to the applicable plan year
in which the Closing occurs, MVW shall use or shall cause an affiliate to use
commercially reasonable efforts whereby: (i) each ILG Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans which are welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under an ILG Benefit Plan of the same type, as
applicable, in which such employee participated immediately before the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ");
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any ILG Employee, MVW shall cause (A)
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her eligible covered
dependents to the extent such exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
would not have applied or were satisfied under the corresponding Old Plan,
and (B) eligible expenses incurred by such ILG Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) MVW and ILG hereby acknowledge that a "change in control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of any ILG Benefit Plan will occur at the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time.

 



73 (d) Notwithstanding any permitted amendment, termination or discretion
applicable to any ILG Benefit Plan that provides for the payment of annual
cash bonuses, MVW agrees to, and agrees to cause ILG and each of its
respective subsidiaries and affiliates to pay bonuses to ILG Employees in
respect of calendar year 2018 (" _2018 Bonuses_ ") in an amount equal to the
target 2018 Bonus applicable to each ILG Employee. The 2018 Bonuses shall be
paid by MVW, ILG or their applicable subsidiary or affiliate, as applicable,
at the time or times that the 2018 Bonuses would normally be paid by ILG in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice but in no event
later than March 15, 2019. In the event any ILG Employees employment is
terminated as a result of death or disability or is a termination that would
entitle the ILG Employee to severance under his or her applicable severance
arrangement ( _e.g._ , an applicable employment agreement or ILGs severance
guidelines) prior to the payment of the 2018 Bonus, such ILG Employee shall
be entitled to receive a prorated portion of the target 2018 Bonus applicable
to such ILG Employee, determined in accordance with this Section 5.10(c),
based on the relative portion of the 2018 calendar year during which such
ILG Employee was employed by MVW, ILG and their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates, such prorated target 2018 Bonus to be payable promptly following
the date of such termination.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, express or implied, shall
(i) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the
ability of MVW or ILG or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any person (including any employee) other than the parties to
this Agreement or any right to employment or services or continued employment
or service or to a particular term or condition of employment or service with
MVW or ILG or any of their subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates
or (iv) limit the right of MVW or ILG (or any of their subsidiaries or their
respective affiliates) to terminate the employment or service of any employee
or other service provider following the Closing Date at any time and for any
or no reason. 

Section 5.11 _Board of Directors of MVW_. Prior to the Initial Holdco Merger
Effective Time, MVW shall take all action necessary to cause the Board of
Directors of MVW, as of the Initial Holdco Merger Effective Time, to be
increased by two directors and to cause the persons mutually agreed by ILG and
MVW from the current directors of ILG as of the date of this Agreement to be
appointed to the Board of Directors of MVW.

Section 5.12 _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. MVW and ILG shall each take all such
steps as are reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of ILG
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
MVW (including derivative securities) in connection herewith by any
individual who (a) is a director or officer of ILG or (b) at the Initial
Holdco Merger Effective Time, will become a director or officer of MVW, in
each case to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



74 Section 5.13 _Coordination of Quarterly Dividends_. ILG and MVW shall each
coordinate their record and payment dates for their regular quarterly
dividends to ensure that (a) with respect to the calendar quarter immediately
preceding the calendar quarter in which the Closing Date occurs, (i) ILG
stockholders shall receive a regular quarterly dividend from ILG with respect
to such quarter, and (ii) MVW stockholders shall receive a regular quarterly
dividend from MVW with respect to such quarter, and (b) with respect to the
calendar quarter in which the Closing Date occurs, (i) ILG does not declare

bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further

remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

 

(b) In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to

located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, the Combination Transactions or any of the other transactions

court). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees (A) that any Action of any kind or description,

or permit any of their affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing
any such Action in any other courts, other than a state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, (C) to waive
and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue

action in any such court, and (D) that any such claim, controversy or dispute
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state that

Commitment Letter and any definitive documents related thereto, (A) none of
the parties hereto nor any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or

contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (B) no MVW Debt Financing Related Party

 



97  shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any
party hereto or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for
any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

Section 8.11 _Headings, etc._ The headings and table of contents contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ with respect thereto. Upon a determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify

as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.
