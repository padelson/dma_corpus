(&#147;<U>TCC</U>&#148;), in favor of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (&#147;<U>Teva</U>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">PREAMBLE </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the date of this Guarantee, CooperSurgical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>CSI</U>&#148;), which is a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of TCC, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement between CSI and Teva (in its current form and as it may be amended in accordance with its terms, the&nbsp;&#147;<U>APA</U>&#148;) in which CSI agreed to purchase certain assets related to
Teva&#146;s Paragard intrauterine copper contraceptive device business, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the APA (the&nbsp;&#147;<U>Transaction</U>&#148;). As an inducement for Teva to enter into the APA, TCC is willing to
guarantee CSI&#146;s obligations under the APA on the terms and conditions set out in this Guarantee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ACCORDINGLY, TCC hereby agrees as
follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. <U>Guarantee</U>. As an inducement for Teva to enter into the APA, TCC, for itself and for its successors and assigns, hereby
guarantees, on the terms and conditions set out in this Guarantee, the payment and performance when due of all liabilities, covenants and agreements of CSI contained in, or arising under, the APA (the&nbsp;&#147;<U>Guaranteed Obligations</U>&#148;).
If CSI fails to make any payment or perform any covenant or agreement that it is obligated to pay or perform under the Guaranteed Obligations, TCC shall promptly and fully make, or cause to be made, that payment or perform, or cause to be performed,
that covenant in place of CSI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. <U>Scope</U>. This Guarantee applies to the Guaranteed Obligations, and not to any other obligations
that CSI or any other Person may otherwise have to Teva. &#147;<U>Person</U>&#148; shall be construed broadly and means an individual or an entity of any kind. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. <U>Defenses</U>. TCC shall not have any liability under this Guarantee or under the APA, under any legal theory, whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, other than as explicitly set out in this Guarantee or in the APA, as applicable. TCC shall be entitled to assert, as defenses to TCC&#146;s obligations under this Guarantee, any and all defenses that CSI may have
under the APA or any other agreement entered into by CSI and Teva in connection with the Transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. <U>Nature of Guarantee</U>. This
is a guarantee of payment and performance, not of collection, and Teva shall not be required to pursue any remedies it may have against CSI under the APA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. <U>TCC Waivers</U>. Without waiving or limiting any provision of the APA, TCC hereby waives (a)&nbsp;notice of acceptance of this Guarantee
by any Person, (b)&nbsp;notice of the amount of indebtedness or extent of performance owing under this Guarantee, (c)&nbsp;notice of demand for payment, notice of default or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-payment</FONT> or <FONT
