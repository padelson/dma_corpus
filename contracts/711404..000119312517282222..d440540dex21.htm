iii ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of September 11, 2017 (this
"Agreement"), is made by and between CooperSurgical, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer") and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd _._ , a company
organized under the laws of Israel ("Seller"). Capitalized terms used herein
shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the text of this Agreement
or in _Section 9.1_.

R E C I T A L S:

 

WHEREAS, Seller, directly and indirectly through certain of its Affiliates,
owns, licenses or otherwise holds certain rights to manufacture, promote,
market, distribute and/or sell the Paragard intrauterine copper contraceptive
device, having the SKU set forth in _Schedule 1.3_, in the United States (the
"Products" and such business in the corresponding territories, the
"Business"); and

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell (or cause to be sold), and Buyer desires to
purchase or cause certain of its Affiliates to purchase, certain assets
related to the Business and Buyer is willing to assume or cause certain of its
Affiliates to assume certain liabilities related to the Business, in each
case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

SALE AND PURCHASE OF ASSETS, ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

Section 1.1 _Sale and Purchase_.

 

(a) _Transferred Assets_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the
Closing, Seller will, and will cause the Selling Affiliates to, sell, convey,
assign and transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept, as
a going concern, the Transferred Assets, in each case free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 

(b) _Excluded Assets_. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer
is not purchasing pursuant to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby any right, title or interest in any Excluded Asset.

(c) _Assumed Liabilities_. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume or cause
certain of its Affiliates to assume the Assumed Liabilities and shall agree to
satisfy and discharge when due the liabilities and obligations of Seller and
its Affiliates in respect of the Assumed Liabilities. After the Closing,
Buyer shall pay or cause certain of its Affiliates to pay all Assumed
Liabilities as and when such Assumed Liabilities become due.

 

(d) _Excluded Liabilities_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Excluded
Liability. Seller and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be, will remain
liable to pay, perform and discharge when due, all Excluded Liabilities.

 

(e) _Business Transfer Documents_. To the extent required under applicable Law
or as reasonably deemed necessary by either of the parties hereto, to effect
the transactions contemplated hereunder, the parties shall execute and
deliver, or cause their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver, such
asset and/or business transfer agreements, bills of sale, deeds (which, with
respect to the Transferred  Real Property, will be a bargain and sale deed with covenant against
grantors acts), assignments, assumptions and other documents and instruments
of sale, conveyance, assignment, novation, transfer and assumption (the
"Business Transfer Documents") as are necessary to effect any transfer of the
Transferred Assets or the Employees at the Closing or such other time for
transfer as contemplated by  _Section 1.1(g)_ or _Section 4.5_ below or any
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing. The Business Transfer
Documents shall be in form and substance reasonably agreed to by the parties
and as is usual and customary in the applicable jurisdiction; _provided_ that
the parties agree and acknowledge that the Business Transfer Documents are
intended solely to formalize the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
order to comply with any applicable Law and shall be, in all respects,
consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. In the
event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and a Business Transfer
Document, this Agreement shall control.

 

(f) _Designation of Affiliates; Performance of Obligations by Affiliates_. To
the extent that any of the Transferred Assets are under the control of any of
Sellers Affiliates, Seller shall cause such Affiliates to promptly take such
legal action as may be necessary to consummate the transfer to Buyer of such
Transferred Assets under terms and conditions which are consistent with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement. Any obligation of Seller under or
pursuant to this Agreement may be satisfied, met or fulfilled, in whole or in
part, at Sellers sole and exclusive option, either by Seller directly, or by
any Affiliate of Seller that Seller causes to satisfy, meet or fulfill such
obligation, in whole or in part. Without otherwise limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall cause Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva USA") to transfer
the Transferred Real Property to Buyer, and Teva Womens Health, LLC to
transfer the Transferred Real Property Leases to Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 1.1(f)_ shall not be construed to relieve Seller
from any of its obligations under this Agreement.

(g) _Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent_. To the extent that
the sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer or attempted sale, conveyance,
assignment or transfer to Buyer of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any
applicable Law or would require any governmental or third-party consent,
authorization, approval or waiver and such consent, authorization, approval
or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute a sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer thereof.
During the period commencing on the date of the Closing and continuing until
180 calendar days after the Closing, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such
consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers; _provided_ that neither Seller
nor its Affiliates shall be required to pay any consideration or other
amounts, or to commence, defend or participate in any Litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party, in
connection with the foregoing. Unless otherwise provided in any Ancillary
Agreement, until the earlier of (i) such 180 calendar day period and (ii) the
date such consent, authorization, approval or waiver is obtained, Seller and
Buyer shall enter into an arrangement whereby Buyer or its applicable
Affiliates are provided the rights, benefits and obligations of such
Transferred Asset and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all costs and amounts
incurred by Seller or any Selling Affiliate in connection with
such arrangement, which arrangement may include Seller or a Selling Affiliate
using Inventory purchased by Buyer hereunder to satisfy obligations of Seller
or a Selling Affiliate under existing Contracts. If such consent,
authorization, approval or waiver is obtained, Seller shall or shall cause
the Selling Affiliates to assign, convey and transfer any such Transferred
Asset to Buyer at no additional cost. If such consent, authorization, approval
or waiver is not obtained notwithstanding the parties compliance with the
foregoing obligations, Seller will be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations
under this Agreement and under no circumstances shall the Purchase Price be
reduced or Seller or its Affiliates be subject to any liability on account of
the failure to obtain any such consent, authorization, approval or waiver.
Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement shall be breached or deemed breached, and
no condition to Buyers obligations to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than the condition set out in _Section 6.2(b)_, shall
be deemed not satisfied as a result of (x) the failure to obtain any such 

 



2  consent, authorization, approval or waiver or as a result of any resulting
default or termination or (y) any lawsuit, action, claim, investigation or
proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent, authorization, approval
or waiver or any resulting default or termination. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, _Section 4.5_ and not this  _Section 1.1(g)_ shall
govern the transfer of any Shared Contracts.

(h) _Buyer s Recording and Similar Responsibilities._ Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.1_, it shall be Buyers
responsibility (i) to prepare the applicable Trademark assignments, which
shall be in the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_ , and to
record such assignments following execution thereof by Seller or a Selling
Affiliate at the Closing and (ii) to bear the fees and other costs in
accordance with _Section 1.5_ and any Taxes arising from such activities.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the Transferred
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (the "Closing") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time through the execution and
exchange, via .pdf copies of originally signed documents, of the documents and
agreements contemplated herein on the date that is four (4) Business Days
after the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such
time), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties. Buyer specifically acknowledges that time is of the essence because
Sellers intention to exit the Business is or will become known to its
employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with Seller. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to hereinafter as the
"Closing Date." At the Closing:

 

(a) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless previously
delivered), the following:

 

(i) the officers certificate referred to in _Section 6.2(a)_;

 

(ii) duly executed counterparts of the Ancillary Agreements; and

 

(iii) a certificate of Teva USA, prepared in accordance with Treas. Reg.
§1.1445-2(b)(2), certifying under penalties of perjury that Teva USA is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller, or as designated
by Seller, one or more of Sellers Affiliates (unless previously delivered),
the following:

(i) the Purchase Price;

 

(ii) the officers certificate referred to in _Section 6.3(a)_; and

 

(iii) duly executed counterparts of the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 1.3 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
Seller, or Sellers applicable Subsidiary or assignee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller at
least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to the
Purchase Price plus the Buyer Portion of PDUFA Fees.

 



3 (b) _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Inventory Statement") setting
forth Sellers determination of the value of the Inventory transferred to
Buyer as of the Closing (as of 11:59 P.M., local time, on the Closing Date)
(the "Closing Inventory"), Sellers determination of Prepaid Inventory
transferred to Buyer as of the Closing (as of 11:59 P.M., local time, on the
Closing Date) and a calculation of the amount, if any, payable pursuant to
clause (g) of this _Section 1.3_. In connection with the preparation of the
Inventory Statement, Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its Affiliates to
assist, Seller, its accountants, advisors and other representatives in its
preparation of the Inventory Statement and (B) afford to Seller, its
accountants, advisors and other representatives, reasonable access during
normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and records of the
Business to the extent relevant to the preparation of the Inventory Statement
(including any taking and preparing with Buyers participation of physical
counts of Inventory). For purposes of this _Section 1.3_, the value of the
Inventory transferred to Buyer will be determined by reference to the price
for each Product and other type or item of Inventory as set forth on _Schedule
1.3_ to this Agreement shall include only Inventory that (A) has been approved
and released by Seller or such applicable Selling Affiliate
appointed qualified person in compliance with applicable Laws, (B) has an
unexpired shelf life of not less than twelve (12) months, or such lesser
period as may be agreed by Buyer and Seller on a Product-by-Product basis, (C)
has not been damaged, recalled and/or incorrectly packaged or labeled and (D)
consists of active pharmaceutical ingredients, spare parts, raw materials,
containers, packaging and packaging supplies and work-in-process.

 

(ii) For the purposes of clarification only, Seller is retaining all Pre-
Closing Accounts Payable and Pre-Closing Accounts Receivable and the only
Purchase Price adjustment after the Closing will be the adjustment of the
Inventory and Prepaid Inventory pursuant to this _Section 1.3_.

 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. The Inventory Statement shall become final, binding and
conclusive upon Seller and Buyer on the 30th day following Buyers receipt of
the Inventory Statement (or the earlier date, if any, on which Buyer confirms
to Seller in writing its agreement with the Inventory Statement), unless prior
to such 30th day Buyer delivers to Seller a written notice (a "Dispute
Notice") stating that Buyer believes the Inventory Statement contains
mathematical errors (including quantity of Inventory transferred to Buyer or
the amount of Prepaid Inventory), or was not prepared by reference to the
price for each Product as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ to this Agreement or
otherwise was not prepared in accordance with Section 1.3(b)(i) and
specifying in reasonable detail each item that Buyer disputes (each, a
"Disputed Item"), the amount in dispute for each Disputed Item and the reasons
supporting Buyers positions. Buyer shall not challenge the Inventory
Statement on any other basis, and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with
all other items and amounts contained in the Inventory Statement delivered
pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)(i)_.

 

(d) _Resolution Period_. If Buyer delivers a Dispute Notice, then Seller and
Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items during the
15-calendar day period beginning on the date Seller receives the Dispute
Notice (the "Resolution Period"). If Seller and Buyer reach agreement with
respect to any Disputed Items, Seller shall revise the Inventory Statement to
reflect such agreement.

(e) _Independent Accountant_. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of
the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then Buyer and Seller shall
jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed Items (the "Unresolved
Items") to the Independent Accountant; _provided_ that if Buyer and Seller do
not appoint an Independent Accountant within ten (10) calendar days after the
end of the Resolution Period, they shall request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint as the Independent Accountant a partner in the New York
office of a nationally recognized independent

 



4  registered public accounting firm that has not had a material relationship
with Buyer or Seller within the preceding two years, and such appointment
shall be final, binding and conclusive on Buyer and Seller. The Independent
Accountant shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Seller and not by independent review, only the
Unresolved Items still in dispute and shall be limited to those adjustments,
if any, required to be made for the Inventory Statement to comply with the
provisions of this Agreement. The parties shall agree, promptly after the
Independent Accountant has been appointed, on procedures governing the
resolution of any dispute by the Independent Accountant; _provided_ that if
the parties fail to agree on such procedures, the dispute resolution
procedures of the American Arbitration Association shall govern. Buyer and
Seller shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items
within thirty (30) calendar days after such items are submitted for review.
The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the
Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this _Section 1.3(e)_
and the price for each Product as set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ to this
Agreement, and in no event shall the Independent Accountants determination
of the Unresolved Items be for an amount that is outside the range of Buyers
and Sellers disagreement. Each party shall furnish to the Independent
Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to
the Unresolved Items as are in its possession or under its control as the
Independent Accountant may reasonably request. The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer
and Seller absent manifest error, and Seller shall revise the Inventory
Statement to reflect such determination upon receipt thereof. The fees,
expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Seller.

 

(f) _Access to Information_. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide promptly to the other party all information as such other party
shall reasonably request in connection with review of the Inventory Statement
or the Dispute Notice, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate in
good faith with such other party to arrive at a final determination of
the Inventory Statement.

(g) _Final Adjustment_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Inventory
Statement is finalized pursuant to clause (c), (d) or (e) of this _Section
1.3_:

(i) if Closing Inventory is more than the product of (A) 105% _multiplied by_
(B) the Inventory Target, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Closing Inventory _minus_ the Inventory Target; or

 

(ii) if Closing Inventory is less than the product of (A) 95% _multiplied by_
(B) the Inventory Target, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the Inventory Target _minus_ the Closing Inventory; _plus_

(iii) if the amount of Prepaid Inventory set forth on the Inventory Statement
is greater than zero (0), then Buyer shall pay such amount of Prepaid
Inventory to Seller.

 

(h) _Method of Payment_. Any amount paid in respect of adjustments to the
Purchase Price made pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ shall be (i) made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
receiving party and (ii) treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
including for tax reporting purposes.

 

Section 1.4 _Withholding_. Buyer shall make all payments under this Agreement
free and clear of all deductions and withholdings in respect of Taxes, unless
any such deduction or withholding is required by Law in effect at the time of
payment. If any Taxes are required by Law in effect at the time of payment to
be deducted from or in respect of any amount payable under this Agreement:
(a) such amount payable shall be increased as necessary to ensure that, after
all required deductions for Taxes are

 



5  made (including deductions applicable to any increases to any amount payable
under this _Section 1.4_), Seller or any applicable Selling Affiliate
receives the amount it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(b) Buyer shall make such deductions and timely pay the full amount deducted
to the Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and (c) Buyer
shall deliver to Seller an original or certified copy of a receipt evidencing
such payment, _except_ that clause (a) of this sentence shall not apply to any
withholding required under Section 1445 of the Code or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent any U.S. real property
interests are allocated to a non-U.S. Selling Affiliate on _Schedule 1.6_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will provide written notice to Seller
promptly upon any determination that withholding may be required on any
payments under this Agreement and each party shall take such steps as the
other party may reasonably request and otherwise cooperate with the other
party to reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding.

 

Section 1.5 _Transfer Taxes and Other Costs_.

 

 __(a) All Transfer Taxes payable on or in connection with the transfer of the
Transferred Assets to Buyer and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer when due in compliance with
applicable Transfer Tax Laws; _provided_ that if Seller is required by
applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes, then Seller shall pay such Transfer
Taxes, and Buyer shall, subject to receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence
of Sellers payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller in dollars (or, at
Sellers request, reimburse a Selling Affiliate in local currency),
whether or not such Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the
applicable Governmental Authority. __

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their

reference. The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time it shall automatically terminate. From
and after the Closing: (i) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other

by judicial or administrative process or pursuant to applicable Law or the
rules of any securities exchange to which that party is subject or such
information can be shown to have been in the public domain through no fault of
the applicable party.  

 



17  Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall

Section 4.4 _Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate (i) to

applications with and to, and obtain all licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of, applicable
Governmental Authorities to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) to obtain consents from other Persons, if any, listed on

following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the United States Department of
Justice (the "DOJ") and any other Governmental Authority, in each case to the
extent applicable, all notification and report forms that may be required for
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter provide as promptly as
practicable any supplemental information requested in connection therewith
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law and (B) include in each
such filing, notification and report form referred to in the immediately
preceding _clause (A)_ a request for early termination or acceleration of any
applicable waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the

filings, notifications and report forms. In connection therewith, Seller and
Buyer shall:

 



18 (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act and other Competition Laws;

 

(ii) subject to applicable Laws and a partys confidential information,
including revenues for products for which NAICS codes are provided and Item 4
(c) and (d) documents, provide outside competition law counsel for the other
party with a draft of any filing or submission and a reasonable opportunity to
review such draft before making or causing to be made such filing or
submission, and consider in good faith the views of outside competition law
counsel for such other party regarding such filing or submission;

 

(iii) not extend any applicable waiting or review periods or enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on the Closing Date, except
with the prior written consent of the other party;

 

(iv) not have any substantive contact with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this _Section 4.4(b)_
unless, to the extent practicable, they have engaged in prior consultation
with the other party and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, given the other party the opportunity to participate; and 

(v) to the extent permitted by Laws, keep each other apprised of the status of
any material communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable
Governmental Authority.

Buyer further agrees to utilize its best efforts to take any and all actions
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, including:

(vi) the prompt use of its best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or
other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including:

(A) the defense through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in
any court, agency or other proceeding by any Person, including any
Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions;

 

(B) the proffer and agreement by Buyer, no later than sixty (60) calendar days
from the date of this Agreement, of its willingness to sell, divest, lease,
license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition,
and promptly to effect the sale, divestiture, lease, license, disposal and
holding separate of (subject to the proviso set forth herein), any
contraceptive and sterilization products, product lines or interests
(including any complementary or ancillary products, product lines or interests
related to contraceptive or sterilization products) therein of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries that are not Transferred Assets (together, "Buyer C/S
Interests") (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of,
the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect thereto); provided, however,
that if the representations of Buyer

 



19  set forth in _Section 3.8_ are inaccurate, this clause (B) shall apply
instead to all assets, rights, product lines, categories of assets or
businesses or other operations or interests of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries that are not Transferred Assets (together, "Buyer Interests");

 

(C) the proffer and agreement by Buyer of its willingness to take such other
actions, and promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental
Authority giving effect thereto), in each case with respect to Buyer C/S
Interests or, if the representations of Buyer set forth in _Section 3.8_ are
inaccurate, Buyer Interests, no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the
date of this Agreement, in each case if such action should be reasonably
necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual,
anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any forum or
(y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental
Authority; and

(vii) the prompt use of its best efforts to take, in the event that any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal
thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or
threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement.

Nothing in this  _Section 4.4(b)_ shall obligate Buyer to agree to any
divestitures or other remedy in each case not conditioned on the consummation
of the Closing.

 

(c) Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit its respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture,
collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected
to delay or increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under antitrust or Competition Laws with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, the PDUFA Fee, in full, on or
before the earlier of (y) the date on which the PDUFA Fee is due under
applicable Laws and (z) the Closing Date. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall: (i) file Transfer
Letters with the applicable Governmental Authority to transfer ownership of
the Regulatory Registration for the transferred Products, (ii) take such
actions, if any, as are reasonably required, to ensure that the PDUFA Fee
paid by Seller for the transferred Products continues to be credited to the
transferred Products following the transfer of ownership of the Regulatory
Registration for the transferred Products, and (iii) submit all appropriate
and necessary documentation with respect to FDA approval by the applicable
Governmental Authority of the removal of Trademarks of the Seller or its
Affiliates and the inclusion of Buyers name, corporate logo and National Drug
Code on Product labeling. Transfer of title to any Regulatory Registration
for the Products shall be effective as of the Closing. As promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Closing, Buyer shall apply for and
initiate applicable processes to obtain, establish and begin using its own
National Drug Code for the Products, and shall promptly notify Seller thereof.

 



20 __Section 4.5 _Shared Contracts_ __. Following the Closing, the parties
desire for the benefit of Seller and Buyer, respectively, to have and obtain
the rights and benefits under each Shared Contract to the extent related to
the continuing business of Buyer and Seller and its Affiliates. The parties
shall cooperate with each other to provide Seller and its Affiliates and
Buyer and its Affiliates with their applicable rights and benefits under each
Shared Contract _first_ , by effecting a partial assignment of such Shared
Contract or, if unable to effect such partial assignment, _second_ , by
assisting Buyer in entering into a new Contract or Contracts with the
applicable third party on substantially similar terms (a " __Separated
Contract __"). The costs of entering into a new Contract or Contract(s) shall
be borne by Buyer. If any Shared Contract cannot be partially assigned or
separated into a Separated Contract at Closing, Seller and Buyer shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable
commercial efforts to cause, for the period after the Closing until such
Shared Contract is separated into a Separated Contract or such Separated
Contract expires pursuant to its terms, (i) the rights and benefits under
each Shared Contract to the extent relating to the Business to be enjoyed by
Buyer; (ii) the Liabilities under each Shared Contract to the extent relating
to the Business to be borne by Buyer; (iii) the rights and benefits under each
Shared Contract to the extent relating to any business other than the
Business to be enjoyed by Seller; and (iv) the Liabilities under each Shared
Contract to the extent relating to any business other than the Business to be
borne by Seller. __

 

Section 4.6 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date, at
the request of another party, without further consideration and at the
expense of the party so requesting, each of the parties shall execute and
deliver to such requesting party, or shall cause to be executed and delivered
to such requesting party, such additional instruments or documents, and shall
take or cause to be taken such other action, as such requesting party may
reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.7 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, Buyer shall consult with Seller and obtain Sellers express prior
written consent, which Seller shall not unreasonably withhold or delay, before
distributing any communications to any Employee whether relating to employee
benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise. Buyer shall
provide Seller with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to
comment on the form and content of, all such communications.

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall periodically
provide a list to Buyer prior to the Closing Date, which shall be included on
_Schedule 4.7(c)_ , to reflect new hires, leaves of absence, employee
transfers and employment terminations and any other material changes to
_Section 2.13_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and provide copies of such
updated lists and information to Buyer.

 

(c) Buyer shall provide offers of employment to all Employees listed on
_Schedule 4.7(c)_ upon the occurrence of the Closing. Offers pursuant to this
_Section 4.7(c)_ shall (i) be for a comparable position at the same or a
nearby geographic work location with a commute of no more than thirty (30)
miles from Employees office immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii)
shall provide to each Employee, until December 31, 2018, (y) no less favorable
base salary, wage rate and bonus opportunity, as applicable, than as set forth
opposite such Employees name on list provided pursuant to _Section 4.7(b)_
and (z) employee benefits that are comparable to the benefits provided to
Buyers employees in comparable positions, including Buyers medical plan and
401(k) plan and, for those employees who remain continuously in Buyers
service through the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyers
defined benefit pension plan, (iii) be sufficient to avoid statutory,
contractual, common Law or other severance obligations, and (iv) otherwise
comply in all respects with applicable Law (including with

 



21  respect to compensation and benefits). Buyer shall assume the liability to
provide each Employee with the same amount of paid-time off as the Employee
had immediately prior to Closing. Employee then shall accrue any further
paid-time off in accordance with Buyers policies. Buyer shall assume the
liability to provide severance benefits to each Employee that are no less
favorable than the better of (i) those severance or termination benefits
applicable to such Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) those provided under Buyers severance plan, program, policy or practice
(whether contractual or otherwise) on the date of such Employees
termination, in each case including all service with Seller and its Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date as service with Buyer and its Affiliates for purpose
of calculating entitlement to severance pay and termination
benefits thereunder.

(d) With respect to Employees, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize,
for all purposes (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan) under all plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by
Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Employees, service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was
recognized under the corresponding Listed Plan covering such Employees,
including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and
accruals, in each case, except where it would result in a duplication of
benefits and (ii) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-
work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and other welfare
benefit plans established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the
benefit of the Employees, to the greatest extent permitted by those plans,
except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or
waiting period would have applied to such individual under the corresponding
Listed Plan. Effective as of the Closing, each Employee shall cease to be an
employee of Seller or the applicable Affiliate and shall cease to participate
in any Business Employee Benefit Plan or other employee compensation, benefit
or welfare plan of Seller or any of its Affiliates as an active employee.

(e) Buyer shall cause a defined contribution plan with a Code Section 401(k)
feature of which it is the plan sponsor to (i) cover all Employees as of
immediately after the Closing Date, (ii) recognize service with Seller and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date for all purposes and (iii) accept a
transfer of assets representing the full balance standing to the credit of
accounts of all Employees from Sellers (or its applicable Affiliates) 401(k)
plan, but not a transfer of any participant loans or related promissory notes
under that plan, within sixty (60) calendar days of the Closing Date and
shall cause the transfer to comply with the requirements of applicable Law,
including without limitation Code Section 411(d)(6). No later than the date on
which those assets are transferred from Sellers (or its applicable
Affiliates) 401(k) plan to Buyers 401(k) plan, Buyer shall offer, or cause
to be offered, loans to the individuals listed on _Schedule 4.7(e)_, in
amounts not exceeding, for each individual, the lesser of (y) the then-
current balance of that individuals loan from Sellers (or its applicable
Affiliates) 401(k) plan and (z) the outstanding balance of that loan set out
in _Schedule 4.7(e)_, on the further terms and conditions set out in this
_Section 4.7(e)_. Seller shall, no later than 10 Business Days before the
asset transfer, notify Buyer in writing of the payment instructions for paying
off the outstanding loans under Sellers (or its applicable Affiliates)
401(k) plan, and Buyer shall disburse its loans to those payment instructions
in satisfaction of the outstanding loans under Sellers (or its applicable
Affiliates) 401(k) plan. The interest rate payable under each of Buyers
loans shall be the interest rate set out in _Schedule 4.7(e)_. The maturity
date of each of Buyers loans shall be the final payment date for the relevant
individual set out in _Schedule 4.7(e)_, except that Buyer may accelerate
the maturity of each loan to the date that is 30 days after the date on which
the relevant individual becomes eligible to borrow under Buyers 401(k) plan.

 

(f) Buyer or its Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to the termination of Employees hired by Buyer, including any
statutory or common law severance or other separation benefits, any
contractual or other severance or separation benefits and any other legally
mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a
mandatory termination

 



22  notice period and any payments pursuant to an Order of a court having
jurisdiction over the parties). To the extent any Employee does not accept the
offer of employment with Buyer, Seller shall provide the Employee with a
severance and release agreement and bear the costs associated with the
severance and termination.

(g) In the United States, pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Buyer
and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall apply the "standard" method
for purposes of employee payroll reporting with respect to any Employee.

 

(h) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any Employee
are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall
not create any right in any other person, including any Employee (or dependent
or beneficiary of any of the foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an
amendment of any plan providing benefits to any Employee.

 

Section 4.8 _Supplemental Disclosure_. Seller and Buyer shall have the right,
from time to time prior to the Closing, to supplement or amend the Seller
Disclosure Letter and the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, with
respect to any matter hereafter arising (other than as a result of a knowing
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to supplement or amend
the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may
be) that, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Seller Disclosure Letter or
Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may be. Any such supplemental or amended
disclosure shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of determining whether or not the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_  have been satisfied, but not for
purposes of indemnification set forth in _Article 8_.

Section 4.9 _Publicity_. No party to this Agreement shall originate any
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, written or oral,
whether relating to this Agreement or any documents or transactions
contemplated hereby or the existence of any arrangement between the parties,
without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably
withheld) whether or not named in such publicity, news release or other
similar public announcement, except (i) Seller and Buyer and their Affiliates
may issue a press release in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and (ii) either party may originate any such publicity, news
release or other similar public announcement as may be required by Law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities;
_provided_ that in such event under _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , the issuing
party shall still be required to consult with the other party, whether or not
named in such publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, a
reasonable time prior to its release to allow the other party to comment
thereon and, after its release, shall provide the other party with a copy
thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such non-issuing party shall not
have provided its consent to the issuing partys request for consent and/or
consultation pursuant to the foregoing after one (1) Business Day, the issuing
party shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations pursuant to this
provision and shall be free to issue such publicity, news release or other
similar public announcement. If Buyer or Seller, based on the advice of its
counsel, determines that this Agreement, or any of the Ancillary Agreements,
must be publicly filed with a Governmental Authority, then the filing party,
prior to making any such filing, shall provide the other party and its counsel
with a redacted version of this Agreement (and any other Ancillary
Agreement) which it intends to file, and will give due consideration to any
comments provided by the other party or its counsel and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the confidential treatment by such Governmental
Authority of those sections specified by the non-filing party and its
counsel.

Section 4.10 _Insurance_. The coverage under all insurance policies
related to the Business and arranged or maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates is only for the benefit of Seller and its Affiliates, and not for
the benefit of Buyer or the Business. As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business and
agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of Sellers or its
Affiliates insurance policies which may provide coverage for claims relating
in any way to the Business.

 



23 Section 4.11 _Assurances_. For a period of up to eighteen months after the
Closing Date, if either Buyer or Seller becomes aware that any of the
Transferred Assets has not been transferred to Buyer or that any of the
Excluded Assets has been transferred to Buyer, it shall promptly notify the
other and the parties hereto shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and,
subject to _Section 1.1(e)_, ensure that such property is transferred, at
Buyers expense and with any necessary prior third-party consent or approval,
to:

 

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset which was not transferred to
Buyer at the Closing; or

 

(b) Seller, in the case of any Excluded Asset which was transferred to Buyer
at the Closing.

 

Section 4.12 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Selling Affiliates have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action
required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and
the Selling Affiliates with the provisions of any bulk sale or bulk
transfer Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.13  _Payments from Third Parties; Correspondence_.

(a) Except as expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, in the event
that, on or after the Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments
or other funds due to the other pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or of
any Ancillary Agreement, then the party receiving such funds shall promptly
forward such funds to the proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree
there is no right of offset regarding such payments and a party may not
withhold funds received from third parties for the account of the other party
in the event there is a dispute regarding any other issue under this
Agreement or of any Ancillary Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, any
payments or other funds received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates from a
third party in respect of any Product(s) shall first be applied against
any outstanding undisputed receivable held by Seller or any applicable
Selling Affiliate in respect of such Product(s) for any period prior to
Closing and only after all such undisputed receivables have been satisfied
shall any payments or other funds received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
from a third party in respect of any Product(s) be deemed in respect of
receivables for any period after the Closing.

 

(b) From and after the Closing until the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, (i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
to be delivered to Buyer any mail or other communications received by Seller
or any of its Affiliates from any Person in respect of any Product with
respect to the period after the Closing and (ii) Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Seller or its
applicable Selling Affiliate any mail or other communications received by
Buyer or its Affiliates from any Person either intended for Seller or any of
its Affiliates and not related to any Product or Transferred Asset or
regarding any Product or Transferred Asset with respect to the period prior to
the Closing. The provisions of this _Section 4.13(b)_ are not intended to,
and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by any of Seller or
Buyer to permit the other to accept service of process on its behalf and
neither Seller nor Buyer are or shall be deemed to be the agent of the other
for service of process purposes.

 



24 Section 4.14 _Retained Trademarks_. Except as expressly permitted in the
Trademark License Agreement substantially in the form as attached as _Exhibit
D_ (the " __Trademark License Agreement __"), Buyer covenants that neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall use in any manner any Trademark
or trade dress of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Trademarks
included in the Transferred IP), including those set forth on _Schedule 4.14_.

 

Section 4.15 _Mutual Non-Solicitation_. From and after the Closing Date,
Seller and Buyer each agree that they shall not, and they shall each cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to not, for a period of one (1)
year after such Closing Date, directly or indirectly, encourage, induce, or
solicit (a) in the case of Seller, any Employee to leave employment with
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (b) in the case of Buyer, any employee of
Seller or any of its Affiliates who at any time provided services to the
Business; _provided_ , that this clause shall not preclude Seller, Buyer or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from (a) posting a general
solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing by or on
behalf of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
as applicable, that is not targeted at employees of such other party or (b)
soliciting any terminated employee of such other party so long as such former
employee has been terminated from the employment with Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as applicable, for more than six
(6) months.

Section 4.16 _Scope of Transition Services_. Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall reasonably co-operate as
to the separation of the Business from Sellers other business and planning
Buyers integration of the Business, so as to reduce the number and scope
of services to be provided in the Transition Services Agreement substantially
in the form as attached as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_
"). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall complete the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement, which shall
provide for a term not to exceed six (6) months following the Closing Date
and, without limiting Buyers rights under _Section 2.2_ of the Transition
Services Agreement with respect to any Omitted Service (as such term is
defined in the Transition Services Agreement), shall be limited to commercial,
regulatory, pharmacovigilance/quality and corporate functions and services in
a manner and scope of such services and functions not to exceed the manner
and scope of such services and functions that had been provided by the Seller
or a Seller Affiliate to the Business in the 12 month period prior to the
Closing Date but are not (a) provided by Employees hired by Buyer, (b)
provided by independent contractors under Transferred Contracts or (b)
included in the Transferred Assets. Without limiting the generality of the
immediately preceding sentence, if Seller has not filed with the FDA the
annual report for the Product under 21 C.F.R. 314.81(b)(ii), the services to
be provided under the Transition Services Agreement will include services
related to the preparation of that annual report. Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 4.16_ shall require or
permit Seller, Buyer or their Affiliates to conduct any integration activities
to the extent that the same are prohibited by Competition Laws.

 

Section 4.17 _Claims Administration_. Buyer shall, at Sellers request,
provide claim administration services with respect to Seller Product Claims
(" __Claim Services __"), on the terms and conditions set out in this _Section
4.17_. "Seller Product Claims" means lawsuits or other claims, regardless of
when commenced or made and irrespective of the legal theory asserted, arising
from or relating to the design, manufacture, testing, advertising, marketing,
distribution or sale of any unit of Product inserted in a patient on or before
the Closing Date, including all liabilities and obligations arising from or
relating to (x) warranty obligations, (y) infringement, dilution,
misappropriation or other violation of IP Rights, or (z) alleged or actual
hazard or defect in design, manufacture, materials or workmanship, including
any failure to warn or alleged or actual breach of express or implied warranty
or representation, in each case with respect to a unit of Product inserted in
a patient on or before the Closing Date.

 



25 (a) If Seller desires Claim Services for a Seller Product Claim, Seller shall
request those Claim Services by written notice to Buyer (a " __Service
Request __"). Seller shall in its Service Request designate a primary contact
person at Seller for Claim Services related to that Seller Product Claim.
Buyer and Seller each may, from time to time, by written notice to the other,
designate contact persons for Service Requests and other communications
concerning Claim Services who differ from their contact persons for other
notices under this Agreement.

 

(b) The Claim Services for each Seller Product Claim shall, as and to the
extent requested by the Seller, include the following services, each to the
extent commercially reasonable:

(i) Commercial management, coordination and oversight services related to
the administration, evaluation and defense of the Seller Product Claim,
including working with Seller or its Affiliates, Sellers insurers (if any),
and any Advisors to (A) review the Seller Product Claim, (B) evaluate the
Seller Product Claim, (C) develop a strategy for responding to the Seller
Product Claim, including through negotiation, mediation, litigation and
arbitration, (D) execute that strategy and (E) reevaluate and modify that
strategy as appropriate; and/or

(ii) Support from Buyer personnel with regulatory and technical expertise
concerning the Product in connection with the evaluation and defense of the
Seller Product Claim to include cooperation in claims or lawsuits including
reviewing and responding to allegations in pleadings, motions, or briefs;
response to document and other discovery requests; preparation for and
appearance at depositions, hearings or trial; consultation with expert
witnesses and other claim or litigation related activities as Buyer believes
are reasonably necessary to evaluate and defend Seller Product Claims.

 

(c) "Advisors" means consultants and legal, accounting and other professional
advisors, including expert witnesses, involved in the response to a Seller
Product Claim or otherwise involved in the Claim Services. Seller or its
insurers may designate Advisors. Buyer may, and shall at Sellers request,
designate Advisors, provided that the services provided by Advisors
designated by Buyer on its own initiative do not unreasonably duplicate
services provided by the Advisors designated by Seller or its insurers. To
help avoid duplication of services, Buyer shall notify Seller prior to
engaging Advisors. 

(d) Each Service Request shall describe in reasonable detail, to the extent
known by Seller at the time of delivery of the Service Request, the Seller
Product Claim for which Seller is requesting Claim Services and the Claim
Services requested by Seller. Seller may, by written notice to Buyer from time
to time, discontinue or change the scope of the Claim Services that Buyer
is providing with respect to any Seller Product Claim.

(e) The Claim Services shall be subject to the reasonable oversight and
direction of Seller in all respects, subject to compliance with applicable
law and regulation. Seller shall have the right to approve, or establish
limitations on, the settlement of each Seller Product Claim in Sellers
discretion.

 

(f) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Buyer in the course of providing the Claim Services, including
all fees and expenses of all Advisors. Buyer will invoice Seller monthly for
those expenses, and Seller shall pay those expenses to Buyer, by wire transfer
of immediately available U.S. dollars or other means acceptable to Buyer,
within 30 days of the date of Buyers invoice.

(g) The Claim Services may, to the extent requested by Seller, include
commercial oversight of providers of legal, accounting or other professional
services, but the Claim Services will not include legal, accounting or other
professional services.

 



26 (h) Buyer shall make personnel or Advisors with the requisite expertise
reasonably available to provide the Claim Services.

(i) Seller shall cooperate reasonably with Buyers performance of the Claim
Services, including promptly informing Buyer of developments in the Seller
Product Claims for which Buyer is providing Claim Services and providing
relevant information reasonably requested by Buyer.

 

(j) Seller Product Claims are Excluded Liabilities, for which neither Buyer
nor its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation, and nothing in
this _Section 4.17_, nor the performance of any Claim Services by Buyer or
its Affiliates, shall result in the imposition of any liability or obligation
on Buyer or its Affiliates arising from, concerning or in connection with any
Seller Product Claim. Buyers indemnification rights under _Section 8.2_
shall apply to all Seller Product Claims.

(k) BUYER CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCE CONCERNING THE OUTCOME OF ANY SELLER
PRODUCT CLAIM, AND SELLER HEREBY ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SUCH
OUTCOME. BUYER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONCERNING
THE CLAIM SERVICES, AND BUYER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
SELLER PRODUCT CLAIM OR THE OUTCOME OF ANY SELLER PRODUCT CLAIM.

(l) Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees
from and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, all Losses
arising from or relating to the Claim Services.

 

Section 4.18 _Financial Statements_. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
unaudited financial information of the Business, including income statements
for the relevant period and balance sheets as of the last day of the relevant
period, prepared on a basis consistent with the assumptions and basis of
presentation of the special purpose financial statements for the Business for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 that were audited and
delivered to Buyer on September 1, 2017 (the "Audited Financials"), for (1)
each of Sellers 2017 fiscal quarters that ended prior to the Closing Date
(the "Quarterly Financials") and (2) the period beginning on the day after the
last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter and ending on the Closing
Date (the "Stub Period Financials"). Seller shall deliver the Quarterly
Financials no later than January 31, 2018; provided, however, that if the
Closing Date is on or after December 31, 2017, Seller shall deliver the
financial information for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017 no later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall deliver the Stub
Period Financials (y) if the Closing Date is on or before October 31, 2017, no
later than December 11, 2017, or (z) if the Closing Date is after October 31,
2017, no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. Subject to the
other provisions of this _Section 4.18_, Seller shall provide such financial
statements and information (audited or unaudited, as the case may be) related
to the pre-Closing Business, at such times, as Buyer reasonably requires to
timely comply with its obligations under Rules 3-05 and 1-02(w) of Regulation
S-X and cooperate reasonably with Buyer in connection with those statements
and information. Buyer shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with fulfilling their obligations in this _Section 4.18_. Prior
to making any application to the SEC requesting that the SEC not object to
Buyer providing abbreviated financial statements of the Business (in the form
of the Audited Financials) in satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 3-05
of Regulation S-X (the "Waiver Request"), Buyer shall provide Seller and its
counsel with a copy of the draft Waiver Request and three (3) Business Days to
provide comments thereon, and shall give due consideration to any such
comments prior to submitting the Waiver Request.

 



27 Section 4.19 _Environmental Report_. Seller shall, on or before the Closing
Date, authorize ERM Consulting and Engineering, Inc. ("ERM") to permit Buyer to
rely on the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Owned Real Property,
dated August 30, 2017, prepared by ERM, and hereby authorizes Buyer to
make such arrangements with ERM as are required for that reliance, at Buyers
expense.

Section 4.20 _Trademarks and Domain Names_. Without limiting the generality
of Sellers obligations under _Section 4.1_, from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain the Trademarks and domain
names included in the Transferred Assets and pay all associated fees and
expenses. Seller shall, on or before the Closing Date, to the extent it has
not already done so, for each Trademark included in the Transferred Assets
that is owned by Teva Womens Health LLC, duly record with the applicable
Governmental Authorities with which that Trademark is registered the change in
that entitys name resulting from its conversion from a corporation to a
limited liability company.

 

ARTICLE 5

TAX MATTERS

Section 5.1 _Tax Allocation_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, gains or receipts, sales or use, employment, withholding or similar
items, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days from the beginning of such Straddle Period through the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains
or receipts, sales or use, employment, withholding or similar items, be
deemed equal to the amount of Tax which would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period
shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with past practice. Any Tax
refunds or credits for overpayment for a Straddle Period shall be determined
in a manner consistent with this  _Section 5.1_, and any such amounts that
relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or are otherwise described in _Annex
9.1(b)(x)_) shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates, to promptly remit to Seller the amount of any such refund or
credit (or any other amounts described in _Annex 9.1(b)(x)_).

Section 5.2  _Miscellaneous_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall provide the
other with such information and records, and make such of its officers,
directors, employees and agents available, as may reasonably be requested by
such other party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or the
conduct of any Tax Proceeding of the Transferred Assets or the Business for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period.

to the Closing Date:

 

(a) by the written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller by notice to the other party, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before January 1, 2018
(the "End Date"); provided, that in the event the condition set forth in
_Section 6.1(b)_ shall not have been satisfied on or prior to the End Date,
but all other conditions set forth in _Article 6_ shall have been satisfied,
or are capable of being satisfied (or have been waived by the party then
entitled to give such waiver) on or prior to the End Date, then the End Date
shall be extended without further action by the parties hereto to January 31,
2018; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party

Closing to be consummated by such time; or

 

(ii) (A) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Closing illegal
or otherwise prohibited or (B) any judgment, injunction, order or decree of
any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction enjoining Buyer or
Seller from consummating the Closing is entered and such judgment, injunction,
order or decree shall have become final and nonappealable;

(c) by Buyer by notice to Seller, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Seller set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach
is incapable of being cured by the End Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)_ if Buyer is then in material breach or violation of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; or

30 ARTICLE 8

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Survival_. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 2.16_, which shall not survive the Closing, all
representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date;
_provided_ that the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
_Sections 2.1_ (Organization), _2.2(a)_ (Authority) and _2.17_ (Finders Fees)
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations"), the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in  _Section 2.18_ (No Other Representations
and Warranties), and the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
_Sections 3.1_ (Corporate Status), _3.2(a)_ (Authority), _3.7_ (Finders Fees)
and _3.9_ (No Additional Representations; Inspection) shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The respective covenants
and agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement required to be
performed or complied with prior to the Closing (each, a "Pre-Closing
Covenant") shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Closing Date, and all other respective covenants and agreements of
Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement (each, a "Post-Closing
Covenant"), as well as Pre-Closing Covenants to the extent they contemplate
performance following the Closing, shall survive the Closing Date hereunder
indefinitely or for such lesser period of time as may be specified therein,
but not to exceed the applicable statute of limitations in the event of a
breach of such covenant or other agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as set forth in _Section 7.2_, no representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made in this Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

Section 8.2  _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing, and
subject to this _Article 8_ , Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer, and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer
Indemnitees for all Losses resulting from (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty by Seller in or pursuant to this Agreement,
(b) any breach or default in performance by Seller of any Pre-Closing Covenant
of Seller, (c) any breach or default in performance by Seller of any Post-
Closing Covenant of Seller or (d) any Excluded Liability. Notwithstanding
that a claim for Losses may fall into multiple categories of this _Section
8.2_, Buyer Indemnitees may recover such Losses only one time.

 

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, and
subject to this _Article 8_ , Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or reimburse the Seller
Indemnitees for, any and all Losses resulting from (a) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty by Buyer in or pursuant to this
Agreement, (b) any breach or default in performance by Buyer of any Pre-
Closing Covenant of Buyer or any Post-Closing Covenant of Buyer, (c) the
ownership and operation of the Transferred Assets and the Business after the
Closing and (d) the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding that a claim for
Losses may fall into multiple categories of this _Section 8.3_, Seller
Indemnitees may recover such Losses only one time.

 



31 Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnity_. Buyer and Seller agree, for themselves
and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees that:

(a) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under  _Section
8.2(a)_ in respect of any Loss incurred or suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee
until such time as the aggregate of all Losses that Buyer Indemnitees may have
under _Section 8.2(a)_ exceeds $5,500,000 (the "Indemnity Threshold"), and
then only for the aggregate amount of all Losses in excess of the Indemnity
Threshold. The aggregate liability of Seller in respect of claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ will not exceed $55,000,000
(the "Cap"). The Cap shall not apply to Losses under _Section 8.2(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the provisions of
this _Section 8.4(a)_ will not apply in respect of claims for breach of any
Fundamental Representation; _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate
liability of Seller in respect of claims for indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement exceed the Purchase Price actually received by Seller.

(b) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification, to sue for
damages or to assert any other right or remedy under this Agreement with
respect to any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it (i) is a
potential Loss that may be asserted rather than an actual Loss that has, in
fact, been incurred by such party or (ii) is a Loss with respect to which
such party or any of its Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be
taken) to accelerate the time period in which such matter is asserted or
payable.

 

(c) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover any amount relating to
any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent such
Buyer Indemnitee has already recovered such amount with respect to such matter
pursuant to such provision or any other provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement: (i)
each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis; (ii) all
Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds; (iii) in no event
shall an Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for any
special, incidental, indirect, speculative, treble or punitive damages, loss
of business reputation or opportunity, lost revenue, income or profits,
diminution in value or similar items, except if and to the extent any such
damages are recovered against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party
Claim; and (iv) the parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(e) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party may
be covered, in whole or in part, by third-party insurance coverage, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party so requests, the Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount of insurance
proceeds thereunder, in which event all such proceeds actually received, net
of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such
collection, shall be considered "Eligible Insurance Proceeds". In any case
where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third party any Eligible Insurance
Proceeds and/or any other amount in respect of any Losses for which an
Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed such Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Article 8_ , such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party such Eligible Insurance Proceeds and/or the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it
in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the
Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter.

 

(f) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or  _8.3_ and the
Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted
against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of
its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to
permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the
amount of such payment.

 



32 (g) Seller shall have no liability or obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee with respect to the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, based on any facts or circumstances that were
reasonably knowable to such Buyer Indemnitee by reason of relevant information
having been posted to the Data Room or otherwise provided to such Buyer
Indemnitee by or on behalf of Seller.

(h) Any Indemnified Party shall take all commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate any Losses incurred by such party upon and after becoming aware
of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any indemnification rights hereunder.

 

Section 8.5 _Notification of Claims; Third Party Claims_.

such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _Article 8_ , describing
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this  _Article 8_ except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure. The parties agree that (i) in this
_Article 8_ they intend to shorten (in the case of the limited survival

period with respect to certain claims, (ii) notices for claims in respect of a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (other than a

pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ in respect of a pending or threatened claim or
demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or
could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement
(such claim or demand being a "Third Party Claim" and including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party), the Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within 20 Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim, assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim, with its own
counsel and at its own expense, but shall allow the Indemnified Party
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party may
take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim prior
to the time that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party as
contemplated by the preceding sentence. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement, compromise or discharge does not involve any finding or admission
of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts
arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness
of such settlement, (ii) not encumber any of the material assets of any
Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to
or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party and (iii) obtain, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from any and all liability

 



33  in respect of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
claim or demand for which it is seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying
Party or admit to any liability with respect to such claim or demand without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which the Indemnifying
Party shall not unreasonably withhold or delay if it has not assumed the
defense of such claim or demand.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 8_ (including 
_Sections 8.2_ and _8.3_ ), no Indemnifying Party shall have any liability
under this _Article 8_ for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any
Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying Party.

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives notice of a claim
for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days following its receipt of such notice
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party under this _Article 8_. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any such
claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party.

Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that following the Closing,
subject to _Section 10.9_, the sole and exclusive remedy of a party for any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement shall be the indemnification rights set forth in
_Article 5_ and this _Article 8_ , regardless of the legal theory under which
any liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise. In
furtherance of the foregoing and subject to _Section 10.9_ and the
indemnification provisions set forth in _Article 5_ and this _Article 8_ , (a)
Buyer hereby waives, from and after the Closing Date, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action any Buyer Indemnitee may have against Seller or
any of its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives, successors
or assigns and (b) Seller hereby waives, from and after the Closing Date, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action any Seller Indemnitee may have
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or representatives, successors or
assigns, in either case to the extent such rights, claims and causes of action
relate to this Agreement and arise under or are based upon any Federal, state,
provincial, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise. The parties hereto agree that the provisions of this Agreement
relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyers and the Buyer
Indemnitees rights and remedies with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including this _Article 8_ ) were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to
Seller hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission
they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

that all claims in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby, or with respect to any such action or proceeding, shall be heard and
determined in such a New York State or federal court, and that
such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto shall be exclusive,
except solely to the extent that all such courts shall lawfully decline to
exercise such jurisdiction. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby waives, and agrees
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or in respect of any such transaction,
that it is not subject to such jurisdiction. Each of Buyer and Seller hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, to the maximum extent permitted by law, as
a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or in respect of any such transaction, that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts
or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such courts. Buyer and Seller hereby consent to and
grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over
the subject matter of any such dispute and agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner

jurisdiction as it may deem appropriate to enforce its rights hereunder and
each party hereby consents to each such applicable jurisdiction for purposes
of equitable relief pursuant to _Section 10.9_.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(c) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY
CLAIM OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECULATIVE, TREBLE OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR OPPORTUNITY, LOST REVENUE, INCOME OR
PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR SIMILAR ITEMS FROM THE OTHER PARTY HERETO (OR
ANY AFFILIATE OF SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO), EXCEPT THAT THE COURT SHALL HAVE

UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAIVER DOES NOT COVER ANY RIGHT TO INDEMNITY
FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOST
PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR SIMILAR ITEMS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES THAT
MAY BE IMPOSED OR OTHERWISE INCURRED).

 

(d) Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation of any of the parties
under this Agreement shall be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts

expressly waive or disclaim, as the case may be, any right or obligation they
may have under this Agreement pursuant to the U.N. Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods.

Section 10.5 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that neither party to this
Agreement may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
including by sale of stock, operation of Law in connection with a merger or
sale of substantially all the assets, without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that (i) Seller may, without such consent, assign its
rights to, or have its obligations discharged by, an Affiliate and (ii) Buyer
may, without such consent,

 



46  assign its rights to acquire the Transferred Assets and assume the Assumed
Liabilities hereunder, in whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment by Buyer or Seller shall
relieve Buyer or Seller of any of its obligations hereunder. An assignment to
an Affiliate of Buyer permitted under _Section 10.5(ii)_ shall be deemed null
and void as of the time of the assignment if, following such assignment such
Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate of Buyer. Any attempted assignment or
transfer in violation of this _Section 10.5_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
(when executed and delivered) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
representations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to

Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any provision, including any phrase, sentence,
clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable for any
reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such
provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case
or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein contained invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Upon any such
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as

hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Section 10.8 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Except as provided under _Article 8_ , no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
specified in _Section 10.4_, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and the
posting of any bond or other security in connection therewith.

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Conflicts; Deal Communications_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin Procter
LLP ("Goodwin") has acted as counsel to Seller (together with the Affiliates
of Seller, collectively, the "Seller Parties") in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Buyer hereby consents and agrees to Goodwin representing any of the Seller
Parties after the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the
interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Buyer and its
Affiliates, and even though Goodwin may have represented a Seller Party in a
matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Seller. Buyer further consents and agrees to the communication by
Goodwin to the Seller Parties in connection with any such representation of
any fact known to Goodwin arising by reason of Goodwins prior representation
of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



47 (c) In connection with the foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert any conflict of interest arising from or in connection
with: (i) Goodwins prior representation of Seller or any of its Affiliates
and (ii) Goodwins representation of the Seller Parties prior to and after the
Closing.

 

(d) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that all
communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among any of
Goodwin and/or any Seller Party, or any of their respective managers,
directors, officers employees or other representatives that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and
owned collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by Seller on
behalf of the Seller Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client
privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain privileged
after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence
relating thereto shall belong solely to the Seller Parties, shall be
controlled by Seller on behalf of the Seller Parties and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. 

__(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer, on the one hand, and a third party other than a Seller Party,
on the other hand, Buyer may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
_provided_ , that Buyer may not waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Seller, which Seller shall not unreasonably withhold
or delay. In the event that Buyer is legally required by governmental order or
otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Deal
Communications, Buyer shall immediately (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) notify Seller in writing (including by making specific
reference to this Section) so that Seller can seek a protective order and
Buyer agrees at the request and expense of Seller to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to assist therewith. __

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by
Goodwin constitute property of its clients, only the Seller Parties shall
hold such property rights and Goodwin shall have no duty to reveal or disclose
any such files or other materials or any Deal Communications by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Goodwin and any Seller Party.

(g) Buyer agrees that it will not (i) access or use the Deal Communications,
including by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other
information, or by seeking to have any Seller Party waive the attorney-client
or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Buyer has the right to
waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the Deal
Communications from Goodwin. In furtherance of the foregoing, it shall not be
a breach of any provision of this Agreement if prior to the Closing any Seller
Party, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or other
representatives takes any action to protect from access or remove from any
Transferred Asset or the premises of the Business (or any offsite back-up or
other facilities) any Deal Communications, including without limitation by
segregating, encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting or otherwise
taking possession of any Deal Communications (any such action, a "Permitted
Removal"). In the event that, notwithstanding any good faith attempts by any
Seller Party, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other representatives to achieve a Permitted Removal of any Deal
Communication, any copy, backup, image, or other form or version or
electronic vestige of any portion of such Deal Communication remains
accessible to or discoverable or retrievable by Buyer (each, a "Residual

 



48  Communication"), Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees or other
representatives not to intentionally use or intentionally attempt to use any
means for the purpose of accessing, retrieving, restoring, recreating,
unarchiving or otherwise gaining access to or viewing any Residual
Communication.

 



49 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

   2. | THE SERVICES 
---|--- 



   2.1 | _Provision of the Services_ __. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Services_. In consideration of the payment of the Service
Charges and other amounts set forth herein, Provider shall provide or cause to
be provided the Services to Recipient in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Compliance with Applicable Law, etc_. Each Party shall
comply in all material respects at all times with all applicable Laws and
requirements and directions of applicable Governmental Authorities to the
extent relevant to the provision or receipt (as applicable to such Party) of
a Service. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | _Changes to Services_. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that the scope or characteristics of the Services may change in accordance
with the procedure set out in Clause 8.6(d) during the Term as
Recipient completes its transition from dependence on Provider for the
Services to operational independence. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event that any of the Services are reasonably required to be modified in terms
of content, manner of provision or otherwise (including the Service Charges
therefor) due to applicable Law or the requirements and directions of
applicable Governmental Authorities, including related to the Closing or the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to implement such modifications and will enter into an
amendment to this Agreement, including _Schedule_ __ _ 1_, to reflect such
modifications. 
---|---|--- 
 



   1  | Note to Draft: Workstreams to be completed once service schedules
are finalized. 
---|--- 
 



4 this Agreement, Recipient shall pay to Provider for each Service (i) the
Service Charge for that Service; (ii) all amounts payable under Third
Party Contracts to the extent applicable to the provision or receipt of the
Services plus a handling fee of the Handling Fee Percentage of such amounts;
(iii) all other costs, expenses and other amounts incurred by Provider in
obtaining any equipment, hardware, software or services as part of the
provision of the Services; and (iv) all other amounts agreed to by the Parties
in writing. The Parties acknowledge that the Service Charges are based on the
total costs incurred by Teva in providing such Service prior to both the
Closing and the separation of the Business from the Retained Business. The
Parties agree that in the event that Providers total costs of providing all
of the Services in the aggregate or any Service individually over the
preceding three (3) months exceeds the aggregate Service Charge for Services
or the individual Service Charge for such Service, as applicable, over such
period by the Service Charge Percentage or more, a Party may refer such
shortfall to the TSA Steering Committee for a prompt, good faith adjustment to
the relevant Service Charge on a going-forward basis, along with a one-time
true-up payment from Recipient to enable Provider to recoup its shortfall
relating to the time period at issue. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | _Consents_. It is the understanding of the Parties that,
except as set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 2.3_ of the Purchase Agreement, any
waivers, permits, consents or similar approvals from any third parties
(including Third Party Suppliers) or Governmental Authorities (any such
waiver, permit, consent or similar approval being, a "Consent") that are
necessary for Provider to perform or Recipient to receive the Services
have been obtained prior to the Effective Date. If any Consent has not been
obtained prior to the Effective Date or has been so obtained but is later
terminated or revoked by such Third Party or Governmental Authority, the
Parties shall work together in good faith to obtain or achieve the
reinstatement of such Consent or to agree upon a commercially reasonable
alternative arrangement in respect of such Service to the maximum extent
possible; provided, however, that, pending obtaining or
achieving reinstatement of such Consent or agreement on such alternative
arrangement, Provider shall (subject to Clause 2.1(b)), for a period not to
exceed three (3) months, use commercially reasonable efforts to implement
reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide Recipient with the
benefits of such Service as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained;
provided, further, that any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by either
Party in connection with obtaining or achieving the reinstatement of such
Consent, or the implementation of any such alternative arrangement with
respect to any such Consent not obtained prior to the Effective Date shall be
borne by Recipient. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | _Third Party Contracts_. Recipient agrees to comply with
the terms of all Third Party Contracts. In the event Provider passes on to
Recipient the benefit of any remedies (including any applicable service
level credits), warranties, representations, indemnities and undertakings
given in such Third Party Contract and such pass through of benefits results
in any costs to Provider, such costs shall be added to the Service Charge for
such Service and itemized on the relevant invoice(s) in accordance with
Clause 3.1(a). 
---|---|--- 
 



5 transitional nature of the Services. Accordingly, as promptly as practicable
following the date hereof, Recipient agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to make a transition of each Service to its own internal organization
or to obtain alternative third-party sources to provide the Services and in
each case in accordance with the Transition Plan. Provider and Recipient each
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective such transition of Services in
accordance with this Agreement. If requested by Recipient, Provider shall,
for a period not to exceed three (3) months, assist, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third-party provider of Services
to assist, Recipient in connection with the transition of the performance of
Services by Provider to the performance of such Services by Recipient, which
may include reasonable assistance with the transfer of records, migration of
historical data, the transition of any such Service from the systems of
Provider to the systems of Recipient and cooperation with and assistance to
any third-party consultants engaged by Recipient in connection with such
transition. To the extent that, at the expiry of the Term, Recipient will
require an agreement with any third-party provider used by Provider to
provide Services, Provider will, for a period not to exceed three (3) months,
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Recipient to obtain terms and
conditions, including pricing terms, substantially similar to those received
from such service providers by Provider or an Affiliate of Provider prior to
the Effective Date for Recipients benefit, taking into account the need to
minimize the cost of such migration and the disruption to the ongoing
business activities of the Parties and their Affiliates; provided, however, if
Recipient is unable to obtain equivalent terms and conditions, such inability
shall not require Provider to provide the Services following expiry of the
Term. Recipient shall also be responsible for any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Provider in rendering all such assistance. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) | _Excused Performance_. To the extent that Provider is
prevented from or delayed in providing or causing the provision of any Service
by any act or failure to act of Recipient or any Affiliate of Recipient,
Provider shall promptly notify Recipients SteerCo Lead in writing in
reasonable detail and shall not be liable for such prevention from or delay in
the provision of the affected Service. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.2 | _Omitted Service_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement,
the Buyer discovers any Omitted Service, the Buyer may notify the Seller of
the Omitted Service and request that the Seller provide the Omitted Service
as an additional Service under this Agreement. Such notice shall include
Buyers requested duration for each such Omitted Service. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Within seven Business Days of receiving that notice, the
Seller shall notify the Buyer of the amount of the Service Charge and all
other amounts contemplated in Clause 2.1(d), which shall be determined
as contemplated in Clause 2.1(d), for Seller or a Seller Affiliate to provide
the Omitted Service and Sellers proposed duration for each such 
---|---|--- 
 



6 Sellers notice within five Business Days of receiving it, the Buyer shall be
deemed to have elected not to receive that service. If the Buyer notifies the
Seller within that five Business Day period that it wants the Seller to
provide the Omitted Service, then: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | Schedule 1 shall be amended to add the Omitted Service and
corresponding Service Charge and other fees and Service Term; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Seller shall provide the Omitted Service to the Buyer
as soon as reasonably practicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Buyer shall pay the Seller or a Seller Affiliate for the
Omitted Service the Service Charge and other amounts for that Omitted Service
determined consistent with Clause 2.1(d), including the amounts quoted by the
Seller in the Sellers notice. 
---|---|--- 



   2.3 | _Cooperation_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, Provider and Recipient agree to reasonably cooperate with each
other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Services.
Subject to Clause 2.4, each Party shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, make available on a timely basis to the other Party all
information and materials requested by the other Party to the extent
reasonably necessary for the purposes of providing and receiving the Services
in accordance with this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 



   2.4 | _Facilities and Access to Facilities_. To the extent that the
performance or receipt of Services requires either Party or its Affiliates, or
on their behalf designees or subcontractors not reasonably objected to by the
controlling Party, to have access to the controlling Partys Facilities during
the Term: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Party which owns or controls such Facility shall permit
or shall cause its relevant Affiliate which owns or controls such Facility to
permit (for the purposes of this Clause 2.3 the "controlling Party") the
other Party or its relevant Affiliate, designee or subcontractor (for the
purposes of this Clause 2.3 the "accessing Party") to access and use the
relevant Facility, to the extent reasonably necessary to provide or receive
the Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (for the purposes
of this Clause 2.3 "Access"), during Working Hours and at such other times as
are reasonably required, to the extent permitted by the controlling Partys
leases, to the extent affecting or relating to the Facilities and as
communicated to the accessing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where
required by a Governmental Authority, each Party shall give the other Party
or representatives of the relevant Governmental Authority access to the
relevant premises in the manner and to the extent required by the relevant
Governmental Authority; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | controlling Party may reasonably refuse to admit to its
Facilities any employee or other personnel of accessing Party whose admission
would, at the sole discretion of controlling Party cause (or be reasonably
likely to cause) (i) a security and/or health and safety risk; or (ii) the
controlling Party to be in breach of applicable Law; and 
---|---|--- 
 



7 Access such Facilities in accordance with all applicable Laws, the directions
of any Governmental Authority, the terms and conditions of the
controlling Partys leases affecting or relating to the Facilities as the
terms of any such leases are communicated in writing or have otherwise been
made accessible to the accessing Party in advance to accessing Party,
controlling Partys policies and procedures as such policies and procedures
are communicated in writing or have otherwise been made accessible in advance
to accessing Party from time to time and controlling Partys reasonable
directions from time to time (including directions relating to security and
health and safety) and shall keep the Facilities in good order and not commit
or permit waste or damage to the same, shall not make any changes or
improvements to the Facilities without controlling Partys prior written
consent and shall permit controlling Party and its employees, agents and
representatives to enter the Facilities at any time and for any purpose. 
---|---|--- 



   2.5 | _Security_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Access to Required Technology_. To the extent that the
performance of Services requires Provider to have access to Recipients
internal IT systems (including third-Person services, e-mail and access to
computer networks, database and equipment) owned, licensed, leased or used by
Recipient ("Required Technology"), Recipient shall provide reasonable access
to such Required Technology in accordance with applicable Law and subject to
the security, use, virus protection, disaster recovery and confidentiality
policies and procedures (including physical security, network and system
access, internet security, confidentiality and processing of Personal Data
and security guidelines and procedures) in effect by Recipient with respect to
its own internal IT systems as of the date hereof. Provider shall, and shall
cause its personnel having access to the Required Technology to (i) comply
with all of Recipients security policies that are applicable to the provision
of any Service or access to any Facility, networks and systems; (ii) not
tamper with, compromise or circumvent any security or audit measures employed
by Recipient whose Required Technology is being accessed; and (iii) ensure
that only those users who are specifically authorized by Recipient gain access
to the Required Technology. The rights of access to the Required Technology
granted hereunder shall be restricted to user access only, and shall not
include privileged or higher level access rights or rights to functionality.
Other than as specifically permitted under this Agreement, no Person
shall have any rights of access to the other Partys Required Technology or
internal IT systems. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Erroneous Data Transfer_. To the extent that Provider
transfers, provides, or allows Recipient to access any data (including any
Personal Data, test results, RandD laboratory information assets,
financial information, clinical data, business and sales data, adverse event
data, customer data, new product information, manufacturing information and
documentation, investigation information, batch records, human resources
information, government pricing, dossier information, regulatory information
or information relating to data) 
---|---|--- 
 



8 accessible to Recipient either due to an error by Provider or because such
data was not or could not reasonably be separated or otherwise removed from
any data or database to which Recipient was being provided access in order to
receive the Services ("Erroneously Transferred Data"), then following the
earlier of (i) the date that Recipient receives written notice of such
Erroneously Transferred Data; or (ii) the date it becomes reasonably apparent
to Recipient that it has been transferred, received or been provided access to
such Erroneously Transferred Data, Recipient shall (A) treat such Erroneously
Transferred Data as Information for purposes of Clause 8.3; (B) not use or
disclose such Erroneously Transferred Data for any purpose; and (C) promptly,
at Providers request, subject to any automatic electronic archiving system,
delete such Erroneously Transferred Data and/or, at Providers discretion,
provide a copy of such Erroneously Transferred Data to Provider in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Provider. 
---|--- 
 



   2.6 | _Service Quality_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | _Service Level_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, Provider shall itself or through its subcontractors use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services with a standard of
care and skill and in a manner and quality which is in no event inferior to
the manner and quality in which services equivalent to such Services were
provided to the Business or performed during the Reference Period, except as
may otherwise be expressly provided in Schedule 1. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | _Independent Contractor Status_. Provider shall act under
this Agreement solely as an independent contractor and not as an agent,
employee or joint venture counterparty of Recipient. All employees
and representatives of Provider or its subcontractors providing the Services
shall be under the direction, control and supervision of Provider (and not of
Recipient), and Provider shall have the sole right to exercise all authority
with respect to such employees and representatives and in no event shall such
employees and representatives be deemed to be employees or agents of
Recipient. Neither Party shall bind, or attempt to bind, the other Party
hereto to any contract or the performance of any other obligation, or
represent to any third Person that it is authorized to enter into any contract
or binding obligation on behalf of the other Party hereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | _Uses of Services_. Recipient shall not resell any Services
to any Person (other than an Affiliate) whatsoever or permit the use of any
Services by any Person (other than an Affiliate) other than in connection
with Recipients operation of the Business in substantially the same manner
as conducted during the Reference Period. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | _No Violation of Laws_. Neither Provider nor any Third
Party service providers shall be required to provide all or any part of any
particular Service to the extent that providing such Service, according to
written advice of counsel, would require Provider to violate any applicable
Laws. In such case, Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange for an alternative method of delivering such Service that does not
violate any applicable Laws and that effectuates the intent of this Agreement
with respect to such Service to the maximum extent possible under applicable
Law. Recipient shall bear the costs for such alternative methods. 
---|---|--- 
 



9 Affiliates or Third Parties as a subcontractor for the purpose of performing
some or all of the Services hereunder. 
---|--- 
 



   2.8 | _No Legal, Tax or Other Advice_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in _Schedule_ __ _ 1_, Recipient acknowledges that any
input or information provided by Provider in connection with the Services
does not constitute accounting, tax, legal, compliance or risk management
advice. 
---|--- 



   3. | CHARGES, INVOICING AND PAYMENT 
---|--- 



   3.1 | _Payment_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Recipient shall pay Provider the Service Charges and all
other amounts set forth in Clause 2.1(d) in accordance with this Agreement for
all Services actually provided pursuant to this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 1_ (i) Provider shall
invoice Recipient or its nominated Affiliate on a monthly basis in arrears for
the Service Charges and all other applicable amounts attributable to Services
provided during the preceding month, with such invoice being sent by Provider
to Recipient no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the first (1st)
Business Day of the month immediately following such preceding month; (ii)
each such invoice shall set forth in reasonable detail a description of such
Services and the Service Charge and other applicable amounts therefor and
shall be payable in the currency of such Service Charge as set forth on
_Schedule_ __ _ 1_, by bank transfer within thirty (30) days following the
date of receipt by Recipient or Recipients nominated Affiliate; and (iii)
subject to Clause 3.1(b), any amount not paid by the thirtieth (30th) day
after Recipient or Recipients nominated Affiliates receipt of such invoice
shall be subject to late charges at the rate of One-Year LIBOR (as published
in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, on the due date) plus two percent
(2%) from the due date until the date on which such amount is paid.
Additionally, if any undisputed amount of an invoice is not paid within ten
(10) Business Days after Recipient receives an additional notice from Provider
that Provider will suspend the Services if Recipient fails to pay that
undisputed amount, Provider may suspend the Services until that undisputed
amount and applicable late charges are paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Recipient may not deduct, set-off, counterclaim or otherwise
withhold any amount owed to it by Provider under this Agreement, the Purchase
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or other agreement (on account
of any obligation owed by Provider or any Affiliate of Provider, whether or
not such obligation has been finally adjudicated, settled or otherwise agreed
upon in writing) against the charges payable or against the expenses owed by
Recipient to Provider pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Recipient disputes in good faith
any amount on an invoice, Recipient shall notify Provider in writing within
ten (10) Business Days after Recipients or Recipients nominated Affiliates 
---|---|--- 
 



10 reason for disputing such amount, and will be entitled to withhold such amount
during the pendency of the dispute. The provisions of Clause 8.7 shall apply
with respect to any disputed amount. The Parties will use good faith efforts
to resolve any dispute regarding payments owed by Recipient as soon as
reasonably practicable. Upon resolution of the dispute, to the extent it is
resolved that Recipient still owes Provider some or all of the amount
withheld, it shall promptly pay such applicable amount to Provider, together
with any applicable interest payment calculated in accordance with Clause
3.1(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient shall timely pay all
undisputed portions of each invoice in the manner set forth in Clause 3.1(a). 
---|--- 



   3.2 | _Sales Taxes and Withholding Taxes_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Any Sales Taxes will be payable by Recipient to Provider in
accordance with Clause 3.1. The Service Charges do not include Sales Taxes,
which will be separately stated on the relevant and valid invoice to
Recipient to the extent required by applicable Law. Provider shall be
responsible for the remittance of all such Sales Taxes to the applicable Tax
Authority to the extent required by applicable Law. Provider or Providers
nominated Affiliate shall timely prepare and file all tax returns required to
be filed with any Tax Authority with respect to such Sales Taxes and, in the
case of value-added taxes, timely provide Recipient with valid value-added tax
invoices, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law. Recipient
shall cooperate with Provider in the preparation and filing of any such tax
returns and other documentation, in accordance with applicable Law. The
Parties and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate to eliminate
or minimize the amount of any such Sales Taxes imposed on the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. If Recipient provides Provider with a valid
and applicable exemption certificate, or other equivalent valid documentation
exempting Recipient from any such Sales Taxes, reasonably satisfactory to
Provider, then Provider shall to the extent permitted under applicable Law not
charge Recipient for such exempted Sales Taxes. Recipient is not responsible
for any penalties or interest related to the failure of Provider to collect
such Sales Taxes if not included on a valid invoice or the failure to remit
such Sales Taxes to the proper tax authority. If Provider receives a refund of
any Sales Taxes collected from Recipient, whether in the form of cash, credit
or other similar offset, Provider shall credit or refund the amount to
Recipient within a reasonable period of time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Any and all payments made hereunder, or otherwise for
Services provided pursuant hereto, shall be made without deduction of, for or
on account of withholding Taxes, except to the extent required by applicable
Law. If any applicable Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax
from any such payments, then Recipient or Provider, as applicable, shall be
entitled to withhold the required amounts and shall timely pay such withheld
amounts over to the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with the
requirements of applicable Law, and, except in the case of any Sales Tax
(which amount shall continue to be due and payable to Provider), any amount so
withheld and paid over shall be treated as having been paid to the other
Party, and Recipient or Provider, as applicable, shall not be required to pay
any additional amount as a result of or in respect of such withholding;
provided, that prior to making any deduction or withholding from any
payment under this Agreement, Recipient or Provider, as applicable, shall
provide reasonable prior written notice to Recipient or 
---|---|--- 
 



11 or withholding and provide to the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
furnish forms, certificates or other items that would reduce or eliminate
such deduction or withholding; provided, further, that the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate and assist one another to minimize any such deduction or
withholding. Each Party shall provide the other Party, as applicable, in a
timely manner, with documentation evidencing payment to the applicable Tax
Authority of any amounts so withheld and in the form and manner required by
applicable Law to allow the relevant Party to recover the amount withheld to
the extent allowable by applicable Law. If Recipient or Provider, as
applicable, receives a refund of any withheld taxes, whether in the form of
cash, credit or other similar offset, such Party shall credit or refund the
amount to the other Party within a reasonable period of time. 
---|--- 



   4. | FORCE MAJEURE 
---|--- 



   4.1 | _Excusing Performance_. Neither Party shall be liable for the
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such
failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing
Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages,
epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not),
terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or
other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the non-
performing Party or of any other Person), acts of government or regulatory
authorities, or acts of God (a "Force Majeure Event"). 
---|--- 



   4.2 | _Notice of Force Majeure Event_. A Party claiming a right to be
excused from performance under Clause 4.1 shall immediately notify the other
Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice
shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time
during which its performance will be affected. 
---|--- 



   4.3 | _Resumption_. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force
Majeure Event shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at its own expense,
to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance as soon as
practicable. 
---|--- 



   5. | PERSONNEL 
---|--- 



   5.1 | _No Secondment_. For the avoidance of doubt, Provider is not
under any obligation to second or procure the secondment to Recipient of any
employee or other personnel in connection with the provision of the Services.
The Parties agree that such individuals providing Services are employees,
contract employees or secondees of the Provider or its respective Affiliates. 
---|--- 



    5.2 | _Application of the Transfer Regulations_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that they do not expect the Transfer Regulations to
apply to the commencement, provision or termination of all or any of the
Services of this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



12 ---|--- 



   6.1 | _Exclusions from Liability_. EXCEPT TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION
UNDER CLAUSE 6.3 WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, AND EXCEPT IN CASES OF
FRAUD OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES OR BREACH OF CLAUSE
8.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THE AFFILIATES OF SUCH PARTY BE LIABLE
TO THE OTHER FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, MULTIPLE, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR INCOME,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ANY
ACTIVITIES OR NON-PERFORMANCE HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ARISING FROM
BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
SUCH PARTY IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE OR IF SUCH
LOSS OR DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN.

or willful misconduct by Provider or any of its Affiliates, and any of its
and their respective shareholders, owners, officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives, in each case related to the provision of or

Agreement, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) subject to
Clause 6.2 and except to the extent of those Losses which Recipient has an
obligation to indemnify pursuant to Clause 6.3(a), as to which Losses each
Party shall indemnify the other to the extent of its liability for such
Losses. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | No right of indemnification shall exist under the Purchase

the provisions of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Either Party (the "Indemnitee") intending to claim
indemnification under this Clause 6.3 shall notify the other Party (the
"Indemnitor") promptly in writing of any action, claim or liability in
respect of which the Indemnitee believes it is entitled to claim
indemnification, provided that the failure to give timely notice to the

thirty (30) day period after the Indemnitors receipt of notice of any action
or claim with counsel of the Indemnitors choice and at the sole cost of the
Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor so assumes such defense, the indemnitee may
participate therein through counsel of its choice, but at the sole cost of
the indemnitee. The Party not assuming the defense of any such claim shall
render all reasonable assistance to the Party assuming such defense, and all

Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that
the Indemnitee shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any
such action or claim which imposes on the Indemnitee any liability or
obligation that cannot be assumed and performed in full by the Indemnitor,
and the Indemnitee shall have no right to withhold its consent to any
settlement of any such action or claim if the settlement involves only the
payment of money by the Indemnitor or its insurer and includes a full release
of claims with respect to the Indemnitee. 
---|---|--- 



   6.4 | _Representations_. Each Party represents and undertakes to the
other Party that as of the Effective Date (a) it has the capacity and
authority to enter into this Agreement; (b) the Persons entering into this
Agreement on its behalf have been duly authorized to do so; and (c) this

non-payment without cure thereof; and (c) either Party may immediately
terminate, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies such Party may
have, any one or more Services or this Agreement if any of the following

applicable), and such breach is either not capable of being cured or is not
cured within thirty (30) days after notice of breach is given by the non-
breaching Party; (ii) if the other Party commences a voluntary case or other

taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other
proceeding commenced against it, or makes a general assignment for

shall pay for any non-cancellable costs of third parties engaged by Provider
or other costs reasonably incurred by Provider as a result of the termination
or reduction of the relevant Service prior to the expiry of any Service Term
or Extended Term (provided that Provider shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize the existence and amount of any such liability or costs)
in connection with such Service and in accordance with this Agreement. Except
as set forth in this Clause 7.3, no such termination or reduction of any
Service will in any way affect Providers obligation to provide or make
available any other Service provided or required pursuant to this Agreement or
Recipients obligation to pay for the same, all in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Termination of a Service shall not relieve Provider from
any obligation hereunder to provide (or if applicable, to cause the provision
of) any remaining Services.

     | (a) | Prior to this Agreement and in the course of the provision
or receipt of Services, each Party may have disclosed or may need to disclose

this Agreement from the Disclosing Party, and it shall use all Information
received by it in connection with this Agreement from the Disclosing Party
solely as necessary for the provision or receipt of the Services (and for no
other purpose whatsoever) and it shall take the same degree of care with the
Disclosing Partys Information as it uses with its own, but in no event less

Information which is legally required and shall request assurance that the
Information will be accorded confidential treatment. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | The Receiving Party shall inform any and all of its
Affiliates, officers, directors, controlling persons, partners, employees,
agents or representatives ("Representatives") that receive Information of the
Disclosing Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of such
Information and shall direct such Representatives to treat such Information as
strictly proprietary and confidential. The Receiving Party shall establish

Provider hereby assigns, and causes the assignment by its Affiliate, to

Right and agrees to provide such assistance and execute such documents as
Recipient may reasonably request to vest in such Party all right, title and
interest in such IP Right.

effective transition of the Services to a relevant Party; (iii)

from time to time agree.  
---|---|---

Buyer SteerCo Lead 

    [ 🌑 ] |  | [ 🌑 ] 
 



     | (c) | The Teva SteerCo Lead and Buyer SteerCo Lead shall
coordinate meetings of the TSA Steering Committee from time to time. The TSA
Steering Committee shall meet on a monthly basis in such location as is
reasonably convenient to each Party (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
via audio or video conference) or otherwise as agreed between the Teva SteerCo
Lead and Buyer SteerCo Lead. The first TSA Steering Committee meeting shall

Service Term to the TSA Steering Committee for agreement by the TSA Steering
Committee. The TSA Steering Committee shall endeavor to make all decisions by
unanimous decision, provided that a decision between the Teva SteerCo Lead and
the Buyer SteerCo Lead shall constitute a decision of the TSA Steering
Committee. Either Party may from time to time and at its sole discretion,
replace any one or more of its representatives on the TSA Steering Committee
(including the Teva SteerCo Lead, the Buyer SteerCo Lead and/or
the Workstream Leads) with an appropriate individual, by giving notice of
replacement to the other Party, provided that the Parties shall use this right
sparingly so as not to disrupt the work of the TSA Steering Committee. 
---|---|---

existing Services; or (ii) increase the amount or scope of existing Services

Change shall be discussed at the next convened TSA Steering Committee. If the

along with any proposed changes to the relevant Service Charges or Service
Term to the SteerCo Leads for implementation. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8.7 | _Disputes_. Other than with respect to any claim covered by
Clause 6.3, any dispute, controversy or claim between the Parties arising out
of, relating to or in connection with the Services, this Agreement, or the
breach, termination, or validity thereof (a "Dispute"), shall be resolved by
submitting such Dispute in writing first to the relevant Workstream Lead of
each Party, and such Workstream Leads shall seek to resolve such
Dispute through informal good faith negotiation. In the event that such
Dispute is not resolved by the relevant Workstream Leads within five (5)
Business Days after the submission of such Dispute to such Workstream Leads,
the relevant Workstream Leads shall escalate such Dispute to the Teva SteerCo
Lead and the Buyer SteerCo Lead for resolution. In the event that such Dispute
is not resolved by the Teva SteerCo Lead and Buyer SteerCo Lead within five
(5) Business Days of such escalation (or such longer time as the SteerCo
Leads may agree), then the claiming Party may provide the other Party with a
written notice (a "Notice of Dispute"), describing (a) the issues in dispute
and such Partys position thereon; (b) a summary of the evidence and
arguments supporting such Partys

Party. The senior executives or their respective designees designated in such
Notice of Dispute shall meet in person or by telephone as often as reasonably
necessary to resolve the Dispute and shall confer in a good faith effort to
resolve the Dispute. In the event that such Dispute is not resolved by such
senior executives or their respective designees within five (5) Business Days

arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without

Parties under this Agreement shall be governed by the U.N. Convention on

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such New York State or Federal court and (d)

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to
Closing under the Purchase Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the premises above and in the Purchase Agreement, the
mutual covenants and considerations set forth hereinafter and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged and confirmed, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1\. Definitions. Capitalized terms which are not defined herein shall
have the meaning given in the Purchase Agreement. The following terms shall,
unless the context otherwise requires, have the following meanings,
respectively:

 

"Affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

 

"Business" shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

 

"License" means the license granted under Section 2.1.

 

"Licensed Marks" means the trademark registrations, applications for trademark
registration, and Internet domain name registrations, trademarks, service
marks, names, symbols, designations listed on _Exhibit A_ and any derivations
thereof in use by Licensor or any of its

 

  Affiliates in the Business during the twelve (12) month period prior to the

twelve (12) month period prior to the Effective Date.

"Products" means the products set forth in Schedule 1.3 of the Purchase
Agreement.

relating to use of the Licensed Marks communicated in writing to Licensee

publication or delivery of notice thereof to Licensee.

 

Section 2\. License

2.1. Grant. Subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, nontransferable
(except as provided in Section 7.2), nonsublicensable (except as provided in
Section 2.2), royalty-free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use and
display the Licensed Marks in connection with the operation of the Business
during the Term, but only to the extent (a) the Licensed Marks are used in or
displayed on the packaging, labeling or marketing materials printed on or
immediately prior to the Effective Date or printed after the Effective Date to
meet the requirements of the Business in the 6 months after the Effective
Date, or electronic media, including websites, used immediately prior to the
Effective Date, in connection with the Products, or (b) as necessary to
receive the services under the Transition Services Agreement, in each case,
in substantially the same manner in which they are in use by Licensor or its
Affiliates in connection with the operation of the Business on or immediately
prior to the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee may use the
Licensed Marks in connection or in combination with one or more other
trademarks as part of the transition from using the Licensed Marks to such
other marks designated by Licensee to identify the goods and service of
the Business; provided that Licensee otherwise has the right (e.g., by
ownership or license of such other trademarks) to legally use such other
trademarks in connection or in combination with the Licensed Marks.

 

2.2. Limited Right to Sublicense. Licensee may sublicense any of the rights
under the License to any of its Affiliates or to a third party upon prior
written consent of Licensor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), provided that the sublicense shall be set forth in a written
agreement including, without limitation, specific acknowledgement that: (a)
the sublicense is subject to all of the applicable terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement; (b) in its exercise of the sublicense, the
sublicensee shall comply with all of Licensees applicable obligations under
this Agreement; (c) the sublicensee has no right to grant any other person
any sublicense any right under the License; and (d) the sublicense shall
automatically terminate (e.g., without any notice or other action by Licensee
or Licensor) upon the earlier of the end of the Term or, if applicable, if
and when the sublicensee ceases to be an Affiliate of Licensee. Upon granting
any sublicense, Licensee shall give Licensor written notice thereof
(including, without limitation, the name and principal place of business of
the sublicensee and

 



2  the name, address and telephone number of the employee or other
representative of the sublicensee responsible for the sublicensees
administration of and compliance with the sublicense agreement). Upon
Licensors request, Licensee shall deliver to Licensor a true, correct and
complete copy of any sublicense agreement (including, without limitation, any
and all amendments, supplements and modifications thereof), provided
that Licensee may redact any financial terms from such sublicense agreement.

2.3. Proper Use of Licensed Marks. Licensee shall use the Licensed Marks only
for the purpose set forth in Section 2.1, in substantially the same manner in
which they were in use by Licensor and its Affiliates in connection with their
operation of the Business on or immediately prior to the Effective Date and
in accordance with this Agreement and the Trademark Guidelines in all material
respects. Licensee shall ensure that any use of the Licensed Marks pursuant to
the License includes the trademark markings and notices (e.g.,  or ®) to the
extent required and set forth in the Trademark Guidelines to preserve all of
Licensors rights (including, without limitation, all remedies for
infringement) and interests with respect to the Licensed Marks. Licensee
shall ensure that all Products offered by Licensee or any of its Affiliates
under any of the Licensed Marks shall be of equal or better quality than the
same Products or substantially similar products and services offered by
Licensor and its Affiliates in the Business as conducted on the Effective
Date. Licensee shall not use any of the Licensed Marks: (a) for any purpose
other than as set forth in Section 2.1, including without limitation in
connection with the marketing, sale or promotion of any products or services
other than the Products; (b) in any manner that disparages Licensor, any of
Licensors Affiliates or any products or services offered by Licensor or any
of its Affiliates; (c) in any manner that injures the goodwill associated with
any of the Licensed Marks; or (d) in any manner that violates any law,
regulation, rule, order or other requirement of any governmental authority
having jurisdiction. Upon notice of or discovery of any noncompliance with the
requirements of this Section 2.3, Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of
the noncompliance, remedy the noncompliance and notify Licensor when
remedial action is taken.

2.4. Wind Down. Licensee shall take commercially reasonable steps to wind down
the use of the Licensed Marks in connection with the operation of the
Business during the Term and completely discontinue use of the Licensed Marks
by Licensee and its Affiliates as of the end of the Term.

 

2.5. Audit. If Licensor reasonably believes that Licensees or Licensees
Affiliates use of the Licensed Marks is not in compliance with the
requirements set forth in Section 2, then Licensor shall have the right to
audit such uses of the Licensed Marks by Licensee and its Affiliates. Upon
Licensors reasonable advance notice, Licensee shall provide Licensor access
from time to time during normal business hours to records and other
documentation evidencing such use of the Licensed Marks by Licensee and its
Affiliates (including, without limitation, all applicable advertising
and promotional materials bearing such Licensed Marks); provided, however,
that in no event shall Licensor exercise the rights granted under this Section
2.5 in a manner that interferes with the conduct of the Business in any
material respect.

 

2.6. Nominative; Fair Use. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent Licensee and its Affiliates from, during the Term and
after, using the Licensed Marks solely (a) in a non-trademark manner to
describe the history of the Business, including Licensees acquisition of the
Business; (b) as required by applicable law; or (c) in a manner consistent
with "trademark fair use" to the extent no consumer confusion is likely to
result from such use.

 



3 Section 3\. Ownership, Perfection, Maintenance and Enforcement

 

3.1. Ownership. Except as specifically set forth in the License, Licensor
reserves all rights in the Licensed Marks. No additional rights are granted
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. No title to or ownership of any of the
Licensed Marks is transferred to Licensee under this Agreement or by
Licensees use of the Licensed Marks. All goodwill associated with the
Licensed Marks shall inure to and belong exclusively to Licensor (including,
without limitation, any goodwill that may accrue by virtue of Licensors use
of the Licensed Marks). Licensor reserves any and all rights to, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to, preserve, apply for, register,
prosecute, perfect, maintain, defend, enforce or take any other action with
respect to any of the Licensed Marks so as not to diminish or materially
impact Licensees rights under the License. During the Term, Licensee shall
take such action (including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of
additional documents and the giving of testimony) as Licensor may reasonably
request to effect, perfect, evidence, register, defend or enforce any of the
Licensed Marks in any jurisdiction in which Licensee is operating the
Business; provided that Licensor shall reimburse any out-of-pocket expenses
reasonably incurred to take any such action requested by Licensor. During the
Term, Licensor, at its own cost and expense, keep Licensee updated and
provide Licensee with material information concerning all filings, office
actions, correspondence and other documentation filed with, sent to, issued
by, or received from any trademark, patent or copyright office or any other
governmental agency in connection with any such activities to the extent such
matters directly affect Licensees rights under the License. During the Term,
Licensee shall not contest the validity, enforceability, registration or
Licensors ownership of any of the Licensed Marks. Licensee shall not
register, make any filing with any governmental or regulatory authority with
respect to, or claim any title to or ownership of any of the Licensed Marks or
any confusingly similar mark without the prior written consent of Licensor,
in each case, in any jurisdiction in which Licensor used the License Marks
prior to the Effective Date.

3.2. Third-Party Infringement. If Licensee becomes aware of any actual or
suspected infringement or other unauthorized use of any of the Licensed Marks,
then Licensee shall give Licensor prompt written notice thereof including,
without limitation, a copy of any documentation in the possession or control
of Licensee that may evidence such infringement or other unauthorized use.
Licensee shall not take any other action with respect to the alleged
infringement, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of any of the
Licensed Marks without the prior written consent of Licensor.

Section 4\. Limited Warranties and Liabilities 

4.1. Mutual Representations and Warranties. Licensor and Licensee each hereby
represent and warrant to the other party that: (a) it has full corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder; (b) this Agreement has been duly authorized by all
necessary action on its part; and (c) it has not entered into any agreement
with or granted any rights whatsoever, or is not otherwise subject to any
obligations, that would be in conflict with its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



4 4.2. Limited Warranty. Licensor represents and warrants to Licensee that: (a)
Licensor has the right to grant the License in and to the Licensed Marks; (b)
neither Licensor nor any of its Affiliates have granted to any third party any
license or other right that conflicts with the License; and (c)
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Licensor does
not, and Licensees exercise of its rights under the License and other
provisions of this Agreement, will not, infringe the rights of any third party
under any trademark, or conflict with, or result in any breach of, require
consent under, any agreement between Licensor and any third party, or result
in, termination, cancellation, or modification of the rights granted to
Licensee under the License or the other provisions of this Agreement. The
sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty is set forth in
Section 5.1.

4.3. Disclaimer of Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 4.1
AND 4.2, EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO: MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE; WHETHER ANY OF THE LICENSED MARKS APPLY OR CAN BE USED
OUTSIDE OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION IN WHICH LICENSOR USED SUCH LICENSE
MARKS AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE; OR WHETHER ANY OF THE LICENSED MARKS CAN BE
USED OUTSIDE OF ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH LICENSOR USED SUCH LICENSE MARKS AS
OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE WITHOUT INFRINGING ANY TRADEMARK OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN SUCH JURISDICTION.

4.4. Exclusions from Liability. EXCEPT TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION UNDER
SECTION 5 WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, AND EXCEPT IN CASES OF FRAUD OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES OR BREACH OF SECTION 7.3 OR
LICENSEES BREACH OF SECTIONs 2 OR 3.1, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THE
AFFILIATES OF SUCH PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
MULTIPLE, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR
LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR INCOME, BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, DIMINUTION IN
VALUE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ANY ACTIVITIES OR NON-PERFORMANCE
HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ARISING FROM BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY IS ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE OR IF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN
REASONABLY FORESEEN.

Section 5\. Indemnification

 

5.1. By Licensee. Licensee hereby agrees, at all times during the Term and
thereafter, to fully indemnify Licensor and its Affiliates, and any of its
and their respective shareholders, owners, officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives against, and defend and hold

 



5  such Persons harmless from, any and all Losses claimed by a third party
arising from or in connection with a) the gross negligence, Fraud or willful
misconduct by Licensee or any of its Affiliates or any of its and their
respective shareholders, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives, in each case related to the licenses granted under this
Agreement; or b) any breach by Licensee of any of its covenants, agreements
or obligations under this Agreement, in each case of the foregoing clauses a)
and b) except to the extent of those Losses which Licensor has an obligation
to indemnify pursuant to Section 5.2, as to which Losses each party
shall indemnify the other to the extent of its liability for such Losses.

5.2. By Licensor. Licensor hereby agrees at all times during the Term and
thereafter, to fully indemnify Licensee and its Affiliates, and any of its and
their respective shareholders, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives against, and defend and hold such Persons harmless from,
any and all Losses claimed by a third party arising from or in connection with
a) the gross negligence, Fraud or willful misconduct by Licensor or any of its
Affiliates, and any of its and their respective shareholders, owners,
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, in each case
related to the licenses granted under this Agreement; or b) any breach by
Licensor of any of its covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement, in each case of the foregoing clauses a) and b) except to the
extent of those Losses which Licensee has an obligation to indemnify pursuant
to Section 5.1, as to which Losses each party shall indemnify the other to the
extent of its liability for such Losses.

 

5.3. No right of indemnification shall exist under the Purchase Agreement for
claims arising out of the performance of this Agreement, it being the intent
of the parties that such claims shall be solely governed by the provisions of
this Agreement.

5.4. Notice and Cooperation. Either party (the " _Indemnitee_ ") intending to
claim indemnification under this Section 5 shall notify the other party (the "
_Indemnitor_ ") promptly in writing of any action, claim or liability
in respect of which the Indemnitee believes it is entitled to claim
indemnification, provided that the failure to give timely notice to the
Indemnitor shall not release the Indemnitor from any liability to the
indemnitee except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall have the right, by notice to the
indemnitee, to assume the defense of any such action or claim within the
thirty (30) day period after the Indemnitors receipt of notice of any action
or claim with counsel of the Indemnitors choice and at the sole cost of the
Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor so assumes such defense, the indemnitee may
participate therein through counsel of its choice, but at the sole cost of
the indemnitee. The party not assuming the defense of any such claim shall
render all reasonable assistance to the party assuming such defense, and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such assistance shall be for the account of
the Indemnitor. No such claim shall be settled other than by the party
conducting the defense thereof, and then only with the consent of the other
party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that
the Indemnitee shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any
such action or claim which imposes on the Indemnitee any liability or
obligation that cannot be assumed and performed in full by the Indemnitor, and
the Indemnitee shall have no right to withhold its consent to any settlement
of any such action or claim if the settlement involves only the payment of
money by the Indemnitor or its insurer and includes a full release of claims
with respect to the Indemnitee.

 



6 Section 6\. Term and Termination

 

6.1. Term. The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date
and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 6.2 or 6.3 shall expire on
the earlier to occur of (a) the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date

hereinafter be referred to as the "Disclosing Party", and the party receiving
such information shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Receiving Party")

nature (collectively, the "Information"); provided, that for the purposes of
this Agreement, Information shall not include information that (i) becomes

of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement; (ii) the Receiving Party can

Agreement without an obligation to keep such information confidential; (iii)

connection with this Agreement from the Disclosing Party solely as necessary
to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement (and
for no other purpose whatsoever) and it shall take the same degree of care

event less than a reasonable degree of care; provided, that Licensor may

parties under the Purchase Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, this
Agreement and all schedules hereto and thereto, constitutes the full,
complete, final and integrated agreement between the parties relating to the

clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable for any

or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein contained invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Upon any such
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

shall take precedence.

publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, written or oral,
whether relating to this Agreement or any documents or transactions

GUARANTEE (" _Guarantee_ "), dated as of September 11, 2017, given by The
Cooper Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _TCC_ "), in favor of Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (" _Teva_ ").

PREAMBLE

 

On the date of this Guarantee, CooperSurgical, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_CSI_ "), which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of TCC, entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement between CSI and Teva (in its current form and as it
may be amended in accordance with its terms, the " _APA_ ") in which CSI
agreed to purchase certain assets related to Tevas Paragard intrauterine
copper contraceptive device business, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set out in the APA (the " _Transaction_ "). As an inducement for
Teva to enter into the APA, TCC is willing to guarantee CSIs obligations
under the APA on the terms and conditions set out in this Guarantee.

ACCORDINGLY, TCC hereby agrees as follows:

1\. _Guarantee_. As an inducement for Teva to enter into the APA, TCC, for
itself and for its successors and assigns, hereby guarantees, on the terms
and conditions set out in this Guarantee, the payment and performance when due
of all liabilities, covenants and agreements of CSI contained in, or arising
under, the APA (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). If CSI fails to make any
payment or perform any covenant or agreement that it is obligated to pay or
perform under the Guaranteed Obligations, TCC shall promptly and fully make,
or cause to be made, that payment or perform, or cause to be performed, that
covenant in place of CSI.

2\. _Scope_. This Guarantee applies to the Guaranteed Obligations, and not to
any other obligations that CSI or any other Person may otherwise have to
Teva. " _Person_ " shall be construed broadly and means an individual or an
entity of any kind.

 

3\. _Defenses_. TCC shall not have any liability under this Guarantee or under
the APA, under any legal theory, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, other than as explicitly set out in this Guarantee or in
the APA, as applicable. TCC shall be entitled to assert, as defenses to TCCs
obligations under this Guarantee, any and all defenses that CSI may
have under the APA or any other agreement entered into by CSI and Teva in
connection with the Transaction.

4\. _Nature of Guarantee_. This is a guarantee of payment and performance,
not of collection, and Teva shall not be required to pursue any remedies it
may have against CSI under the APA.

 

5\. _TCC Waivers_. Without waiving or limiting any provision of the APA, TCC
hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee by any Person, (b)
notice of the amount of indebtedness or extent of performance owing under this
Guarantee, (c) notice of demand for payment, notice of default or non-payment
or non-performance, presentment, protest, notice of protest, and notice of
dishonor, (d) any defense based on any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of TCC or CSI, or any insolvency bankruptcy,
reorganization, liquidation or similar proceeding of TCC or CSI or affecting
any of their assets. TCC acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct
and indirect benefits from the consummation of the Transaction, and that it
is knowingly granting the waivers set out in this _Section_ __ _ 5_ in
contemplation of those benefits.

 



1 6\. _Representations and Warranties_. TCC hereby represents and warrants to
Teva that TCC has duly executed and delivered this Guarantee, and that this
Guarantee constitutes the valid and binding obligation of TCC, enforceable
against TCC in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles.

7.  _Expiration_. This Guarantee shall expire, and TCC shall have no further
obligation under this Guarantee, on the date that is 12 months after the
Closing Date (as that term is defined in the APA) (the " _Expiration Date_
"),  _unless_ Teva asserts, on or before the Expiration Date, a claim under
this Guarantee alleging that Guaranteed Obligations are due and owing from TCC
(a " _Claim_ "), in which case this Guarantee shall expire, and TCC
shall have no further obligation under this Guarantee, on the later of (a)
the Expiration Date and (b) the date on which that Claim is finally resolved
and any Guaranteed Obligations due and owing from TCC under the final
resolution of that Claim have been paid, performed or otherwise satisfied in
full.

8\. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any party to
