surrender of a Company Certificate in accordance with this Article&nbsp;II, the record holder thereof shall be issued or paid any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of iPCS Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of iPCS
Common Stock, all shares of iPCS Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates

otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to iPCS in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
