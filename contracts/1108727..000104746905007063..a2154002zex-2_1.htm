ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

 1.1 _ The Merger; Closing._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge with and into iPCS. iPCS shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter     

  

sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall terminate.

  

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. no later than three Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof (other than those conditions which relate to actions to be taken at the Closing) (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

  

  

 1.2 _ Effective Time._ On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary"), in such form as required by and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or, if another date and time is specified in such filing, such specified date and time, being the "Effective Time"). 

  

 1.3 _ Effects of the Merger._ At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL. 

  

 1.4 _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 1.7 and Section 2.1(e) hereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned (x) by the Company as treasury stock or (y) directly or indirectly by iPCS or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into 0.7725 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of iPCS Common Stock. All shares of Company Common Stock converted into iPCS Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (each, a "Company Certificate") previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter only represent the right to receive (i) certificates evidencing the number of whole shares of iPCS Common Stock and (ii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) and Section 2.1(e). Company Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of iPCS Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Certificates in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof, without any interest thereon. The parties understand and agree that the Exchange Ratio has been calculated based upon the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2 and that, in the event the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options (as defined below) or other stock equivalents of the Company is greater than or less than the amounts specifically set forth in Section 4.2 (including as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2, (ii) the issuance after the date of this Agreement of restricted stock, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock (other than a Permitted Company Issuance (as defined below)) or (iii) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into stock or any stock equivalent of the Company, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change occurring after the date of this Agreement), the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted. Further, the parties understand and agree that the Exchange Ratio has been calculated based upon the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2 and that, in the event the number of outstanding shares of iPCS Common Stock, iPCS Preferred Stock, Wildcat options for 

  

      

  

the purchase of iPCS Common Stock or other stock equivalents of iPCS is
greater than or less than the amounts specifically set forth in Section 5.2
(including as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.2, (ii) the issuance after the date of this
Agreement of restricted stock, options, warrants or other rights to purchase
iPCS Common Stock (other than a Permitted iPCS Issuance (as defined below)) or
(iii) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into stock or any stock
equivalent of iPCS, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change
occurring after the date of this Agreement), the Exchange Ratio shall
be appropriately adjusted.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by iPCS or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of iPCS or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of iPCS Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall become treasury stock of iPCS. 

  

  

 1.5 _ Stock Options._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option (a "Converted Company Option") to purchase shares of iPCS Common Stock in an amount and at the exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Company\'s 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Company Option Plan"), the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, and any other agreements between the Company and an optionee regarding Company Options): 

    

 (i) the number of shares of iPCS Common Stock to be subject to the Converted Company Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional share of iPCS Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and 

   

 (ii) the exercise price per share of iPCS Common Stock under the Converted Company Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

    

 (b) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Option shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A of the Code (or a good faith interpretation thereof in the absence of definitive guidance thereunder), and to the extent it is not so consistent, such Section 424(a) and Section 409A shall override anything to the contrary contained herein. The duration and other terms of the Converted Company Options shall be the same as the original Company Options, except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to be references to iPCS. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but no later than 15 Business Days thereafter, iPCS shall use its reasonable best efforts to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on Form S-8 or other appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness thereof) shares of iPCS Common Stock issuable pursuant to all Company Options converted pursuant to this Section 1.5. 

  

  

 1.6 _ iPCS Common Stock._ Except for any shares of iPCS Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which shall be converted into treasury stock of iPCS as contemplated by 

        

Section 1.4 hereof, the shares of iPCS Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and
such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.

  

 1.7 _ Shares of Dissenting Stockholders._ 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger or did not consent to the Merger in writing and has properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below) unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, then as of the occurrence of such event, each share of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give iPCS (a) prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock or attempted withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and (b) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of iPCS, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

   

 (b) iPCS shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any demands by a iPCS stockholder who (i) did not vote in favor of the Merger or did not consent to the Merger in writing and (ii) has properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL. 

  

  

 1.8 _ Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws._ At the Effective Time, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of iPCS then in effect (in each case as amended in accordance with Section 7.12 hereof) shall be the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.9 _ Directors and Officers._ The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in Section 7.12 hereof, each to hold office in accordance with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. Subject to Section 7.12, the officers of iPCS immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 1.10 _ Tax Consequences._ It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Section 368 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

ARTICLE II

  

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

   

 2.1 _ Exchange of Shares, Distributions._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken, the following actions: 

  

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, iPCS shall deposit with a nationally recognized institution reasonably satisfactory to iPCS and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing shares of iPCS Common Stock required to effect the conversion of the Company Common Stock into shares of 

  

      

  

iPCS Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(e). Promptly after the
Effective Time, but no later than five Business Days thereafter, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each record holder of a Company Certificate or Company
Certificates a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
that delivery of the Merger Consideration shall be effected only upon proper
delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and all other
documents that may be reasonably required from each holder to effect the
transfer of the Merger Consideration to each such holder or its designee
(collectively, the "Exchange Documents"). Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Company Certificate, together with properly completed
Exchange Documents, each holder of a Company Certificate will be entitled to
receive (x) certificates ("iPCS Certificates") representing the number of
whole shares of iPCS Common Stock which such record holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check
representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares of iPCS Common
Stock, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(e) (together with the iPCS Common Stock represented by the iPCS
Certificates, the "Merger Consideration"), and the Company Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of iPCS Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.1, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to iPCS Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of record of any unsurrendered Company Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Certificate in accordance with this Article II. At the time of the surrender of a Company Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be issued or paid any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of iPCS Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of iPCS Common Stock, all shares of iPCS Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Registered holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall not be entitled to vote any shares represented by such Certificates after the Effective Time at any meeting of iPCS stockholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of iPCS Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to iPCS in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of iPCS Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of iPCS that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

      

  
  

 (d) Immediately upon and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and converted into the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in the manner provided in this Article II. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of iPCS Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to iPCS Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of iPCS. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of iPCS Common Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale prices per share of iPCS Common Stock as reported on the National Quotation Bureau\'s Pink Sheets for the twenty trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of iPCS Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof. 

   

 (f) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, unless otherwise agreed, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as iPCS may direct and in a form reasonably satisfactory to iPCS, as indemnity against any such claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in the manner provided in this Article II. 

   

 (g) iPCS shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as iPCS is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by iPCS, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by iPCS. With respect to any stockholder who is not a foreign person, iPCS shall receive a certificate of nonforeign status in a form reasonably acceptable to it at or prior to the time such stockholder surrenders its Certificates for exchange in accordance with this Article II. The Company shall deliver to iPCS on or prior to the Effective Time a certificate from the Company in a form reasonably acceptable to iPCS that the Company is not a "United States Real Property Holding Company" within the meaning of section 897(c)(2) of the Code. 

  

 (h) Any shares of iPCS Common Stock, and any portion of the cash with respect to the iPCS Common Stock deposited by iPCS with the Exchange Agent (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remain unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company six months after the Effective Time shall be transferred to iPCS. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.1 shall thereafter be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their Merger Consideration and any cash, dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable and/or payable pursuant hereto upon due surrender of their Certificates, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly 

  

      

  
  

delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. If any Company Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

or any of the rights of Sprint PCS under the Sprint Licenses other than
regulatory events generally applicable to personal communications services
licensees. No facts are known to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
if known by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction would present a
substantial risk that any Company Permit could be revoked, suspended,
adversely modified, not renewed, impaired, restricted, terminated or
forfeited, or could result in a substantial fine imposed against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither the execution by the Company of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions

misappropriating or otherwise coming into conflict with any Intellectual
Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not breach, violate
or conflict with any instrument or agreement concerning any Company Material
Intellectual Property, will not cause the forfeiture or termination of or
give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any of the Company
Material Intellectual Property, or trigger additional fees or transfer costs
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or impair
the right of the Surviving Corporation to make, use, sell, license or dispose
of, or to bring any action for the infringement of, any Company Material
Intellectual Property.

The bar dates for asserting administrative claims and pre-petition claims (except for ordinary course trade debt incurred after the date of commencement of iPCS bankruptcy case) in iPCS\' bankruptcy have passed. 

  

 5.9 _ Property._ 

  

  

 (a) Each of iPCS and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens, to all of the properties and assets, real and personal, tangible or intangible, which are reflected on the iPCS Balance Sheet or acquired after the date of the iPCS Balance Sheet, except Permitted Liens. 

  

 (b) Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real property. 

  

  

 5.10 _ Leases._ 

  

  

 (a) Section 5.10(a) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and complete list of each lease pursuant to which iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real or personal property (excluding leases or licenses of tower space to which either iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and leases relating solely to personal property calling for rental or similar periodic payments not exceeding $100,000 per annum) (each a "iPCS Lease").

There are no existing defaults by iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the iPCS Leases in any material respect, and to the knowledge of iPCS no event has occurred that (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event) would constitute a material default under any iPCS Lease. iPCS has received no notice, and has no other reason to believe, that any lessor under any iPCS Lease will not consent (where such consent 

  

      

  
  

is necessary) to the consummation of the Merger without requiring any
material modification of the rights or obligations of the lessee thereunder.

Section 5.10(c) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule identifies all iPCS Tower Leases which provide for the lease or license of six or more sites. 

  

 (d) iPCS have previously delivered to the Company a true and correct schedule which lists the iPCS\' wireless tower sites (the "iPCS Tower Sites").

 (d) To the knowledge of iPCS, iPCS has never released any Hazardous Substance in a manner that has given or would give rise to any material liability. 

   

 (e) None of the iPCS Real Property is listed or, to the knowledge of the iPCS, proposed for listing, on the "National Priorities List" under CERCLA, as updated through the date hereof, or any similar state list of sites requiring investigation or cleanup.

 5.16 _ Compliance with Applicable Law._ 

  

  

 (a) Except for the Sprint Licenses, iPCS and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times held, all licenses, certificates, consents, franchises, permits and authorizations (each, a "iPCS Permit") necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (as presently conducted) and the lawful ownership, use and operation of their respective assets (as presently owned, operated and used) under and pursuant to all, and have complied with and are not in default in any material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, and neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of any violations of any of the above, except where the failure to have any such iPCS Permit, the failure to be in compliance, or such violation or default has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on iPCS. 

  

      

  

 (b) iPCS has no knowledge of any investigation, notice of apparent liability, violation, forfeiture or other order or complaint issued by or before the FCC or any other Governmental Entity or of any other proceedings of or before the FCC or any other Governmental Entity relating to iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries or to any authorizations under which iPCS conducts its business, not including the Sprint Licenses.

Each Material iPCS Permit is valid and in full force and effect without condition, except for conditions listed on the face of such Material iPCS Permit or generally applicable to similarly situated companies. To the knowledge of iPCS, no event has occurred which (i) results in, or after notice or lapse of time or both would reasonably be expected to result in, revocation, suspension, adverse modification, non-renewal, impairment, restriction or termination of, or order of forfeiture or substantial fine with respect to, any Material iPCS Permits or the Sprint Licenses, or (ii) affects or would reasonably be expected in the future to affect any of the rights of iPCS or its Subsidiaries under any Material iPCS Permits or any of the rights of Sprint PCS under the Sprint Licenses other than regulatory events generally applicable to personal communications services licensees.

be the subject of an application for a favorable determination letter within
the applicable remedial amendment period which has not expired, and, if a
favorable determination or opinion letter has been received, iPCS is not aware
of any circumstances reasonably likely to result in the revocation or denial
of any such favorable determination or opinion letter, (iii) no iPCS Benefit

"multiemployer pension plan," as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, (vi) all contributions or other amounts payable by iPCS or any iPCS
ERISA Affiliates as of the Effective Time with respect to each iPCS Benefit
Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or accrued in
accordance with GAAP, (vii) neither iPCS nor any iPCS ERISA Affiliate, nor to
the knowledge of iPCS, any other person, has engaged in a transaction or has

Section 4975, 4976 or 4980B of the Code, (viii) there are no pending, or, to
the knowledge of iPCS, threatened or anticipated claims or proceedings (other
than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of iPCS
Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto, and (ix) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (y) entitle any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of iPCS or any iPCS ERISA Affiliate
to severance pay, termination pay or any other payment or benefit, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement or (z) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase the amount or value of compensation or benefits due any
such employee, officer, director or consultant. None of the assets of any iPCS
Benefit Plan are invested in iPCS Common Stock.

 (a) Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated or failed to meet any material deadline or requirement in the iPCS Sprint Agreements, except as has been remedied, waived or modified prior to the date hereof and previously disclosed to the Company in writing, and iPCS has no reason to believe that future material deadlines cannot be met. Each applicable Subsidiary of iPCS has completed the required build-out of its respective territory pursuant to Section 2.1 of the management agreement forming part of the iPCS Sprint Agreements (including those aspects of the build-out not required to be completed until a future date) and each such Subsidiary of iPCS is in compliance with all build-out requirements applicable to it, in each case as set forth in the iPCS Sprint Agreements. 

  

 (b) Section 5.19(b) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all Contracts between iPCS, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Sprint PCS, on the other hand (collectively, the "iPCS Sprint Agreements"). iPCS has made available to the Company a true and complete copy of each of the iPCS Sprint Agreements listed in Section 5.12(a) and Section 5.19(b) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, together with all amendments, waivers or other material changes thereto. There are no unwritten amendments to, or material waivers under, any iPCS Sprint Agreement. 

  

 (c) The iPCS Sprint Agreements are valid, binding and enforceable against iPCS or its Subsidiaries and Sprint PCS, in accordance with their respective terms, and shall be in full force and effect without penalty in accordance with their terms upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and limitations on the availability of equitable remedies. iPCS and its Subsidiaries have 

  

      

  
  

performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed
by them and they are not in default under or in breach of, nor in receipt of
any claim of default or breach under, any of the iPCS Sprint Agreements,
which default or breach would individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iPCS. To the knowledge of iPCS,
no event has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice
or both would result in a default, breach or event of noncompliance by iPCS or
any of its Subsidiaries, which default, breach or event of noncompliance
would individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on iPCS, or would permit termination or modification
by Sprint PCS, under any of the iPCS Sprint Agreements. Other than a breach
that may result on account of the Sprint/Nextel Merger, neither iPCS nor any
of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of any breach or cancellation or
anticipated breach or cancellation by Sprint PCS of any of the iPCS Sprint
Agreements. iPCS has provided the Company with copies of all written notices
(excluding e-mail messages) received by it from Sprint PCS during the last
three months (i) delivered pursuant to the official notice provisions of any
of the iPCS Sprint Agreements or (ii) alleging a material breach of any of
the iPCS Sprint Agreements.

  

  

 5.20 _ Intellectual Property._ iPCS owns or has the right to use, whether through licensing or otherwise, and to authorize others to use, all Intellectual Property significant to the businesses of iPCS and its Subsidiaries in substantially the same manner as such businesses are conducted on the date hereof ("iPCS Material Intellectual Property"). Except as set forth in Section 5.20 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule: (i) no written claim of invalidity or conflicting ownership rights with respect to any iPCS Material Intellectual Property has been made by a third party and no such Intellectual Property is the subject of any pending or, to iPCS\' knowledge, threatened action, suit, claim, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding; (ii) no Person or entity has given notice to iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries that the use of any iPCS Material Intellectual Property by iPCS, any iPCS Subsidiary or any licensee is infringing or has infringed any domestic or foreign patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, copyright or design right, or that iPCS, any of its Subsidiaries or any licensee has misappropriated or improperly used or disclosed any trade secret, confidential information or know-how; (iii) to iPCS\' knowledge after due inquiry for such purpose, the making, using, selling, manufacturing, marketing, licensing, reproduction, distribution, or publishing of any process, machine, manufacture or product related to any iPCS Material Intellectual Property, does not and will not infringe any domestic or foreign patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, copyright or design right of any third party, and does not and will not involve the misappropriation or improper use or disclosure of any trade secrets, confidential information or know-how of any third party; (iv) to iPCS\' knowledge, there exists no prior act or current conduct or use by iPCS, any of its Subsidiaries or any third party that would void or invalidate any iPCS Material Intellectual Property; (v) to iPCS\' knowledge, no other Person is interfering with, infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise coming into conflict with any Intellectual Property of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by iPCS and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not breach, violate or conflict with any instrument or agreement concerning any iPCS Material Intellectual Property, will not cause the forfeiture or termination of or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any of the iPCS Material Intellectual Property, or trigger additional fees or transfer costs payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or impair the right of iPCS to make, use, sell, license or dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement of, any iPCS Material Intellectual Property. In addition, the matters disclosed on Section 5.20 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on iPCS. 

  

 5.21 _ Labor Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to Persons employed by them. No union representation 

  

      

  

question exists and, to the knowledge of iPCS and its Subsidiaries, there has
been no union organization effort respecting the employees of iPCS and its
Subsidiaries. Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in any
material respect in payments to any of its employees for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed
by them or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees. No retired
employees of iPCS are entitled to (i) receive current or future compensation
from iPCS or its Subsidiaries other than pursuant to the terms of any iPCS
Benefit Plan or (ii) participate in any iPCS Benefit Plan (except as required
by section 4980B of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state law).

  

 (b) (i) Each of iPCS and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and other applicable laws, domestic or foreign, respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours, immigration, the payment of social security and similar taxes, occupational safety and health and plant closing, and has not and is not engaged in any unfair labor practice; (ii) no unfair labor practice complaint against iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries is pending before the National Labor Relations Board; (iii) there is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage actually pending or threatened against or involving iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) no grievance that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect upon iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of their respective businesses exists, no arbitration proceeding arising out of or under any collective bargaining agreement is pending and no claim therefor has been asserted; and (v) no collective bargaining agreement is currently being negotiated by iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) Except for employees who are parties to employment agreements with iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, which agreements are set forth in Section 5.21(c) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, and except as otherwise disclosed in Section 5.21(c) of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, all employees of iPCS and its Subsidiaries are terminable at will, with or without cause, and without cost to iPCS and its Subsidiaries for severance obligations, or any other liability, except for payment of accrued salaries or wages and vacation pay. No employee or former employee has any right to be rehired by iPCS or its Subsidiaries prior to the hiring of a person not previously employed by iPCS or such Subsidiary. 

  

 (d) Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that could constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended, or could otherwise trigger any notice requirement or liability under any local or state plant closing law. 

  

  

 5.22 _ Reorganization._ As of the date of this Agreement, iPCS has no reason to believe that the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. As of the date of this Agreement, iPCS knows of no reason why it will be unable to deliver to Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP and to Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP representation letters with respect to iPCS in form and substance sufficient to enable such counsel to render the opinions required by Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c). 

  

 5.23 _ Broker\'s Fees._ Except as set forth in Section 5.23 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers or directors, has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any broker\'s fees, commissions or finder\'s fees in connection with the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.24 _ Opinion._ Prior to the execution of this Agreement, iPCS has received an opinion from Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio, is fair, from a financial point of view, to iPCS and the stockholders of iPCS Common Stock and such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. 

        
  

 5.25 _ Related Party Transactions._ Except as set forth in Section 5.25 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of iPCS, no stockholder, nor any officer or director of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries (or any immediate family member thereof) owns or holds, directly or indirectly, any interest in (excepting holdings solely for passive investment purposes of securities of publicly held and traded entities constituting less than 5% of the equity of any such entity), or is an officer, director, employee or consultant of any Person that is, a competitor, lessor, lessee, service provider, customer or supplier of iPCS or which conducts a business similar to any business conducted by iPCS. No stockholder, officer or director of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries (or any immediate family member thereof) (a) owns or holds, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any Intellectual Property used by iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed that iPCS is giving the representation in this clause (a) with respect to its stockholders to iPCS\' knowledge), (b) to the knowledge of iPCS has any claim, charge, action or cause of action against iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, except for claims for reasonable unreimbursed travel or entertainment expenses, accrued vacation pay or accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan existing on the date hereof, (c) to the knowledge of iPCS, has made, on behalf of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries, any payment or commitment to pay any commission, fee or other amount to, or to purchase or obtain or otherwise contract to purchase or obtain any goods or services from, any other Person of which any stockholder, officer or director of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries (or any immediate family member thereof) is a partner or shareholder (except holdings solely for passive investment purposes of securities of publicly held and traded entities constituting less than 5% of the equity of any such entity), (d) owes any money to iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries or (e) has any material interest in any property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in or pertaining to the business of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 5.26 _ iPCS Information._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by iPCS or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, and (b) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting and the iPCS Stockholder Meeting, in any such case, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 5.27 _ Required Vote of iPCS._ Except for the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of iPCS to approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the amendment to iPCS\' Restated Certificate of Incorporation as contemplated herein, no vote of the stockholders of iPCS, or any class thereof, or of the holders of any securities of iPCS (equity or otherwise), is required by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of iPCS, the iPCS Plan of Reorganization or otherwise in order for iPCS to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the total number of shares of iPCS Common Stock subject to the AIGGIC Support Agreement and the Silver Point Support Agreement constitutes approximately 52.1% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding iPCS Common Stock. 

  

 5.28 _ Takeover Statutes._ No Takeover Statute (with the exception of Section 203 of the DGCL) is applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). The action previously taken by the Board of Directors of iPCS in approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including iPCS entering into the Apollo Support Agreement and the Silver Point Support Agreement) is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. 

       

  5.29 _ Indebtedness._ The aggregate principal amount of
indebtedness for borrowed money of iPCS and its Subsidiaries outstanding as
of the date hereof is approximately $165,000,000. Except as set forth in
Section 5.29 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, iPCS and its Subsidiaries are
not subject to any prepayment penalties with respect to any such
indebtedness. Except as set forth in Section 5.29 of the iPCS Disclosure
Schedule, neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any "restricted
payment" as defined under the applicable iPCS Debt Agreement.

  

 5.30 _ Disclosure Controls and Procedures._ The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of iPCS have each evaluated the effectiveness of iPCS\' disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Exchange Act) and, based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the date hereof, iPCS\' disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting such officers on a timely basis to material information relating to iPCS (including iPCS\' consolidated Subsidiaries) required to be included in reports to be filed or submitted by iPCS under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.31 _ Reports._ iPCS has previously made available to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since July 20, 2004 by iPCS with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the "iPCS Reports"), (b) written communication between iPCS and the SEC since July 20, 2004, and (c) communication mailed by iPCS to its stockholders since July 20, 2004, and no such registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, proxy statement or communication as of its date of filing contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Other than as set forth in Section 5.31 of the iPCS Disclosure Schedule, iPCS has timely filed all iPCS Reports and other documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and, as of their respective dates, all iPCS Reports complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, including rules and regulations relating to the filing of exhibits thereto. No executive officer of iPCS has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and no enforcement action has been initiated against iPCS by the SEC relating to disclosures contained in any iPCS Report. 

  

 5.32 _ License Qualifications._ To the knowledge of iPCS, there are no facts specific to iPCS or its stockholders that would make iPCS ineligible to (a) acquire and hold personal communications service licenses generally, (b) acquire and hold the Company License and (c) obtain the authorization and approval from the FCC necessary for iPCS to acquire the Company License.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

 7.1 _ Regulatory Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use all reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file following the date of this Agreement all necessary documentation (including assisting each party\'s stockholders with filing notifications required to be filed by any such stockholder under the HSR Act in connection with the Merger), to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including filing the notification provided for under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act")) in connection with the Merger, and taking all necessary action to provide all information requested by a Governmental Entity and to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.1(a) shall require iPCS or the Company to agree to the imposition of material conditions or any requirement of divestiture of a material asset as a result of antitrust or other regulatory concerns. The Company and iPCS shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or iPCS, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form filed under the HSR Act or communications regarding the same or documents or information submitted in response to any request for additional information or 

  

      

  

documents pursuant to the HSR Act which reveal iPCS\' or the Company\'s
negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase price expectations or as
otherwise may be prohibited by law or contractual obligation or would
contravene existing attorney-client privilege. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the notifications, applications or transactions contemplated
herein. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party
consent described above, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and
shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto,
to minimize any adverse effect upon iPCS and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses after the Effective Time which results or
could reasonably be expected to result from, the failure to obtain such
consent.

   

 (b) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company and iPCS shall prepare and file with the FCC an application requesting its approval of the change of control of the Company License to iPCS (the "Approval Application"). The Company and iPCS thereafter shall diligently take or cooperate in the taking of all steps that are necessary or appropriate to prosecute the Approval Application and to obtain the grant of the Approval Application as expeditiously as reasonably practicable. The parties agree to consult with one another as to the approach to be taken with the FCC with respect to obtaining any necessary consent or authority to the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the parties shall keep the other party reasonably informed as to the status of any such communications with the FCC. 

  

 (c) Each of iPCS and the Company shall, upon request, furnish the other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of iPCS, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as may be prohibited by Section 7.1(a), law or contractual obligation or would contravene existing attorney-client privilege. 

   

 (d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to iPCS or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by iPCS or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of iPCS, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or would omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties to this Agreement and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed as soon as practicable with such Governmental Entity. 

  

 (e) Each of iPCS and the Company shall promptly furnish each other with true and correct copies of written communications received by iPCS or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form filed under the HSR Act or communications regarding the same or documents or information submitted in response to any request for additional information or documents pursuant to the HSR Act which reveal iPCS\' or the Company\'s negotiating objectives or strategies or purchase price expectations or as 

  

      

  
  

otherwise may be prohibited by law or contractual obligation or would
contravene existing attorney-client privilege.

  

  

 7.2 _ Access to Information._ 

  

  

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of iPCS, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to iPCS all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as iPCS may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of the Company\'s customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

  

 (b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, iPCS shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Company, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to such information regarding iPCS and its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably necessary for the Company to confirm that the representations and warranties of iPCS contained herein are true and correct and that the covenants of iPCS contained herein have been performed in all material respects. Neither iPCS nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of iPCS\' customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 (d) Each of iPCS and the Company agrees to provide the other with copies of any and all material correspondence between such party and Sprint PCS during the period prior to the Effective Time, except as may be prohibited by law or contractual obligation or would contravene existing attorney-client privilege. 

  

 (e) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth herein. 

  

  

 7.3 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any financial or legal advisor or other retained representative) of the Company or its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer or exchange offer) or similar transactions 

  

      

  

involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would
constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any of the foregoing
inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as a "Company Acquisition
Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information in connection with, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with any Person in connection with, an Alternative
Transaction, or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative
Transaction.

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, iPCS will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any financial or legal advisor or other retained representative) of iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer or exchange offer) or similar transactions involving iPCS or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as a "iPCS Acquisition Proposal" and, together with a Company Acquisition Proposal, an "Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with any Person in connection with, an Alternative Transaction, or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. 

  

 (c) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means, with respect to the Company or iPCS, as the case may be (for this purpose, the "Target Party"), any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any third Person (or group of Persons) other than the other party to this Agreement (the "Non-Target Party") or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Target Party or of the outstanding voting power of the Target Party, whether from the Target Party or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or any other transaction involving the Target Party (other than the Merger) or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any third Person or group of Persons (other than the Non-Target Party or its Affiliates) party thereto, or its stockholders, owns or would own more than 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock or the outstanding voting power of the Target Party or, if applicable, the parent entity resulting from any such transaction immediately upon consummation thereof, or (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any third Person (or group of Persons) other than the Non-Target Party or its Affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Target Party and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination involving any of the Subsidiaries of the Target Party) of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Target Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction. 

  

 (d) The Target Party will notify the Non-Target Party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any communication of an intent or desire to make an Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that had previously been made, or any request for non-public information relating to the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that informs the Board of Directors of the Target Party or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to the Non-Target Party will be made orally and in writing and will indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to 

  

      

  
  

the properties, books or records of the Target Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. The Target Party will
keep the Non-Target Party fully informed, on a current basis, of any material
changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or the iPCS Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Target Party may furnish or cause to be furnished information to, and enter or cause to be entered into discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as applicable, if the Target Party\'s Board of Directors (the "Target Board") has (i) determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor or advisors) that such proposal or offer constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (ii) provided prior or contemporaneous notice to the Non-Target Party of its intent to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such Person, and (iii) obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms with respect to confidentiality that are determined by the Target Party to be substantially similar to and not less favorable to the Target Party in the aggregate than those contained in the Letter Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements will not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Target Party from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement). The Target Party will provide the Non-Target Party with all information regarding the Target Party with which the Non-Target Party has not previously been provided that is provided to any Person making any such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal or offer made by a third Person (or group of Persons) to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a merger, share exchange, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction involving the Target Party pursuant to which the stockholders of the Target Party immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of, and less than 50% of the outstanding voting power of, the Target Party or the parent entity resulting from any such transaction immediately upon consummation thereof, (ii) the acquisition by any third Person or group of Persons (including by means of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving the Target Party), directly or indirectly, of ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock of, and more than 50% of the outstanding voting power of, the Target Party, or (iii) the acquisition by any third Person (or group of Persons) of more than 50% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Target Party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, in each case that the Target Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor or advisors) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Target Party stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors. 

  

 (g) Except as permitted by this Section 7.3(g), neither the Target Board nor any committee thereof will (A) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Non-Target Party the recommendation by the Target Board, or any such committee, of this Agreement and the Merger, (B) recommend the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this sentence of this Section 7.3(g) being referred to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or approve, adopt or recommend, or cause or permit the Target Party to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement or obligation with respect to, any Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality 

  

      

  
  

agreement as referred to in Section 7.3(e)). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.3, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval or the iPCS Stockholder Approval, as applicable, if the
Target Board, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisor
or advisors, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, then (i) the Target Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and (ii) the Target Board may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(h) or Section 9.1(i), as applicable; _provided,
however_ , that in the case of clause (ii), the Target Board may only
terminate this Agreement pursuant to such applicable section if (A) the Target
Party has provided written notice to the Non-Target Party (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising the Non-Target Party that the Target Board has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal
and indicating that the Target Board intends to consider whether to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to such applicable section and (B) the Non-Target
Party has not, within three Business Days of the Non-Target Party\'s receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal, made an offer that the Target
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor or advisors) at a meeting of the Target
Board held for such purpose to be at least as favorable from a financial
point of view to the Target Party\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal.

  

 (h) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 will prohibit the Target Party or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effects that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no disclosure that the Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of iPCS may determine (after consultation with counsel) that it or the Company or iPCS, as applicable, is required to make under applicable law will constitute a violation of this Agreement. 

  

 (i) Each of the Company and iPCS and their respective Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the other party) conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons, other than the other party hereto, who have been furnished confidential information regarding such party in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. 

  

 (j) It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including financial or legal advisor or other retained representative) of either party or any of its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.3 by such party. 

  

  

 7.4 _ Stockholder Approvals._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to Section 9.1, the Company shall duly call, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective for purposes of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company, the Company shall submit to the stockholders of the Company for approval the matters contemplated by the Company Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement shall have terminated in accordance with its terms). Subject to Section 7.3 and Section 9.1, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Company Stockholder Approval. 

  

      

  

  

 (b) Subject to Section 9.1, iPCS shall duly call, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "iPCS Stockholder Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective for purposes of obtaining the iPCS Stockholder Approval (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding an Adverse Recommendation Change by iPCS, iPCS shall submit to the stockholders of iPCS for approval the matters contemplated by the iPCS Stockholder Approval unless this Agreement shall have terminated in accordance with its terms). Subject to Section 7.3 and Section 9.1, iPCS shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the iPCS Stockholder Approval. 

  

 (c) Subject to Section 9.1, the Company and iPCS shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholder Meeting and the iPCS Stockholder Meeting to occur on the same day. 

  

  

 7.5 _ Legal Conditions to Merger; Consents._ Prior to the Effective Time, each of iPCS and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the Merger and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be obtained by iPCS or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent, authorization, order or approval; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.5 shall require iPCS or the Company to agree to the requirement of any divestiture of a material asset in exchange for such consent. 

   

 7.6 _ Affiliates._ Prior to the Closing, if requested by iPCS, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other Person who may be deemed an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of iPCS following consummation of the Merger to deliver to iPCS a written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit D_ hereto, with respect to such Person\'s shares of iPCS Common Stock to be acquired in connection with the Merger. 

  

 7.7 _ Employee Benefit Plans; Options._ 

  

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, all employees of the Company (the "Company Employees") shall become employees of iPCS. Company Employees shall, for a period of at least one year thereafter, continue to participate in the Company Benefit Plans on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that following the Effective Time, (i) iPCS shall not be required to continue the employment of any Company Employee and (ii) iPCS may take action (A) to modify or amend any Company Benefit Plan (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) (provided that any such modification or amendment would not result in a Company Employee having, in the aggregate, less favorable benefits under such Company Benefit Plan than similarly-situated employees of iPCS under a corresponding iPCS arrangement) or (B) to provide the Company Employees with benefits under plans, policies, programs and arrangements in which similarly-situated employees of iPCS and its Subsidiaries participate from time to time (the "iPCS Plans"); provided further that iPCS and the Surviving Corporation shall not modify or amend the provisions of the KERP Severance Component, the Severance Plan or the Accounting Retention Agreements in any manner adverse to the beneficiaries thereunder without the written consent of the beneficiaries so affected. 

  

 (b) With respect to each iPCS Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), service with the Company and its Affiliates (or any predecessor 

  

      

  
  

entity), to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of
any Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as service with iPCS; _provided, however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. Company Employees shall
be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during
the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the iPCS Plan.

  

 (c) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, neither the Company nor any committee authorized to act on behalf of the Company shall take any action to change the vesting of, or otherwise modify, the terms of any Company Options outstanding after the date hereof. From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, neither iPCS nor any committee authorized to act on behalf of iPCS shall take any action to change the vesting of, or otherwise modify, the terms of any options to purchase shares of iPCS Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof. 

  

  

 7.8 _ Additional Agreements._ Prior to the Effective Time, each of iPCS and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by iPCS. 

  

 7.9 _ Advice of Changes._ Prior to the Effective Time, each of iPCS and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein.

If any iPCS Director ceases to serve on the Board of Directors of iPCS for any reason at any time prior to the First Post-Closing Annual Meeting, the remaining iPCS Directors shall promptly designate a person to replace such iPCS Director and the Board of Directors of iPCS shall appoint such designated person to the Board of Directors of iPCS.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if, prior to the First Post-Closing Annual Meeting, both a majority of the Horizon Directors and a majority of the iPCS Directors determine, in such directors\' independent business judgment, that it would be inconsistent with such directors\' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of iPCS for either RK or TY to continue in the offices referred to in the previous sentence, then such individual may be removed from such offices. If, prior to the First Post-Closing Annual Meeting, RK ceases to serve as the Chairman of the Board of iPCS for any reason, the Board of Directors of iPCS shall appoint a replacement in accordance with the By-Laws of iPCS.

In the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with iPCS; _provided, however_ , that (i) iPCS shall have the right to assume the defense thereof by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties and upon such assumption iPCS shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if iPCS elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of 

  

      

  

interest between iPCS and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties
may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with
iPCS, and iPCS shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties, (ii) iPCS shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iii) iPCS shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section, upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
notify promptly iPCS thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall
not affect the obligations of iPCS under this Section 7.14 except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices iPCS. iPCS shall take no
action which would conflict with the performance by iPCS of its duties under
this Section 7.14.

  

 (b) The provisions of this Section 7.14 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

 (d) In the event iPCS or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of iPCS assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.14.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). 

  

 _RECITALS_

  

 A. iPCS and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 17, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company will merge (the "Merger") with and into the iPCS, with the iPCS surviving the Merger; 

   

 B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Company Common Stock will be converted into shares of iPCS Common Stock; 

  

 C. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder is a material inducement to iPCS to enter into the Merger Agreement; and 

  

 D. Shareholder has been advised that Shareholder may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company, as such term is used for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 

  

 1. _ Acknowledgments by Shareholder._ Shareholder has read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and has discussed the requirements and applicable limitations on the Shareholder\'s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of iPCS Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger with such legal counsel as Shareholder has deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 2. _ Compliance with Rule 145 and the Act._ 

  

  

 (a) Shareholder has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares of iPCS Common Stock in connection with the Merger is expected to be effected pursuant to a Registration Statement filed by iPCS on Form S-4, and the resale of such shares will be subject to the restrictions set forth in Rule 145 under the Act unless such shares are otherwise transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or an appropriate exemption from registration, and (ii) Shareholder may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company. Shareholder accordingly agrees not to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of iPCS Common Stock issued to Shareholder in the Merger unless (i) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Act, (ii) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act, (iii) Shareholder delivers to iPCS a written opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to iPCS, to the effect that such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act or (iv) the legend described in Section 2(b) below is otherwise removed from the certificates representing such shares of iPCS Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

   

 (b) iPCS will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any iPCS Common Stock received by Shareholder pursuant to the Merger and there will be placed on the

therefor, legends stating in substance:

 

  

   
 "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
APPLIES, AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145, PURSUANT TO
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION
OF COUNSEL, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, TO THE
EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933."  
--- 
 

    

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend), and iPCS shall so instruct its transfer
agent if, (i) a registration statement respecting the sale of the shares has
been declared effective under the Act or (ii) Shareholder delivers to iPCS (w)
satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance
with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate will be issued in the

substance reasonably acceptable to iPCS, to the effect that sale of the
shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145, (y) a "no
action" letter obtained from the staff of the Commission, to the effect that
the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to the
Shareholder, or (z) a representation letter to the effect that either (A) one
year has elapsed from the date the Shareholder acquired the iPCS Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are available to
the Shareholder or (B) two years have elapsed from the date the Shareholder
acquired the iPCS Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of
Rule 145(d)(3) are applicable to the Shareholder.

  

  

 (c) Execution of this letter should not be considered (i) an admission by the Shareholder that such Shareholder is an "affiliate" of iPCS or (ii) a waiver of any rights that such Shareholder may have to object to any claim that such Shareholder is an affiliate on or after the date hereof. 

  

  

 3. _ Miscellaneous._ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 

   

 (b) This Agreement shall be enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. As used in this Agreement, the term "successors and assigns" means, where the context to permits, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees and successor trustees, and personal and other representatives. 

  

 (c) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

Exhibit E-1

  

 _Amendments to iPCS\' Restated Bylaws_

  

1. Section 5(a) shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

"The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose
of election of directors and for such other business as may lawfully come
before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors; _provided, however_ , that,
except as may be otherwise required by the rules of any applicable securities
exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission or applicable law, the 2006
annual meeting of the corporation shall be held no earlier than May 1, 2006.

  

[2. The following sentence shall be added at end of Section 5(c):

  

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or otherwise, at the 2005 annual meeting of the
stockholders of the corporation, the Horizon Directors, the iPCS Directors
and the Executive Director (in each case, as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation)(or any of such Directors\' replacements as determined in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation) shall each be nominated for
election to the Board of Directors of the corporation."]1  1

 This amendment will not be effected if the 2005 annual meeting is held prior to the Closing. 
  

3. The following two sentences shall be added at the end of Section 15: 

  

The Board of Directors shall, by a majority vote of the directors, appoint a
Chairman of the Board of the Directors, which Chairman of the Board of
Directors shall have such duties as set forth in these Bylaws or as otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
until at least the 2006 annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation,
Robert Katz ("RK") shall serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors (if
RK is willing and able to serve in such capacity and is otherwise a director
during such time) unless, prior to the 2006 annual meeting of the
stockholders of the corporation, both a majority of the Horizon Directors and
a majority of the iPCS Directors determine, in such directors\' independent
business judgment, that it would be inconsistent with such directors\'
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the corporation for RK to continue as
Chairman of the Board of Directors, in which case RK shall be removed as
Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors
shall be determined in accordance with the previous sentence."

  

4. The first sentence of Section 18 shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

"Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock and to
the provisions set forth in paragraph (4) of Article V.A. of the Certificate
of Incorporation, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from
death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly
created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors
may, except as otherwise provided by law, be filled by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum
of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining director, or by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock.

  

5. The third sentence of Section 19 shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

"Except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, paragraph (4) of Article V.A thereof), when one or more directors
shall resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a future date, such
vacancy or vacancies may, except as otherwise provided by law, be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office,
including those who have so resigned, or

  

Exhibit E-1-1      
  

by a sole remaining director, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the
Voting Stock, in each case, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so
chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director
whose place shall be vacated and until his or her successor shall have been
duly elected and qualified.

  

6. The following sentence shall be added to the end of Section 27(b): 

  

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or otherwise (but subject to the provisions of
Section 28(a) of these Bylaws), until at least the 2006 annual meeting of the
stockholders of the corporation, Timothy M. Yager ("TY") shall serve as the
Chief Executive Officer (if such individual is willing and able to serve in
such capacity during such time)."

  

7. The second sentence of Section 28(a) shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows: 

  

"Any officer may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Board of
Directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the corporation will
be served thereby; _provided, however_ , that prior to the 2006 annual
meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, TY may be removed as Chief
Executive Officer only if both a majority of the Horizon Directors and a
majority of the iPCS Directors determine, in such directors\' independent
business judgment, that it would be inconsistent with such directors\'
