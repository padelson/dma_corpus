conditions of this Agreement and the DLLCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall continue as the surviving limited liability company. The
Company, as the surviving company after the Merger, is sometimes referred to

(b) _Closing_. The closing of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the date hereof, or at such time and place and on such other

Closing shall take place at the offices of Brown Rudnick LLP in Boston,
Massachusetts, or at such other location as the parties hereto shall mutually
agree.

 



 

2.2 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by executing and filing a certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by, and executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DLLCA (the " _Certificate

and time of filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or such later time as may be agreed to by the parties
hereto and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.

 



 

2.4 _Limited Liability Company Agreement and Certificate of Formation of the
Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time and pursuant to the Merger, the
Companys limited liability company agreement shall be amended and restated
into the same form as Merger Subs limited liability company agreement in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and such limited liability
company agreement, as further amended as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Company, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law. At the
Effective Time, the Companys certificate of formation in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Company, until duly amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

2.5 _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Company_. Pursuant to the Merger,
the managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial managers of the Surviving Company, each manager to hold office in
accordance with the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Company, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in the manner provided in the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company and in accordance with applicable Law. The Company shall
cause each manager/director of the Company to tender his or her resignation
prior to the Effective Time, with each such resignation to be effective as of
the Effective Time.

 



 

2.6 _The Merger Consideration; Effect on Company Membership Units_. On the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of any Company Membership Units, the following
shall occur:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Membership Units_. Each Company Membership Unit
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished, and shall be automatically converted into solely
the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to a Pro Rata
Share of (i) the Initial Merger Consideration, (ii) the Additional Merger
Consideration, if any, (iii) the right to receive the Escrowed Consideration,
if any, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and (iv) the right to
receive the Member Representative Escrowed Consideration, if any, pursuant to
the terms of the Member Representative Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Units of Merger Sub_. Each Merger Sub Membership Unit issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become, as of the
Effective Time, a unit of the Surviving Company. Each membership certificate
of Merger Sub, if any, evidencing ownership of any Merger Sub Membership Units
shall continue to evidence ownership of units of the Surviving Company. Parent
shall be admitted as a member of the Surviving Company effective as of the
Effective Time and bound by the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company in effect as of the Effective Time.

 



 

2.7 _Escrow_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited (a) an amount equal to $5,975,000 (the " _Escrowed Consideration"_
), with U.S. Bank N.A. **** or any successor escrow agent, in each case, an
entity which shall be a "bank" (a " _Bank_ ") as that term is defined in
Section 2.a.5 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the " _Escrow
Agent_ ") in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be disbursed in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and (b) an amount equal to $500,000 ****
(the " _Member Representative_ _Escrowed Consideration_ ") in an escrow
account (the " _Member Representative Escrow Fund_ ") to be disbursed in
accordance with an agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit B-2_ hereto in
order to cover the costs and expenses incurred by the Member Representative
hereunder (the " _Member Representative Escrow Agreement_ "). The maximum
portion of the Escrowed Consideration and the Member Representative Escrowed
Consideration, if any, that each Company Member may be entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be equal to the Pro Rata Share
of such amounts payable in respect of the Company Membership Units held by
such Company Member.

 



 

2.8 _Working Capital Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Not more than ten (10) Business Days, but in no event less than two (2)
Business Days, prior to the Closing Date, the Company in good faith shall
prepare an unaudited estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
Date (the " _Estimated_ _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") prepared on a basis
consistent with the last audited balance sheet of the Company (including
adjustments normally made at year end), and an estimate of the Working Capital
Amount of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date which
shall be $1,441,010 (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount_ ") based
on the Companys books and records and other information then available. For
purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Working Capital Amount_ " means the excess
of the Companys current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) over the
Companys current liabilities (excluding the current portion of the Long Term
Debt Amount and any liabilities associated with Transaction Expenses and the
Additional Compensation Payments) each as determined in accordance with GAAP,
as modified by this Agreement, applied consistently with the Companys past
practices; (ii) accounts receivable

 



      
 

 



 

resulting from income with respect to royalty revenue earned in the month in
which the Closing Date shall occur shall be recorded as if the royalty revenue
was earned ratably over the month and prorated between the Company and the
Surviving Company on a daily basis, with only accounts receivable arising from
any royalty revenue earned up to the close of business on the Closing Date, as
provided herein, being reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Balance Sheet; and (iii) current liabilities that (A) are incurred
in the month in which the Closing Date shall occur, (B) do not give rise to an
offsetting current asset, and (C) relate to a period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date shall be recorded as if the
expenses to which such current liabilities relate were incurred ratably over
the applicable period and prorated between the Company and the Surviving
Company on a daily basis, with only the current liabilities arising from any
expenses incurred up to the close of business on the Closing Date, as provided
herein, being reflected on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Balance Sheet.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing, the Surviving Company shall deliver to the Member
Representative a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ ") prepared on a basis consistent with the last
audited balance sheet of the Company (including adjustments normally made at
year end), which Closing Balance Sheet will reflect the Surviving Companys
determination of the Working Capital Amount as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital Amount_ "). The Surviving Company
shall give the Member Representative and the Company Accountants an
opportunity to review all records and work papers used in preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Member Representative has not disputed the Surviving
Companys determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount in writing
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, and
assuming the Surviving Company shall have given the Member Representative and
the Company Accountants an opportunity to review all records and work papers
used in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet, the Members Representative, on
behalf of all of the Company Members, shall be deemed to have accepted the
Surviving Companys determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount and
such determination shall be final and binding on the Member Representative,
the Company Members, Parent and the Surviving Company. If the Member
Representative disagrees with the Surviving Companys determination of the
Closing Working Capital Amount and, within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Closing Balance Sheet, notifies the Surviving Company in writing of such
disagreement (such notice setting forth the basis for such disagreement in
reasonable detail), the Surviving Company and the Member Representative
thereafter shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreements. If
the Surviving Company and the Member Representative are unable to resolve any
such disagreements within sixty (60) days after the Surviving Company delivers
the Closing Balance Sheet to the Member Representative, the Surviving Company
and the Member Representative shall submit the dispute to the Independent
Auditor for resolution as an accounting expert and not as an arbiter.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Company and the Member Representative shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve all disagreements over the
Closing Working Capital Amount as soon as practicable, but in any event within
sixty (60) days after the submission of the disputes to the Independent
Auditor. The Surviving Company and the

 



      
 

 



 

Member Representative shall instruct the Independent Auditor to resolve all
disagreements over an item used in computing the Closing Working Capital
Amount at an amount determined by the Member Representative or at an amount
determined by the Surviving Company or at any amount between such amounts, any
such amount as determined by the Independent Auditor shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto. The resolution of such disagreements and of the
Closing Working Capital Amount by the parties hereto or the Independent
Auditor, as applicable, shall be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Company Members and the Member Representative.

 



 

(e) The Independent Auditor will determine the allocation of its costs and
expenses in determining the Closing Working Capital Amount based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the
Member Representative claims the Closing Working Capital Amount is $1,000 more
than the amount determined by the Surviving Company, and the Surviving Company
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Member Representative, and if
the Independent Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Member
Representative $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the
Independent Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Surviving
Company and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Member Representative. Any amounts
allocated to the Member Representative and/or the Company Members pursuant to
this _Section 2.8(e)_ shall be recovered from the Member Representative
Escrow Fund.

 



 

(f) If the Closing Working Capital Amount (as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_) is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount, the Surviving Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing Working Capital Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.8_, deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in immediately
available funds, the difference between the Closing Working Capital Amount and
the Estimated Closing Working Capital Amount (such amount, the " _Excess
Working Capital Amount_ ").

 



 

(g) If the Closing Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Amount, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Working Capital
Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.8_, pay to the
Surviving Company, in immediately available funds recovered from the Escrow
Fund (without regard to the Threshold Amount), the difference between the
Closing Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Amount.

 



 

2.9 _Paying Agent_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, LLC, or such other bank or trust company as shall be mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company, shall act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") in effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration to each Company
Member. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal to the
Initial Merger Consideration to which Company Members shall be entitled at the
Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.6_. Within three (3) Business Days
after the Closing Working Capital

 



      
 

 



 

Amount is finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.8_, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent cash in an amount
equal to the Excess Working Capital Amount, if any.

 



 

(b) In no event later than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent will, or Parent will instruct the Paying Agent to, hand deliver or mail
via First Class mail or a national courier service to each Company Member a
letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ hereto (the
" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (i) specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Membership Units held by the Company
Member shall pass, only upon delivery of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent and containing a representation and warranty
of the Company Member as to title to, and the absence of any Encumbrances on,
such holders Company Membership Units, and (ii) setting forth the
instructions to effect the surrender of the Company Membership Units in
exchange for payment of such Company Members Pro Rata Share of the Initial
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Membership Units held
by such Company Member and the right to receive such Company Members Pro Rata
Share of the Additional Merger Consideration, if any, required to be paid
herein. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of any Company Membership
Units for cancellation to the Paying Agent and delivery of a Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed by a Company Member that is listed on the
Member Certification Statement or a Person that can prove to the Paying Agent
and Parent, in their sole and absolute discretion, that such Person acquired
its Company Membership Units from a Company Member that is listed on the
Member Certification Statement and that any transfer taxes (if applicable)
have been paid, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Company Membership Units shall be
entitled to receive from the Paying Agent in exchange therefor, a wire
transfer of immediately available funds to, or a certified check or bank
drafts payable to, such Person for such Persons Pro Rata Share of the Initial
Merger Consideration and the right to receive such Persons Pro Rata Share of
the Additional Merger Consideration, if any, in respect of the Company
Membership Units held by such Person, and the Company Membership Units so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Company Membership Unit will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all limited liability company purposes to evidence only
the right to receive that amount of the Merger Consideration, the Escrowed
Consideration, if any, and the Member Representative Escrowed Consideration,
if any, which holders of such Company Membership Units are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement. After the Closing Date, there shall be no
transfers of the Company Membership Units. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the date which is one (1) year after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Company all cash,
Letters of Transmittal and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, Company Members shall look only to the Surviving
Company for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws), in each case, without interest
or dividends thereon.

 



 

(d) None of Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, Parent, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Company
Membership Units (or

 



      
 

 



 

dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash deposited by Parent
or Merger Sub with the Paying Agent that is delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Company Membership Units shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority), any such cash in respect of such
Company Membership Units shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Member such amounts as Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment or issuance under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to each Company Member in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(f) All cash paid upon surrender of Company Membership Units in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Company Membership Units.

liability company or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
limited liability company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B)
shall transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
individual, limited liability company or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(ii) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Persons.

 



 

(iii) The rights of the Company Indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.9_
shall be in addition to any rights such Company Indemnified Persons may have
under the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement or comparable Charter Documents, or under
any applicable contracts or Laws.

 



 

5.10 _Cooperation_. In the event that any administrative or judicial
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental or
Regulatory Authority or private

 



      
 

 



 

party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.11 _Payoff Letter._ The Company shall cause the relevant Person(s) to
deliver to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
a fully executed payoff letter, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, setting forth all amounts required to irrevocably pay in full all
of the obligations under the Company Credit Agreement and all documents
executed in connection therewith or pursuant thereto (the _"Payoff Letter"_ ).

 



 

5.12 _Member Certification Statement_. At the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Parent a list, certified by the Companys chief executive officer,
which shall set forth the ownership of the Company Membership Units by holder
as of the date thereof (the _"Member Certification Statement"_ ). The Company
shall not process any transfers of the Company Membership Units after the date
of the Member Certification Statement. If, notwithstanding this _Section
5.12_, the Company Membership Units are transferred after the date of the
Member Certification Statement, the Company shall give immediate notice to
Parent pursuant to the notice provisions herein.

 



 

5.13 _Income Tax Treatment of Merger_. The Merger and related transactions
will be treated as follows for income tax purposes. The Company shall
terminate under section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code upon consummation of the
Merger. The Merger will be treated, from the perspective of the Company
Members, as an acquisition of all of their respective interests in the
Company, and the Company Members shall report gain or loss, if any, resulting
from the deemed sale of their interests in accordance with section 741 of the
Code. For purposes of classifying the transaction from the perspective of
Parent, the Company is deemed to make a liquidating distribution of its assets
to the Company Members. Immediately following such deemed distribution, Parent
is deemed to acquire, by purchase, all of the Companys assets. Parent will
take a cost basis in such assets in accordance with section 1012 of the Code,
and its holding period for such assets begins on the day immediately following
the date of the Merger. Parent shall be solely liable for all Liability for
Taxes, and any other costs, expenses and losses, arising from or related to
any election made by it under Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous
provision under applicable Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

5.14 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Acquisition Price and Liabilities of
the Company (plus other relevant items) shall be allocated among the assets of
the Company for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting) as shown
on the allocation schedule (the _"Allocation Schedule"_ ). A draft of the
Allocation Schedule shall be prepared by Parent and delivered to the Member
Representative within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing
Date. If the Member Representative does not notify Parent, in writing within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the Allocation Schedule, that it objects to one
or more items reflected therein, then the Company Members shall be deemed to
have accepted the Allocation Schedule. If the Member Representative notifies
Parent, in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the

 



      
 

 



 

Allocation Schedule, that it objects to one or more items reflected in the
Allocation Schedule, Parent and the Member Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided, however_ , that if they are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within
thirty (30) days following Parents receipt of the Member Representatives
notice of objection, such dispute shall be submitted to the Independent
Auditor for resolution as a tax expert and not an arbiter, and the parties
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve the
disagreements within thirty (30) days. The Allocation Schedule, as accepted or
agreed to by the parties or finally determined by the Independent Auditor,
shall be binding on Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company,
the Member Representative and the Company Members. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditor shall be borne half by Parent and half by the Company
Members. The parties shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and
claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule. Any adjustments to the Acquisition Price pursuant to this
Agreement shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule.

ARTICLE VII

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Each representation and
warranty contained in this Agreement shall expire on the one-year anniversary
of the Closing Date, except that any such representation or warranty that has
been made the subject of a Claim prior to such expiration date shall survive
with respect to such Claim until the final resolution of such Claim pursuant
to this Article VII. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
made by the Company Members pursuant to their Letters of Transmittal shall
survive indefinitely, unless otherwise expressly stated therein. Unless
otherwise expressly stated herein, all covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

 



 

7.2 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Parent and the Surviving
Company_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, after the
Closing, the Parent and its representatives (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and the party against whom
such claims are asserted under this Article VII is referred to as the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be indemnified and held harmless from and in
respect of any and all damages, losses, claims, deficiencies, liabilities,
suits, demands, judgments and costs and expenses (including costs of
investigations and reasonable attorneys fees) (each a " _Loss_ " and
collectively " _Losses_ ") related to, resulting from, arising out of, or
caused by, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) any breach by Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (a "
_Company Breach Claim_ ");

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any inaccuracy on the Member Certification Statement with respect to any
of the matters to be set forth thereon (a " _Certification Claim_ ");

 



 

(iii) the Companys fraud (a " _Company Fraud Claim_ ");

 



 

(iv) any breach of the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
of the Company Members contained in their Letters of Transmittal (a " _Member
Breach Claim_ ");

 



 

(v) the fraud of a Company Member (a " _Member Fraud Claim_ ");

 



 

(vi) any Transaction Expenses that are not identified on _Schedule
5.5(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and are not included as a
current liability on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Balance Sheet (a "Transaction Expense Claim"); and

 



 

(vii) any Additional Compensation Payments that are not identified on
_Schedule 5.5(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and are not included as
a current liability on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Balance Sheet (a "Compensation Claim").

 



 

7.3 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided in Section 7.2 is
subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(a) No Indemnified Party may recover any Losses with respect to a Company
Breach Claim until the cost of all Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party
based on the same or a substantially similar set of facts giving rise to a
Company Breach Claim exceeds $50,000 (" _Excluded Company Claims_ ").
Additionally, no Indemnified Party may recover any Losses under this Article
VII relating to a Company Breach Claim unless and until the aggregate amount
of all such Losses (without regard to any Excluded Company Claims) exceeds the
Threshold Amount and then only with respect to amounts in excess of the
Threshold Amount.

 



 

(b) The maximum liability of the Company for a Company Breach Claim, unless it
also constitutes a Certification Claim, a Company Fraud Claim, a Member Breach
Claim, a Member Fraud Claim, a Transaction Expense Claim or a Compensation
Claim, shall be limited to **** the Escrowed Consideration remaining in the
Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source for the
Indemnified Parties to collect any Losses with respect to any Company Breach
Claim, unless it also constitutes a Certification Claim, a Company Fraud
Claim, a Member Breach Claim, a Member Fraud Claim, a Transaction Expense
Claim or a Compensation Claim.

 



 

(c) The maximum liability of the Company for a Certification Claim or Company
Fraud Claim shall be limited to **** the Merger Consideration. Any amount to
be paid to the Indemnified Parties for indemnification with respect to any
Certification Claim or Company Fraud Claim, shall, at the sole discretion of
Parent, be satisfied by offsetting such amount against the Escrowed
Consideration in the Escrow Fund and, thereafter if this amount is
insufficient to permit recovery in full with respect to such claims, by
seeking redress directly from the Company Members severally (and not jointly)
based on their respective Pro Rata Shares of the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration received by the Company Members, with recovery from any
Company Member capped at an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the Merger
Consideration actually received by such Company Member.

 



 

(d) No Indemnified Party shall have any indemnification rights with respect to
a Company Breach Claim, a Certification Claim, a Company Fraud Claim, a
Transaction Expense Claim or a Compensation Claim, and no Indemnifying Party
shall have any obligation to provide indemnity hereunder with respect to such
claims, unless such Claim (i) is brought in accordance with Section 7.4 on or
before the date that is one (1) year following the Closing Date, or (ii) also
constitutes a Member Breach Claim or a Member Fraud Claim.

 



 

(e) Any amount to be paid to the Indemnified Parties for indemnification with
respect to any Member Breach Claim or Member Fraud Claim, shall be payable
solely and exclusively by the Company Member that committed the act or breach
giving rise to such claim, (such holder, a " _Breaching Holder_ "). The
maximum liability of any Breaching Holder for a Member Breach Claim or Member
Fraud Claim shall not exceed the amount of the portion of the Merger
Consideration paid to such Breaching Holder. With respect to indemnification
for Member Breach Claims or Member Fraud Claims, Parent shall first seek to
satisfy such a claim by offsetting such amount against the Breaching Holders
remaining pro rata portion of the Escrowed Consideration in the Escrow Fund,
if any, and thereafter if this amount is insufficient to permit recovery in
full with respect to such claims, by seeking redress directly from the
Breaching Holder. In no event shall any Person other than the Breaching Holder
be liable in any respect for any Member Breach Claims or Member Fraud Claims.

 



 

7.4 _Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice_. Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall
promptly notify the Member Representative of any action, suit, proceeding,
demand, claim or breach (a " _Claim_ ") with respect to which the Indemnified
Party claims indemnification hereunder, and such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the individual items of Loss, the basis for the anticipated
liability and the nature of the breach of representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement giving rise to such Losses and in the case of any Member Breach
Claim or Member Fraud Claim, the identity of the Breaching Holder(s), provided
that the failure to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article VII except to the extent, if at
all, that such Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. If such Claim relates to any action, suit,
proceeding or demand instituted against the Indemnified Party by a third party
(a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim in its own name, or, if
necessary, in the name of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ the following
conditions must be satisfied: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have confirmed
in writing, within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such Third-Party
Claim, that it is assuming such defense, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not
have given the Indemnifying Party written notice that it has determined, in
the exercise of its reasonable discretion, that matters of corporate or
management policy or a conflict of interest make separate representation by
the Indemnified Partys own counsel advisable, and (iii) such Third Party
Claim does not involve a Claim for equitable relief

 



      
 

 



 

involving the ongoing operations of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section 7.4(c)_,
(A) it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such
Third-Party Claim, and (B) the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim
with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to
control the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend
such Third-Party Claim, by failing to give notice as provided in this
Agreement or otherwise, or is not permitted to defend such Third-Party Claim,
or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 7.4(c)_, pay, compromise and/or
defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses
based upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(c) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or
settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless such compromise or settlement (i) provides for the
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Liabilities in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) relates to a Claim for
monetary relief only. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, it shall not compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) _Direct Claims_. Following receipt of notice of a Claim on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "),
the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30 day period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of such Direct Claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith for
30 days to resolve such Direct Claim. If no such agreement can be reached
through good faith negotiation within 30 days, either the Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party may resolve such dispute using such remedies as may
be available on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

7.5 _Method and Manner of Paying Claims_. In the event of any Claims under
this _Article VII_, the claimant shall advise the Indemnifying Party by
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of damages
for which indemnification is being sought, the date each such item was paid,
or properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or claim to which such item is related. Except as otherwise
expressly provided for herein, all Claims shall be satisfied pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. With respect to any Claim that is not expressly
required herein to be exclusively satisfied pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy any such obligation by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within 15 Business days of the
date upon which such a Claim is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or is
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this _Article VII_. In no event
shall the Member Representative, in his, her or its capacity as the Member
Representative, have any obligation to satisfy any Claims of an Indemnified
Party.

 



      
 

 



 

7.6 _Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereto acknowledge that, after the Effective Time, the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ constitute the sole and exclusive
recourse and remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to the breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company or the
Company Members contained in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
or in any closing certificate executed and delivered by the Company in
connection herewith or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than Member Fraud Claims). Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto shall in any
event be liable to any Person, on account of any indemnity obligations set
forth in this Article VII or otherwise, for, and each party hereto waives any
right it may have to claim or recover, any indirect, consequential, special,
incidental or punitive damages (including lost profits, diminution in value,
loss of use, damage to goodwill or loss of business) other than any such
damages paid to a third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligations set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it
may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of
their respective representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provision set forth in this _Article VII_ and
except for any such rights, claims, or causes of action arising from fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct. Nothing in this _Section
7.6_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any injunctive or other
equitable relief, including pursuant to _Section 9.13_, to which any Person
shall be entitled.

 



 

7.7 _Amount of Losses_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Loss payable hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to the event
or occurrence giving rise to such Losses and shall be reduced by any amounts
which the Indemnified Party actually receives from third parties in connection
with Losses for which indemnification is sought under this Article VII in each
case net of any expenses incurred in obtaining such proceeds or amounts. The
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
insurance or other claims that may reduce or eliminate Losses. If the
Indemnified Party both collects proceeds from any insurance company or other
Person and receives a payment from the Indemnifying Party (including through
the Escrow Fund) pursuant to this Article VII, and the sum of such proceeds
and payment is in excess of the amount payable with respect to the matter that
is the subject of the indemnity, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
refund the amount of such excess (up to, but not exceeding, the amount of the
payment received from the Indemnifying Party (including through the Escrow
Fund)) to the Indemnifying Party (which excess amount shall be returned to the
Escrow Fund to the extent such amount was originally withdrawn from the Escrow
Fund to satisfy the applicable Claim).

 



 

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take,
all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate Losses in connection with claims
for which a party seeks indemnification under this Article VII.

 



 

(c) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with
respect thereto,

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of
its representatives knew or should have known that any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement is, was or might be inaccurate or unsatisfied.

 



 

7.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Acquisition Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

7.9 _Escrow Disbursements_. The Escrow Amount, less the sum of the amount of
any indemnification claims paid from the Escrow Fund and the amount of any
unresolved claims for payments therefrom, shall, on the one-year anniversary
of the Closing Date, be released by the Escrow Agent to Company Members or
their designees in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

7.10 _Appointment of Member Representative_.

 



 

(a) Peter Sisitsky is hereby appointed as the sole and exclusive
representative for and on behalf of the Company Members (the " _Member
Representative_ "). The Member Representative shall enter into the Escrow
Agreement and the Member Representative Escrow Agreement and take all actions
required or permitted under the terms of, or otherwise deemed necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement with respect to the interests and rights of
the Company Members with respect to the indemnity under Article VII hereof,
and the Member Representative Escrow Agreement and by executing this Agreement
the Member Representative accepts such appointment. No bond shall be required
of the Member Representative and the Member Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services. Notices of communications to or from the Member
Representative pursuant to the notice requirements set forth in _Section 9.1_
of this Agreement shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Member Representative may deliver
notice of communications to any Company Member via email to an address
specified by such Company Member. If the Member Representative is no longer
able or willing to serve in such capacity (or if otherwise desired by the
former holders of Company Membership Units that became entitled to receive, as
of the Effective Time, at least a majority of the Initial Merger Consideration
paid to all holders of Company Membership Units) such former holders may
select a replacement for the Member Representative. The newly appointed
representative shall deliver notice of his or her or its appointment to Parent
as soon as practicable.

 



 

(b) The Member Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
in such capacity while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall
be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company Members shall severally
(and not jointly) indemnify the Member Representative and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Member Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties under any
Transaction Document, which may be paid from, but shall not be limited by, the
Member Representative Escrow Fund.

 



   



 

     
 

 



 

Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Company (after the Closing)
shall have no liability whatsoever for any action or failure to act by the
Member Representative.

 



 

(c) Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Member Representative
made in accordance with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Member
Representative Escrow Agreement shall constitute a decision of all Company
Members and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon every Company Member,
and the Escrow Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company may rely, without
inquiry, upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Member
Representative as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of every
such Company Member.

 



 

(d) The Member Representative is authorized to incur reasonable costs and
expenses in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the
representation of the Company Members in connection with any claims of any
type for which the Company Members, directors, officers, employees or agents
may be liable under this Agreement or otherwise, in each case including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys and accountants fees. The Member
Representative may consult with its own counsel and utilize such other
advisors in carrying out its duties under any Transaction Document as the
Member Representative deems appropriate and, without limiting the foregoing,
the Member Representative shall have full and complete authorization and
protection for any action taken in accordance with the opinion of such
counsel, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by the Member
Representative. Such costs and expenses shall be paid out of the Member
Representative Escrow Fund. The Member Representative shall not be entitled to
any compensation for its time or any other payment, except payment from the
Member Representative Escrow Fund for the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in accordance with this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(e) Pursuant to the terms of the Member Representative Escrow Agreement, the
Member Representative may (i) make withdrawals from the Member Representative
Fund for its own account in accordance with an invoice for expenses and (ii)
direct payments to be made from the Member Representative Escrow Fund as
appropriate. At any time after all matters for which the Member Representative
is responsible under any Transaction Document have been finally concluded, all
amounts payable from the Member Representative Escrow Fund in connection
therewith have been paid and no further action by the Member Representative is
required, and after all indemnity obligations owed to the Member
Representative if any, have been paid or otherwise resolved, any and all
amounts remaining in the Member Representative Escrow Fund, including any
income thereon, shall be distributed by the Member Representative to the
Paying Agent to be distributed to the Company Members in accordance with
_Section 2.9_ if the Paying Agent is still serving in that capacity and,
otherwise, such amounts shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Company Members or their designees in accordance with the provisions of the
Member Representative Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(f) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the requisite Company Members shall
constitute: (i) approval by all Company Members of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Member Representative Escrow Agreement and of all of the
arrangements relating thereto; (ii) approval by all Company Members of the
appointment of the Member Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Member Representative Escrow Agreement and the

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledgement and agreement by all Company Members that all decisions and
rights of the Company Members under any of the Transaction Documents shall
thereafter be made or exercised solely by the Member Representative; (iii) the
approval by all Company Members of the establishment of the Member
Representative Escrow Fund and the administration of the same in accordance
with this _Section 7.10_, and (iv) the approval by all Company Members of the
Member Representative as their agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact with
the power and authority to act in the name, place and stead of the Company
Members in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and to execute all such agreements and documents as
the Member Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(g) The Member Representative shall have reasonable access to information
about the Surviving Company and the reasonable assistance of the Surviving
Companys officers and employees to the extent necessary for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the
Member Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any
nonpublic information from or about the Surviving Company to anyone (except on
a need to know basis to individuals who agree to keep such information
confidential).

 



 

(h) The Member Representative shall (subject to applicable Law) have the power
to:

 



 

(i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Parties) relating to the Transaction
Documents or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or
thereby (except to the extent that the Transaction Documents expressly
contemplate that any such notice or communication shall be given or received
by a Company Member individually);

 



 

(ii) execute the Escrow Agreement as the representative of the Company
Members, and to take such further actions under the Escrow Agreement as the
Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate;

 



 

(iii) act for the Company Members with regard to negotiating, defending,
investigating, settling or taking other actions with respect to any
indemnification or other claims and executing instructions to the Escrow Agent
with respect to disbursement of funds from the Escrow Fund;

 



 

(iv) execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates and documents
that the Member Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents;

 



 

(v) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Members that the Member Representative deems necessary or appropriate in its
sole discretion relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Documents as
fully and completely as the Company Members could do if personally present;

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand arbitration or litigation of, and comply with orders of
arbitrators or courts with respect to, (A) indemnification claims by Parent or
any other Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII or (B) any dispute
between any Indemnified Party and any Company Member, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents;

 



 

(vii) receive and distribute, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or the Member
Representative Escrow Agreement, as applicable, any portion of the Escrowed
Consideration, if any, or the Member Representative Escrowed Consideration, if
any, payable to any of the Company Members or their designees;

 



 

(viii) perform all duties of the Member Representative described in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and

 



 

(ix) take all other actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Member Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt whereof is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

The Escrow Agent is hereby appointed to act as Escrow Agent hereunder, and the
Escrow Agent agrees to act as such as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Escrow Agent represents that it is one of the following: (A) a depository

to national banks under the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and
which is supervised and examined by State or Federal authority having
supervision over banks, and shall have at all times an aggregate capital,
surplus, and undivided profits of a specified minimum amount, which shall not
be less than $100,000,000 (a " _Bank_ "). A true, accurate and complete copy
of the Merger Agreement shall be provided by the Parent to the Escrow Agent
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, solely
for the purpose of providing to the Escrow Agent the defined terms contained
therein (to the extent such terms may appear herein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall have no obligations under and shall not be
bound by and shall not be charged with the knowledge of the contents of the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

 ** _Section 2._** ** ****_Deposit of Escrow Funds_**.

 



 

(a) On the Effective Date, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent in
immediately available funds the Escrow Deposit (together with any investment
income or proceeds received by the Escrow Agent from the investment thereof
from time to time pursuant to _Section 5_ below, collectively, the " _Escrow
Property_ "), and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow Property in an
account established with the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "), and to

Upon receipt of the Escrow Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall send a notice to
Parent and the Member Representative acknowledging receipt of the Escrow
Deposit. Each Company Members proportionate entitlement, expressed as a
percentage, to the Escrow Property upon termination of the Escrow Account is
indicated next to his, her or its name on _Schedule A_ attached hereto. Other
than as provided in _Section 8(d)_, the Escrow Account shall not be subject
to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor or any party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
any Company Member may transfer such Company Members interest in the Escrow
Property upon notice to Parent, the Member Representative and the Escrow
Agent, provided that any such transferee acknowledges that his, her or its
interest in the Escrow Property will be identical in all respect to the
interest transferred to it and that such transferees interest in the Escrow
Property will in all cases remain subject to the terms and conditions of this
Escrow Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Property is being deposited with the Escrow Agent in the Escrow
Account to secure the indemnification rights of the Parent set forth in
Article 7 of the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, and shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees to update promptly the attached _Schedule A_ by written
notice countersigned by the Member Representative and delivered to the Escrow
Agent at such times as information required to be set forth in the attached
_Schedule A_ changes, including, without limitation, in order to reflect the
transfer by a Company Member of such Company Members interest in the Escrow
Property.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent and to hold,
safeguard and disburse the Escrow Property pursuant to the terms and
conditions hereof.

 



 

 ** _Section 3._** ** ****_Claims and Payment_**.

 



 

(a) From time to time on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the one year
anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "), the Parent may
initiate a claim for indemnification for the benefit of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to and subject to Article 7 of the Merger Agreement against the
Escrow Property (a " _Parent Claim_") by delivering simultaneously to the
Escrow Agent and the Member Representative a written notice pursuant to
_Section 15_ of this Agreement (" _Parent Claim Notice_") which shall:

 



 

(1) state that such Parent Claim is being made on behalf of one or more
Indemnified Parties, identifying the Indemnified Party on behalf of which such
Parent Claim is being made;

 



 

(2) state that such identified Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification in respect of such Parent Claim under Section 7.2 of the
Merger Agreement and, if ascertainable, the amount of Losses, after giving
effect to the limitations on indemnification contained in Article 7 of the
Merger Agreement, currently known to be incurred in respect of such Parent
Claim (a " _Covered Loss_ ");

 



 

(3) specify in reasonable detail the individual items of each Covered Loss,
the basis for the liability and the nature of the breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such Covered Losses; and

 



 

(4) in the case of a Parent Claim that constitutes a Member Breach Claim or a
Member Fraud Claim, identify the Breaching Holder and expressly acknowledge
that such claim shall be receivable from escrow solely from such Breaching
Holders respective portion of the Escrow Property; _provided_ , that with
respect to such a Parent Claim, Parent shall also deliver a copy of the Parent
Claim Notice to the Breaching Holder.

 



 

(b) Within 30 days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of a Parent Claim Notice,
the Member Representative or the Breaching Holder, as the case may be, may
deliver to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to the Indemnified Parties who
delivered the Parent Claim Notice) written notice pursuant to _Section 15_ of
this Agreement disputing all or any portion of a Parent Claim (a " _Counter
Notice_ "), in which case such Parent Claim shall be resolved as provided in
_Sections 3(c)_ and _3(d)_ herein. If no Counter Notice is received by the
Escrow Agent by the

 



      
 

 



 

end of such 30-day period, then the dollar amount of the Parent Claim
requested in the Parent Claim Notice as set forth by the applicable
Indemnified Parties shall be deemed established for purposes of this
Agreement, and promptly after the end of such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent
shall pay the Indemnified Parties the dollar amount of the Parent Claim
requested in the Parent Claim Notice; _provided_ _,_ _however_ that in the
case of a Parent Claim that constitutes a Member Breach Claim or a Member
Fraud Claim, such Parent Claim shall be taken solely from that portion of the
Escrow Property to be otherwise distributed to the Breaching Holder on the
Expiration Date and shall be payable only upon the distribution of Escrow
Property from the Escrow Account, if any, to the Company Members upon the
Expiration Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no such payment or delivery
may be made if the Member Representative or the Breaching Holder, as the case
may be, shall have objected pursuant to a timely made Counter Notice. Any
additional payment instructions required for any payment of Escrow Property
pursuant to a Parent Claim shall be the sole responsibility of the Indemnified
Party named in such claim or of the Member Representative or the Breaching
Holder, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) If a Counter Notice is given by the Member Representative or the Breaching
Holder, as the case may be, in a timely manner pursuant to _Section 3(b)_
hereof with respect to a Parent Claim, the Member Representative or the
Breaching Holder, as the case may be, and the Parent shall attempt in good
faith for a thirty (30) day period to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to the disputed Parent Claim. If the Member
Representative or the Breaching Holder, as the case may be, and the Parent
should reach an agreement with respect to any such Parent Claim, they shall
furnish Joint Written Instructions (as defined below) to the Escrow Agent
setting forth such agreement.

 



 

(d) If a Counter Notice is given by the Member Representative or the Breaching
Holder, as the case may be, in a timely manner pursuant to _Section 3(b)_
hereof with respect to a Parent Claim, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse,
and shall continue to hold the Escrow Property subject to such Parent Claim,
pending receipt of either (A) joint written instructions signed by Parent and
the Member Representative or the Breaching Holder, as the case may be,
specifying the agreement of the parties as to the action taken by the Escrow
Agent in respect of such Parent Claim (" _Joint Written Instructions_ "), or
(B) a final non-appealable judgment or order of a court of competent
jurisdiction that contains specific instructions to the Escrow Agent regarding
distribution of the Escrow Property subject to such Parent Claim (a "
_Judgment Notice_ "). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
Joint Written Instructions and distribute Escrow Property from the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms thereof. Any Judgment Notice shall be
accompanied by evidence from the presenting party satisfactory to the Escrow
Agent to the effect that the order is final and non-appealable. The Escrow
Agent shall act on such Judgment Notice and evidence without further question
and shall inform Parent and the Member Representative or the Breaching Holder,
as the case may be, in writing without undue delay. If such Joint Written
Instructions or Judgment Notice indicates that the Indemnified Parties are not
entitled to some portion of the amount claimed in such Parent Claim Notice,
then such portion shall no longer be subject to such Parent Claim, and the
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such portion in the Escrow Account until
such portion is disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) In any case hereunder in which Escrow Agent is to receive instructions to
release, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to entirely rely on such
instructions with no responsibility to calculate or confirm amounts or
percentages to release.

 



 

 ** _Section 4._** ** ****_Termination of Escrow_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate on the date on which there is no Escrow
Property remaining in the Escrow Account (such date, the " _Termination Date_
").

 



 

(b) Promptly following the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Company Members the Escrow Property then held in the Escrow Account,
_less_ the amount of Escrow Property which is equal to the sum of (i) the
Final Reserved Amount (as defined below), and (ii) the amount of any finally
resolved Parent Claim previously received by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
_Section 3(a)_ but not paid that relates to a Parent Claim that constitutes a
Member Breach Claim or a Member Fraud Claim, (which amount shall promptly be
distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with such Parent Claim Notice
and in the manner provided in _Section 2(a)_, except that such claim shall be
payable only from and to the extent of the related Breaching Holders
respective portion of the Escrow Property otherwise to be distributed to such
Breaching Holder on the Expiration Date in accordance with this _Section
4(b)_); _provided_ , that all such payments shall, except as provided in the
preceding clause (ii) and to the extent practicable (subject to, among other
things, authorized denominations and rounding), be paid from the remaining
Escrow Property then held hereunder in accordance with _Schedule A_ as in
effect at such time. The amount of Escrow Property withheld pursuant to
clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, is referenced to herein as "
_Withheld Property_." For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Reserved
Amount_ " shall be equal to the aggregate dollar amount of all claims made in
all Parent Claim Notices delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Member
Representative prior to the Expiration Date, which claims or amounts shall not
have been resolved and paid on or prior to the Expiration Date.

 



 

(c) Any Withheld Property shall be distributed solely in accordance with and
as provided in _Section 3_ hereof. Following the Expiration Date, upon final
resolution of all unresolved or unpaid Parent Claims pursuant to _Section 3_
hereof, and after giving effect to the release to Parent of that portion of
the Withheld Property in respect thereof for which the Joint Written
Instructions or Judgment Notice indicates that the Indemnified Parties are
entitled with respect to such Parent Claims, **** the **** Escrow Agent shall
deliver to the Company Members all remaining Withheld Property, if any, then
held in escrow pursuant to their respective proportionate entitlement to the
Escrow Property as indicated next to his, her or its name on _Schedule A_
attached hereto, as then in effect.

Escrow Agent shall be entitled to entirely rely on written instructions with
no responsibility to calculate or confirm amounts or percentages to disburse.

instruction from the Member Representative (which shall include instruction as

invest the Escrow Property in Eligible Investments, pursuant to and as

timely receipt of such specific written investment instruction from the Member
Representative, the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or duty to invest

that in the event the Escrow Agent shall not have received such written
investment instruction, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to invest any of
the Escrow Property in the Escrow Agents __ "U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit
Account" until such investment instruction is received. All earnings received
from the investment of the Escrow Property shall be credited to, and shall
become a part of, the Escrow Property (and any losses on such investments
shall be debited to the Escrow Account). The Member Representative, on behalf
of the Company Members, acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent is
providing no investment advice and is not responsible for any of the
investment decisions made by the Member Representative. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability for any investment losses, including without limitation any
market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a
payment required hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Tax Reporting_. The Member Representative, on behalf of the Company
Members, agrees that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest or other income
earned from the investment of the Escrow Property shall be reported by the
Escrow Agent as allocated to the party to whom such interest or income is

hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification
number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in case of

identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal

portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow
Property.

instructions and notices of the Member Representative named above and,
thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor
named in a writing executed by a majority-in-interest of the Company Members
filed with the Escrow Agent.

constitute a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Escrow
Agreement, unless such waiver is specified in writing, and then only to the
extent so specified. A waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this

terms of this Escrow Agreement, or of such terms and conditions on any other
occasion. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, consent to an alteration
or modification of this Agreement may not be signed by means of an e-mail
address.

 



 

(c) _Governing Law_. THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED

formation and existence as a legal entity. Each Interested Party also agrees
to provide, upon request, financial statements, licenses, identification and
authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the
entity or other relevant documentation.

or instrumentality thereof (provided that the full faith and credit of the
United States is pledged in support thereof); (ii) obligations (including
certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances) of any domestic commercial
bank having capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000; (iii) repurchase
obligations for underlying securities of the type described in clause (i);
(iv) investment in the Escrow Agents "U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit
Account". If otherwise qualified, obligations of the Escrow Agent or its
affiliates shall qualify as Eligible Investments.

 



 

(b) _Escrow Agent Not Responsible For Investment Decisions_. _ _Absent its
timely receipt of such specific written investment instruction from the Member
Representative, the Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or duty to invest
(or otherwise pay interest on) the Escrow Property; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event the Escrow Agent shall not have received such written
investment instruction, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to invest any of
the Escrow Property in the Escrow Agents "U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit
Account" until such investment instruction is received. All earnings received
from the investment of the Escrow Property shall be credited to, and shall
become a part of, the Escrow Property (and any losses on such investments
shall be debited to the Escrow Account). The Member Representative, on behalf
of the Company Members, acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Agent is
providing no investment advice and is not responsible for any of the
investment decisions made by the Member Representative. The Escrow Agent shall
have no liability for any investment losses, including without limitation any
market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a
payment required hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Tax Reporting_. (i) The Member Representative agrees that, for tax
reporting purposes, all interest and other income from investment of the
Escrow Property shall, as of the end of each calendar year and to the extent
required by the Internal Revenue Service, be reported as having been earned by
the Company Members in accordance with the then-applicable Allocable Portions
set forth on _Schedule A_ , whether or not such income was disbursed during
such calendar year. (ii) Promptly following closing, the Member Representative
shall provide the Escrow Agent with certified tax identification numbers by
furnishing appropriate forms W-9 or W-8 and such other forms and documents
that the Escrow Agent may request. The Member Representative understands that
if such tax reporting documentation is not provided and certified to the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a
portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow
Property. (iii) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the
payment of any taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of the
Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

possible from the Escrow Property. The Member Representative shall indemnify,
defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Property and the
investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by this _Section 1.4(c)_ is in
addition to the other indemnification provided for herein, and shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number_. The Member
Representative on behalf of each of the Company Members agrees to provide the
Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and
returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in case of non-U.S. persons) to the
Escrow Agent upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Member
Representative understands that, in the event their tax identification numbers
are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal Revenue Code, as amended
from time to time, may require withholding of a portion of any interest or
other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Property.

 



 

 ** _Section 6._** ** ****_Member Representative_**.

he has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and
perform this Agreement and to bind all of the Company Members to its terms,
(ii) to give and receive directions and notices hereunder; and (iii) to make
all determinations that may be required or that he deems appropriate under
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Until notified in writing by the Member Representative that he has
resigned or by a majority in interest of the Company Members that he has been
removed, the Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions,
instructions and notices of the Member Representative named above and,
thereafter, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor
named in a writing executed by a majority-in-interest of the Company Members
filed with the Escrow Agent.

determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be
bound thereby, (ii) shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties
as are expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement on its part to
be performed, each of which is ministerial (and shall not be construed to be
fiduciary) in nature, and no implied duties or obligations of any kind shall

shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which might
in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any expense or liability unless

notice, instruction (including, without limitation, wire transfer

provided in a separate written instruction), instrument, statement,
certificate, request or other document furnished to it hereunder and believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person,
and shall have no responsibility or duty to make inquiry as to or to determine
the genuineness, accuracy or validity thereof (or any signature appearing
thereon), or of the authority of the person signing or presenting the same,
and (v) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, including in-house counsel,
and the opinion or advice of such counsel in any instance shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered
or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or
advice of such counsel.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone for any action taken or

gross negligence or willful misconduct in breach of the terms of this
Agreement. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for indirect,
punitive, special or consequential damage or loss (including but not limited
to lost profits) whatsoever, even if the Escrow Agent has been informed of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall have no more or less responsibility or liability on
account of any action or omission of any book-entry depository, securities
intermediary or other subescrow agent employed by the Escrow Agent than any
such book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
has to the Escrow Agent, except to the extent that such action or omission of
any book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
was caused by the Escrow Agents own gross negligence or willful misconduct in
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such
affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person
or dealing as principal for its own account.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any
Escrow Property (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be
taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has
received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form,
or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under
the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be _._

 



 

(f) Unless and except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein, all
deposits and payments hereunder, or pursuant to the terms hereof (including

and expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with resolution of any
claim by any party hereunder.

 



 

(c) The Member Representative covenants and agrees to indemnify the Escrow
Agent (and its directors, officers and employees) and hold it (and such
directors, officers and employees) harmless from and against any loss,
liability, damage, cost and expense of any nature incurred by the Escrow Agent
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or with the administration
of its duties hereunder, including but not limited to attorneys fees and
other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any claim
of liability unless and except to the extent such loss, liability, damage,
cost and expense shall be caused by the Escrow Agents gross negligence, or
willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold
harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall
have and is hereby granted a possessory lien on and security interest in the
Escrow Property, and all proceeds thereof, to secure payment of all amounts
owing to it from time to time hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter

 ** _INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDERING COMPANY MEMBERSHIP UNITS_**

 

( _Please read carefully the instructions below_ )

 



 

1. **_Method of Delivery_** : This Letter of Transmittal must be sent or delivered to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "Exchange Agent"). __Do not send this Letter of Transmittal to The Elk Horn Coal Company, LLC or Rhino Resource Partners LP.__

 



 

2. **_Payment in the Same Name_**: If the check is issued in the same name as the Company Membership Units are registered, the Letter of Transmittal should be completed and signed exactly as the surrendered Company Membership Units are registered. If any of the Company Membership Units surrendered hereby are owned by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal exactly as written on stock records of Elk Horn maintained by the Exchange Agent. If any Company Membership Units are registered in different names, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations. Letters of Transmittal executed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations, or others acting in a fiduciary capacity who are not identified as such in the registration must be accompanied by proper evidence of the signers authority to act.

 



 

3. **_Payment in Different Name_** _:_ If the section entitled "Special Payment Instructions" is completed, then signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is an Eligible Institution. If the surrendered Company Membership Units are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made to a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or if the payment is to be made to a person other than the registered owner(s), then this Letter of Transmittal must be signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered owners appear on stock records of Elk Horn maintained by the Exchange Agent with the signatures guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided herein.

 



 

4. **_Special Payment and Delivery Instructions_** : Indicate the name in which and address to which the check are to be sent if different from the name and/or address of the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal. If Special Payment Instructions have been completed, a Substitute Form W-9 must also be completed for the person named therein, and that person will be considered the record owner.

 



 

5. **_Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Company Membership Units_** : You will not receive your check unless and until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, to the Exchange Agent.

 



 

6. **_Substitute Form W-9_**: Under the federal income tax law, a non-exempt stockholder is required to provide the Exchange Agent with such stockholders correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on the enclosed Substitute Form W-9. If the certificate(s) are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed Substitute Form W-9 guidelines for additional guidance on which number to report. _Failure to provide the information on the form may subject the surrendering stockholder to 28% backup withholding on the payment of any cash._ The surrendering stockholder must check the box in Part 4 if a TIN has not been issued and the stockholder has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future. If a TIN has been applied for and the Exchange Agent is not provided with a TIN before payment is made, the Exchange Agent will withhold 28% on all payments to such surrendering stockholders of any cash consideration due for their former Company Membership Units. Please review the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional details on what Taxpayer Identification Number to give the Exchange Agent.

 



 

7. Non-Foreign Status Certifications. Every stockholder must complete the appropriate version of the **INDIVIDUAL NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** included below or the **ENITY NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** included below. A stockholder that is a US person must execute the attached **INDIVIDUAL NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** or **ENITY NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** , as appropriate, in order to claim exemption from withholding under US income tax law of an amount equal to 10% of the amount realized by such stockholder on the sale of Company Membership Units. Non-US Persons must also execute the appropriate INDIVIDUAL **NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** or **ENITY NON-FOREIGN STATUS CERTIFICATION** by indicating that the individual or entity is not a US Person as instructed.

 



 

8. **_Substitute Form W-8_**. Under the federal income tax law, in the case of any disposition of a United States real property interest by a foreign person, the transferee is required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount realized on the disposition. In general, a foreign person is a nonresident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate. To the extent the undersigned is such a foreign person, the undersigned is required to provide the Exchange Agent with a duly executed Substitute Form W-8BEN in the form attached to provide the information requested on such form, including the undersigneds U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number. Failure to provide such number will preclude a refund of any portion of the tax withheld.

 



 

9. **_Stock Transfer Taxes. _**If payment is to be made to any person other than the registered holder, or if surrendered Company Membership Units are registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing the Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or such person) payable as a result of the transfer to such person will be deducted from the payment for such Company Membership Units if satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted.

 



 

All questions as to the validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
Company Membership Units pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal will be
determined by the Exchange Agent and Rhino and such determination shall be
final and binding. Exchange Agent and Rhino reserve the right to waive any
irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Company Membership Units. A
surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have
been cured or waived.

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a holder of Company Membership
Units who tenders Company Membership Units that are accepted for exchange may
be subject to backup withholding. In order to avoid such backup withholding,
the holder of Company Membership Units must provide the Exchange Agent with
such holders correct taxpayer identification number and certify that such
holder is not subject to such backup withholding by completing the Substitute
Form W-9 provided herewith. In general, if a holder of Company Membership
Units is an individual, the taxpayer identification number is the Social
Security number of such individual. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with
the correct taxpayer identification number, the holder of Company Membership
Units may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.
For further information concerning backup withholding and instructions for
completing the Substitute Form W-9 (including how to obtain a taxpayer
identification number if you do not have one and how to complete the
Substitute Form W-9 if the Company Membership Units are held in more than one
name), consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9.

 



 

Certain holder of Company Membership Units (including, among others, all
corporations and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup
withholding and reporting requirements. In order to satisfy the Exchange Agent
that a foreign individual qualifies as an exempt recipient, such holder of
Company Membership Units must submit a statement, signed under penalties of
perjury, attesting to that individuals exempt status, on a properly completed
Form W-8BEN, or successor form. Such statements can be obtained from the
Exchange Agent.

 



 

Failure to complete the Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause the
Company Membership Units to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may require the
Exchange Agent to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made
pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income
tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of a person subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained provided that the
required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

 



 

NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 MAY RESULT IN
BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF A PORTION OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE
MERGER. PLEASE REVIEW THE ENCLOSED GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

* An international organization or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

 

* A foreign government or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof.

 



 

Payees that may be exempt from backup withholding include:

* A dealer in securities or commodities required to register in the United States, the District of Colombia, or a possession of the United States.

 **Privacy Act Notice**.  Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest, or certain other income to give taxpayer identification numbers to
payers who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the numbers for
identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of tax returns. The
IRS may also provide this information to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation and to cities, states and the District of Columbia to
carry out their tax laws. The IRS may also disclose this information to other
countries under a tax treaty, or to Federal and state agencies to enforce
Federal nontax criminal laws and to combat terrorism. Payers must be given the
numbers whether or not recipients are required to file tax returns. Payers
must generally withhold a portion of taxable interest, dividend, and certain
other payments to a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer identification
number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

 



 

 **Penalties**

 



 

 **(1) Penalty for Failure to Furnish Taxpayer Identification Number.  **If
you fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due
to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

 



      
 

 



 

 **(2) Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to Withholding. 
**If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no
imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

 



 

 **(3) Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information.  **Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.

 



 

 **(4) Misuse of Taxpayer Identification Numbers**.If the requester
discloses or uses taxpayer identification numbers in violation of federal law,
the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
